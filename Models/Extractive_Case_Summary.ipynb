    "text = \"\"\"The People v. Anthony Yu, filed on February 2, 2024, is an unpublished case from the California Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District (Placer County, Case No. C096075, Superior Court No. 62-166376). This case involves an appeal from Anthony Yu, herein the defendant, who was convicted on multiple charges of physical and sexual abuse towards his two children. The defendant's appeal cites violations of his rights, insufficiencies in evidence, and erroneous allowances of testimonies in the trial court. \\n\\nAs background, the defendant became the sole guardian of his two children, born in 2004 and 2006 to the defendant and his former girlfriend, T.W., when she left around 2007. The defendant and his children lived with his parents in Rancho Cordova from 2008 for approximately eight years. During this time, two counts of lewd acts on a child were committed. All three shared a bedroom in the grandparents' house, initially sleeping in one bed until a bunk bed was provided for the children. Despite this, the defendant\\u2019s daughter reported instances where she was touched inappropriately, and both children shared accounts of physical abuse. \\n\\nIn January 2016, they moved to their own home, where the abuse reportedly worsened due to a lack of supervision. About six months later, the children were removed from the home and placed in foster care after a neighbor noticed bruises on the daughter and upon inquiry, she disclosed the abuse. The children were subsequently placed with their mother. \\n\\nThe defendant\\u2019s appeal is premised on three central arguments. First, the defendant claims that his right to self-representation during the pretrial period was violated as he was not given adequate resources to prepare his defense. Secondly, he contends that the trial court erred by denying his midtrial motion to discharge his retained counsel and represent himself again. Lastly, the defendant asserts that the court made a mistake by allowing testimonies from two of his previous girlfriends, including the children\\u2019s mother, about other instances of physical and sexual abuse.\\n\\nThe court disagrees with the first three points raised by the defendant. However, the defendant\\u2019s argument that his conviction on two counts of dissuading a witness should be reversed due to insufficient evidence, and that the case should be remanded to the trial court following the Penal Code section 654, was validated. Therefore, the judgment on all but two counts is affirmed and a resentencing is ordered. \\n\\nThe evidence relevant to these appeal arguments does not challenge the sufficiency of evidence to support the other 21 convictions of the defendant. Rather, the evidence presented is summarised and tailored to support the arguments made in the appeal.\"\"\""
