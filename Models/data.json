["In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals under case number PD-0018-23, the appeal came from Continental Heritage Insurance Company, represented by agent Pat Kinnard, who also operates under the name Pat Kinnard Bail Bonds. The appellant was in dispute with the State of Texas concerning a motion for rehearing following an opinion on discretionary review from the Fifth Court of Appeals in Dallas County. The opinion for the unanimous Court was delivered by Keller, P.J.\n\nThe dispute in question centered around whether civil filing fees are part of the court costs that a bonding company, or in some cases, a criminal defendant, must pay if a bond is forfeited. The complexity of the issue arises because while generally, the answer is \"yes\", there are exceptions when a statute exempts the State from liability for a particular filing fee. An exemption can also be overridden if there is another provision that mandates a civil defendant to pay the fee if the State is victorious. The appellant filed a motion for rehearing after the opinion on original submission and the court granted the motion for rehearing, withdrew its previous opinion, and replaced it with a new one. The appellant's arguments influenced part of the reasoning, but the ultimate decision remained the same.\n\nIn terms of background, the case involved a bond forfeiture and associated costs. Darrell David had been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. However, he failed to show up at the trial, leading to the forfeiture of a $10,000 bond under a judgment nisi. A final judgment of forfeiture was signed on October 9, 2020, where the bond was forfeited and the payment of $100 interest, $396 in court costs, and any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the county for the return of the criminal defendant were required. \n\nThe clerk issued a bill of costs on the same day, itemizing a series of charges that totaled $496. These charges included judicial salary fees, clerk fees, court reporter service fees, law library fees, and more. \n\nFollowing this, Continental Heritage filed a motion to correct costs on October 26, 2020. The motion argued that the collection of civil filing fees was not permitted in bond forfeiture proceedings and identified specific fees that it believed it should not have to pay. These contested fees were comprised of the majority of the charges listed in the bill of costs. The motion also contended that the authority to dispute costs was granted by Code of Criminal Procedure article 103.008.\n\nThe dispute was brought before the trial court where the State argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to revise costs under Article 103.008 and maintained that the costs were valid. On the other hand, the appellant argued that the court did have the jurisdiction to address the costs and maintained that it should only have to pay some of the court costs, which it believed totaled $94. The trial court ruled that it had jurisdiction to address the issue of court costs but denied the appellant's motion to revise the costs. \n\nIn response to this decision, the appellant filed a notice of appeal on November 10, 2020. The appeal was then taken to the court of appeal.","IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS, CASE NO. WR-93,259-02\n\nAPPLICANT: TIVIRUS CRAFT, EX PARTE \n\nTHE MATTER IS REGARDING AN APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, CASE NO. 11084-A IN THE 411TH DISTRICT COURT, ORIGINATING FROM TRINITY COUNTY\n\nPer curiam.\n\nJUDICIAL OPINION\n\nTivirus Craft, the applicant, was found guilty of one count of arson, one count of tampering with evidence, and an additional count of arson. He was handed down a life sentence, twenty years, and two years incarceration respectively for each count. He has since lodged an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the county of conviction, which the district clerk subsequently transmitted to this Court. Refer to TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.07 for further details.\n\nCraft argues that his right to an appeal was violated due to the district clerk's delay in both filing the necessary documents with the appeals court and in notifying the appointed appellate counsel in a timely manner. Based on the evidence presented within the records, the applicant qualifies for relief due to a systemic failure.\n\nRelief is thus granted as per the precedent set in Ex parte Riley, 193 S.W.3d 900 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). Craft is permitted to lodge an out-of-time appeal to his conviction in cause number 11084 from the 411th District Court of Trinity County. The trial court must establish within ten days from the date of this Court\u2019s mandate whether Craft is indigent. In the event that Craft is indeed indigent and requests representation by counsel, the trial court must appoint a lawyer to represent him on his direct appeal. In case Craft decides to proceed with his appeal, he must register a written notice of appeal in the trial court within thirty days from the date of this Court\u2019s mandate.\n\nCopies of this opinion are to be dispatched to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2013Correctional Institutions Division and the Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nDelivered: January 17, 2024\nUnpublished opinion.","In the Criminal Appeals Court of Texas, two separate cases were reviewed under file numbers: PD-1182-20 and PD-1213-20. The first case involved the State of Texas as the appellant and Trenton Kyle Green as the appellee. The second case consisted of Bobby Carl Lennox, also known as Bobby Carl Leanox, as the appellant against the State of Texas. Both cases were reviewed upon the state's petition for discretionary review from the Sixth Court of Appeals for Gregg County and Lamar County, respectively.\n\nThe opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Slaughter, with Justices Keller, Hervey, Richardson, Newell, Keel, Walker, and McClure joining. Justice Yeary concurred with the opinion. The consolidated cases required interpretation of the 2017 amendments to the Texas Penal Code Section 32.21, known as the forgery statute. According to the statute, an offense is committed if a person forges a writing with the intent to defraud or harm another. The base-level offense is considered a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nIn 2017, the Legislature included a new subsection, (e-1), which presented an alternative 'value ladder' offense-classification scheme. As per this updated provision, if it is shown during the trial of an offense that the actor engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, then the offense classification is based on the value of the implicated property or service. The possible offense level begins at a Class C misdemeanor (for forgeries involving property or services valued at less than $100) and stretches to a first-degree felony (for forgeries involving property or services valued at over $300,000). \n\nHowever, the 'value ladder' provision did not replace two original subsections in Section 32.21. These established exceptions to the default offense classification, namely subsections (d) and (e). These original subsections independently state that forgery of a specified type of writing, irrespective of the defendant's motive for committing forgery or the value of any goods or services involved, is either a state-jail felony or a third-degree felony. Subsection (d) states that it is a state-jail felony to commit forgery of one of the enumerated types of financial instruments. Subsection (e) implies that it is a third-degree felony to commit forgery of currency or other governmental records or instruments.\n\nThe 2017 amendments also appended language to subsections (d) and (e) stating that these provisions are \"subject to Subsection (e-1).\" The court's task was to resolve how to apply Section 32.21's competing offense-classification schemes. Specifically, it had to determine when subsections (d) and (e) apply, and when subsection (e-1) applies.\n\nAccording to the relevant portions of Section 32.21, a person commits an offense if he forges a writing with intent to defraud or harm another. Except as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (e-1), an offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor. Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state jail felony if the writing is or purports to be one of various types of financial or commercial instruments. Still, subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony of the third degree if the writing is or purports to be part of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps, a government record mentioned in Section 37.01(2)(C), or other instruments issued by a state or national government or by a subdivision of either, or part of an issue of stock, bonds, or other instruments signifying interests in or claims against another person.\n\nIf proven during the trial of an offense under this section that the actor engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or a service, the offense under this section varies. It can be a Class C misdemeanor if the property or service value is less than $100, a Class B misdemeanor if the value is $100 or more but less than $750, a Class A misdemeanor if the value is $750 or more but less than $2,500, a state jail felony if the value is $2,500 or more but less than $30,000, a felony of the third degree if the value is $30,000 or more but less than $150,000, a felony of the second degree if the value is $150,000 or more but less than $300,000, and a felony of the first degree if the value is $300,000 or more. This forms the basis of the 'value ladder' provision introduced in 2017, and the court was tasked with interpreting and applying this provision in light of the existing forgery statute.","In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case number PD-0963-19, the appellant, Harry Donald Nicholson Jr., came up against the State of Texas. This case was the subject of Nicholson Jr.'s petition for discretionary review from the Tenth Court of Appeals in Navarro County. \n\nThe dispute revolves around TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(a), which declares that an offense is committed when a person intentionally tries to escape from an individual they know to be a peace officer who is trying to lawfully arrest them. The argument put forward by the majority, to which Justice Yeary disagrees, is that it is not necessary for the accused to be aware of the lawfulness of the officer\u2019s attempt to arrest them. \n\nThe court does acknowledge the importance of plain language when interpreting statutes, as postulated in the Majority Opinion and referencing Nguyen v. State. However, in this case, the court considers the language of the statute in question to be ambiguous, despite it being clear and unambiguous. The court thus considers itself free to determine the interpretation of the statute, an approach that contrasts sharply with a textualist approach to statutory interpretation. \n\nThe court makes a number of other significant errors, according to Justice Yeary. Firstly, it overlooks the clear implications of a 1993 amendment to the relevant statute. The court claims that this amendment merely preserves an \u201cexception\u201d to the offense, while Justice Yeary argues that the legislature could not have been clearer in eliminating the former exception and strengthening the culpable mental state in the definition of the offense. \n\nThe court then claims that the literal interpretation of the current version of the statute leads to an absurd outcome. This is because it believes that this result does not align with the legislative intent, ascertained from sources entirely separate from the statutory language. This approach is not one that Justice Yeary can support.\n\nDespite the disagreements outlined, Justice Yeary concurs with the court's ultimate decision on the case for reasons detailed later in the document. \n\nHowever, he raises a preliminary question regarding why the court is even addressing the issue of whether Section 38.04(a) requires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful. This point does not seem to affect the court of appeals\u2019 final decision on the case, and the court does not provide an explanation. \n\nThe court of appeals had reversed Nicholson Jr.'s conviction and returned the case for a new trial. The Court, while responding to Nicholson Jr.'s petition for discretionary review, confirmed that decision. However, the reason for the court of appeals\u2019 decision to reverse the conviction had nothing to do with the issue the Court is currently addressing. The court of appeals reversed the conviction due to a failure in the jury charge to instruct the jury that the accused must have intentionally tried to escape from a peace officer who was trying to lawfully arrest him.","In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Case No. PD-0653-23, the State of Texas, acting as the appellant, appealed against Anthony Andrew Valle, the appellee. The case focused on the appellee's petition for discretionary review originating from the First Court of Appeals, Harris County. \n\nThe appellee was initially charged with the aggravated sexual assault of a minor and pleaded not guilty, choosing to present his case before a jury per Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.021(a), (e). He made an election pursuant to Article 37.07, \u00a7 2(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, indicating his preference for the jury to decide the punishment. As stipulated by the statute, such an election should be executed before the commencement of voir dire. However, the appellee's election was file-stamped on November 9, 2021, a day following the onset of voir dire.\n\nThe jury later found the appellee guilty. During the punishment phase, he presented a motion to recuse the trial judge and sought a mistrial. His recusal motion was approved, and the newly appointed judge granted his motion for a mistrial concerning both guilt and punishment phases.\n\nIn the subsequent appeal, the State posited that the appellee did not deserve a mistrial on guilt. The court of appeals concurred, deducing that the appellee's election, being filed a day after voir dire had commenced, invalidated the trial court's decision to approve a mistrial concerning guilt under Article 37.07, \u00a7 2(b). Therefore, the court of appeals overturned the trial court's order that had granted the appellee's motion for a mistrial on the guilt phase but upheld the order that granted a mistrial on the punishment phase. This decision was documented in State v. Valle, No. 01-22-00279-CR (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 24, 2023).\n\nIn response, the appellee filed a petition for discretionary review, asserting that the file-stamped date of November 9, 2021, on his election was a clerical error. He cited other documents in the record that were unambiguously file-stamped with incorrect dates. Therefore, he requested the court to grant his petition, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and abate his case.\n\nIn conclusion, the court granted the appellee's petition for discretionary review, nullified the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case back to the court of appeals. The court of appeals was directed to abate the case to allow the trial court to ascertain whether the November 9, 2021 date was a clerical error and, if so, determine the actual date when the appellee's election was filed. This directive was aligned with the provisions of TEX. R. APP. P. 44.4 and Taylor v. State, 247 S.W.3d 223, 223\u201324 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) which suggests that, in the face of a conflicting record, the court of appeals should abate the case to allow the trial court to clarify its intended action. If it is established that the election was filed before the start of voir dire, the court is to reconsider the State's point of error which argued that the appellee was not entitled to a mistrial on guilt. \n\nThis decision was delivered on January 17, 2024, and was not published for broader dissemination.","Citation: The Supreme Court of Texas, HNMC, Inc. v. Francis S. Chan, Individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Leny Rey Chan, Jonathan Chan, and Justin Chan, No. 22-0053, argued September 14, 2023.\n\nThe following is a detailed examination of the case, which involves a personal injury claim and the responsibilities of a property owner in regard to the safety of an adjacent public roadway, particularly in relation to negligent third-party drivers. The unfortunate incident involved a nurse who was hit and fatally injured by such a driver while crossing the public street adjacent to the hospital she worked in. \n\nThe trial court and court of appeals had previously determined that the hospital had a unique, case-specific duty to the nurse due to the particular layout of its parking lot and exit, which ostensibly created a scenario where injuries to others were foreseeable. However, this case examines whether the assignment of such specific duties is warranted when established duty rules are applicable to the given factual situation.\n\nAccording to the established duty rules, the hospital, as the occupier of the premises, had a limited duty based on its control over certain sections of the adjoining public right-of-way. However, there was no evidence indicating that any hazardous condition within the hospital's control in the public right-of-way was the cause of the nurse's injuries. As a result, the court reversed the previous judgment and rendered a take-nothing judgment.\n\nThe background of the case is as follows:\n\nThe defendant, HNMC, owns and operates a hospital and a fenced parking lot situated in Northwest Houston. The hospital lot and premises are separated by Cali Drive, a North-South street that is owned and maintained by Harris County. The county\u2019s right-of-way for Cali Drive extends beyond both sides of the street, incorporating the curb, grass medians, and sidewalks.\n\nThe hospital has an exit that opens onto a staircase leading down to the sidewalk adjacent to Cali Drive, situated in the middle of the block. HNMC constructed a concrete pad near the bottom of the stairs, within the boundary of the county right-of-way, positioned between the sidewalk and the street. This pad is located across from the driveway that vehicles use to enter and exit the parking lot. Interestingly, the hospital exit and parking lot driveway do not perfectly align, with the driveway being a few feet north of the hospital exit. HNMC had also placed traffic control signs in the county right-of-way to the north of the driveway.\n\nThere are crosswalks at each end of the block, which link the hospital and the parking lot. However, instead of using these crosswalks, many patients, visitors, and employees who leave the hospital at this exit simply cross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, entering the lot through the driveway. A crosswalk existed in the middle of the block until 2011, but it was abandoned, and over time, its markings faded. \n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, several vehicular accidents involving pedestrians occurred on Cali Drive. Concerned, HNMC wrote to the county in 2009, requesting the implementation of new safety measures on Cali Drive. The county conducted a traffic study, introduced some safety measures, and recommended additional safety measures for HNMC to implement. HNMC, however, did not implement these recommendations.\n\nIn 2015, after HNMC's refusal to implement the recommended safety measures and after the markings of the abandoned crosswalk had mostly faded, Leny Chan, an HNMC employee for over 30 years, was tragically killed while crossing Cali Drive. She was leaving work and heading to her car in the HNMC parking lot. She exited the hospital and began to cross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, aiming to enter the parking lot via the driveway.\n\nSimultaneously, James Budd was beginning to exit the parking lot in his vehicle. He pulled up past the traffic control signage situated in the right-of-way on his right and stopped at the driveway. He looked both ways before deciding to turn left out of the parking lot to proceed south on Cali Drive. Tragically, he hit Chan while making the left turn. Emergency measures were promptly taken, but Chan did not survive.","The citation refers to the appeal case number 22-2089, submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, Mitchellville Plaza Bar LP, against the defendant, The Hanover American Insurance Company. This case is conducted in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and was initially presented in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, at Greenbelt, presided over by Paul W. Grimm, Senior District Judge. \n\nMitchellville Plaza Bar LP appeals against the district court's judgment which favored Hanover American Insurance Company's cross-motion for summary judgment on Mitchellville\u2019s claims of breach of contract and bad faith emerging from an insurance dispute. Mitchellville had claimed that Hanover wrongly rejected coverage under its insurance policy for property damage inflicted by turkey vultures to the rooftop of one of Mitchellville\u2019s properties. However, Hanover dismissed coverage based on a clause in the insurance policy which excluded coverage for damage created by an \u201cinfestation\u201d of birds. This appeal aims to challenge this decision.\n\nThe district court's granting of summary judgment is subject to de novo review, considering the facts in a manner most favorable to the non-moving party. The summary judgment is correctly awarded only when the movant demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute over any material fact and that the movant is rightfully entitled to judgment as per the law.\n\nThe appeal acknowledges that the only disputed issue in its breach of contract claim is whether or not the \u201cinfestation\u201d policy exception is applicable to its claim. Under Pennsylvania law, contractual interpretation issues are considered questions of law. The paramount goal of contract interpretation is to decipher the intent of the contracting parties. If the contract language is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the parties is to be discerned from the document itself. In such instances, the contract\u2019s language is given its commonly accepted and plain meaning. However, when ambiguity exists, parol evidence is acceptable to explain, clarify, or resolve the ambiguity. In the event of unambiguous contracts, the court interprets them as a matter of law, however, when ambiguity arises, the resolution is typically left to the jury.\n\nThe appellant's lawyers are Brian S. Goodman from Goodman & Donohue, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland. The appellee is represented by Margaret Fonshell Ward from Downs Ward Bender Herzog & Kintigh, P.A., Hunt Valley, Maryland. The circuit judges in this case are AGEE, QUATTLEBAUM, and RUSHING.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal by Mitchellville against the district court's verdict favoring Hanover's cross-motion for summary judgment is affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The court concurs with the district court's interpretation of the \u201cinfestation\u201d clause in the insurance policy, which led to the denial of coverage for the damage caused by turkey vultures to Mitchellville\u2019s property. This unpublished per curiam opinion does not constitute binding precedent in this circuit.","The appeal case number 22-1027 of the United States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit involves Siobhan James, the plaintiff-appellee, and RPS Holdings, LLC, also known as Capital Cabaret, the defendant-appellant. The appeal originated from the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in Greensboro, overseen by Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld. The case, marked as 1:20-cv-00134-LPA, was argued on September 19, 2023, and decided on January 19, 2024. \n\nThe presiding judges for this appeal were Circuit Judges Harris and Quattlebaum, and Senior Circuit Judge Keenan. The decision resulted in the case being vacated and remanded with instructions, as per the unpublished per curiam opinion. The appellant was represented by Luke Charles Lirot from Luke Lirot, P.A., Clearwater, Florida, and Michael Strickland from Michael W. Strickland and Assoc., Raleigh, North Carolina. The appellee was represented by Gilda Adriana Hernandez and Charlotte C. Smith from Law Offices of Gilda A. Hernandez, PLLC, Cary, North Carolina. \n\nThe crux of this case revolves around a motion to compel arbitration in a putative class action. The central point of contention is whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an entity could prove it was the corporate employer who had entered into an arbitration agreement with its employee. The supposed agreement demanded, among other things, that the employee be obliged to submit to arbitration any wage-related claims against the employer. The district court ruled that the entity failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish an enforceable arbitration agreement. \n\nAfter a comprehensive review of the records, the order of the district court was vacated. It was concluded that in accordance with Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the court should have conducted a trial to resolve whether the parties had entered into an enforceable arbitration agreement. \n\nThe initial complaint was filed by Siobhan James, asserting a putative class action against her \u201cemployer,\u201d \u201cPRS Partners, LLC, d\/b\/a Capital Cabaret\u201d (PRS). James claimed that she worked as an \u201cexotic dancer\u201d at PRS\u2019s \u201cCapital Cabaret Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Morrisville, North Carolina,\u201d and that PRS violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (the FLSA) and the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act by failing to compensate its dancers as required by these laws. \n\nJames also filed a motion for conditional certification of a proposed class, specifically, all exotic dancers who had worked at \u201cDefendant\u2019s Capital Cabaret\u201d gentlemen\u2019s club for the last several years prior to filing the lawsuit. \n\nIn response, PRS filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that James\u2019s claims were subject to arbitration in accordance with an agreement between the parties. To support its motion, PRS submitted three exhibits: (1) a copy of James\u2019s United States passport; (2) a three-page, signed arbitration agreement (the alleged agreement); and (3) a second set of \u201csignatures\u201d on a separate page that referred to an \u201cEntertainer Orientation Packet.\u201d\n\nThe arbitration agreement states that it was made \u201cby and between\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d and the \u201cEntertainer,\u201d which are identified in the agreement in handwriting as \u201cCap Cab\u201d and \u201cS.

USA v. MARTREY ANTWAIN NEWBY, a\/k\/a Trey, Appeal Number: 21-4018, Document Number: 49, Filed: January 19, 2024. \n\nThe appeal case of Martrey Antwain Newby, also known as Trey, against the United States of America was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit under appeal number 21-4018. The original case was heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, at Greenville, with presiding District Judge Louise W. Flanagan. \n\nThe court's decision was made on January 19, 2024, following arguments presented on September 22, 2023. The panel of judges included Wynn, Quattlebaum, and Heytens. The sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing as per the published opinion written by Judge Heytens and joined by Judge Wynn. However, Judge Quattlebaum wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\nThe appellant, Martrey Antwain Newby, was represented by Eric Joseph Brignac of the Office of the Federal Public Defender in Raleigh, North Carolina, with additional briefing by G. Alan DuBois, Federal Public Defender. The appellee, the United States of America, was represented by Kevin James Barber of the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. Additional briefings for the appellee were provided by Kenneth A. Polite Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Lisa H. Miller, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Joel S. Johnson from the Appellate Section, Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.; as well as G. Norman Acker III, Acting United States Attorney, and David A. Bragdon, Assistant United States Attorney from the Office of the United States Attorney, Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThe appellant, Martrey Newby, has been incarcerated for over ten years, with a scheduled release date in 2028. In the initial sentencing, the district court included discretionary conditions of supervised release in its written judgment that were not orally announced during the court proceedings. This was identified as an error in line with the United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020) case. \n\nSubsequently, the district court modified Newby\u2019s sentence under the purview of the First Step Act of 2018, and the court\u2019s amended judgment claimed to carry forward those same conditions. The appellant has since appealed this judgment, requesting the Court to remand for another round of sentencing. \n\nThe court concluded that Newby\u2019s challenges are properly before them, given the specific context of this case. On evaluating the merits of the appeal, the court decided to vacate Newby\u2019s sentence and remand the case for a full resentencing.\n\nOn the initial trial in 2008, Newby was convicted of six non-violent drug offenses. The sentence included a 425-month incarceration period and a 10-year term of supervised release. \n\nDuring the post-trial sentencing hearing, the district court announced various discretionary conditions of supervised release. However, its written judgment added several more such conditions. Newby appealed this sentence on unrelated grounds, which were rejected in an unpublished per curiam opinion. See United States v. Newby, 403 Fed. Appx. 809 (4th Cir. 2010).\n\nAlmost a decade later, Newby filed a pro se motion seeking a sentence reduction under the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5222. The district court assigned counsel and ordered a revised presentence investigation report.\n\nNewby objected to the new report\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, identifying an error in how the original judgment described one of his offenses of conviction. The district court concluded the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d was to correct the clerical error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. After doing so, the court\u2014applying the First Step Act\u2014adjusted Newby\u2019s Guidelines range and reduced his sentence to 294 months in prison and four years of supervised release. The court\u2019s resentencing order concluded: \u201cExcept as expressly modified herein, the amended judgment carries forward all terms of \u201d the previous one. The amended judgment contains the same discretionary conditions of supervised release.","The unpublished appeal numbered 23-4338 was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with the United States of America as the plaintiff-appellee and Montello Marquette Hood as the defendant-appellant. The appeal was lodged from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, at Rock Hill, under the senior district judge, Joseph F. Anderson, Jr. The case was submitted on January 4, 2024, and decided on January 19, 2024, with Judges Wilkinson, King, and Agee reviewing the case.\n\nThe appeal pertains to the district court's judgment which revoked the defendant's supervised release and sentenced him to the time served. The defendant appealed this decision. However, the Court of Appeals did not find any reversible error, hence the district court's judgment was affirmed.\n\nThe district court may revoke a defendant's supervised release based on a preponderance of the evidence indicating a violation of supervised release, as per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The Court of Appeals reviews the factual findings of the district court underlying a revocation of supervised release for clear errors and the final decision to revoke the supervised release for abuse of discretion, following the case United States v. Cohen, 63 F.4th 250, 254, cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 165 (2023). When revoking supervised release, the district court needs to substantiate the evidence it relied upon for the Court of Appeals to understand the reasons behind the revocation, as per United States v. Patterson, 957 F.3d 426, 434 (4th Cir. 2020). A written decision is not necessary, provided that the transcript and record are sufficiently comprehensive for the reviewing court to understand the basis of the trial court's decision.\n\nThe defendant claimed that the district court's factual findings were not substantial enough for a meaningful appellate review. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the court's ruling might not have been precisely articulated, it deemed the ruling sufficient for their review. The Court of Appeals identified two possible interpretations of the district court's ruling: first, that the court might have considered the two assessments at Catawba Area Mental Health Center as one incident, referring to this and the defendant's failure to attend an appointment at Three Trees Center for Change; second, the court might have disregarded the Three Trees incident and considered solely the two Catawba assessments. Given that these incidents occurred close in time and were discussed at the two hearings, the Court of Appeals deemed the record adequate for review.\n\nThe defendant also claimed, based on the Cohen case, that the district court erred in revoking his supervised release, arguing that he did not fail to participate in treatment and that the court improperly equated participation with perfect compliance. The Cohen case held that a district court committing an error in finding that the defendant violated the condition requiring him to participate in a sex offender treatment program by not following the rules of that program. The Court of Appeals recognized that noncompliance with rules could eventually preclude further participation but emphasized that the treatment provider did not consider rule breaches as equivalent to non-participation, as per Cohen, 63 F.4th at 254.","CITATION:\n\nTHE THIRTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS\nCase Number: 13-23-00209-CR\n\nArmando Gomez alternatively known as Armando Gamez Jr., Armando Gomez Jr., and Armando Cisneros Gomez Jr.\n                                                                               Versus\nThe State of Texas\n\nThe case was on appeal from the 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas with the trial court cause number as 2022-DCR-0903.\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nFollowing deliberation on the appeal, THE THIRTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS arrived at the conclusion that the verdict of the lower court stands justified and as such, is to be upheld. \n\nIn accordance with this judgment, the decision of the lower court is hereby AFFIRMED. \n\nThe court further instructs that this decision be certified to the court of first instance for compliance. \n\nThe above verdict was delivered on the 18th day of January, 2024.","CITATION: NUMBER 13-23-00209-CR, COURT OF APPEALS, THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG. \n\nPARTIES: \n\nAppellant: ARMANDO GOMEZ, also known as ARMANDO GAMEZ JR., ARMANDO GOMEZ JR., and ARMANDO CISNEROS GOMEZ JR. \n\nAppellee: THE STATE OF TEXAS.\n\nThis case was on appeal from the 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas.\n\nOPINION: \n\nThe judgment was delivered by Chief Justice Contreras, alongside Justices Benavides and Tijerina, of the Thirteenth District Court of Texas.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND: \n\nThe appellant, Armando Gomez, was convicted for the possession of a controlled substance in the amount of 400 grams or more, categorized as a first-degree felony under the Texas Penal Code, Section 481.115(f). The jury concluded the trial by sentencing Gomez to twenty-five years of imprisonment. The only contention of Gomez on appeal was that the trial court mistakenly admitted the testimony of law enforcement officers who were not wearing body cameras as required under Texas Occupation Code Section 1701.655. The decision of the lower court was affirmed in this appeal.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, Officer Joel Padilla of the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office Special Investigations Unit, was informed of a vehicle possibly containing narcotics en route to his location. He was also provided a description of the vehicle. He pulled over by the expressway to wait for the said vehicle. About thirty minutes later, a vehicle matching the provided description appeared, which was later discovered to be owned by Gomez. Officer Padilla followed the vehicle, observed Gomez weaving unsafely through traffic and noticed a broken brake light on his vehicle. Consequently, Officer Padilla pulled Gomez over. \n\nAfter explaining the traffic violations to Gomez, Officer Padilla asked him if there were any narcotics present in the vehicle. Gomez's response was negative. However, he agreed to Officer Padilla's request for a vehicle search and signed a waiver form to that effect. The waiver form was later submitted as evidence.\n\nShortly after the traffic stop began, Deputy Angel Perez arrived at the scene with a drug-sniffing dog. The dog signaled a positive alert towards the front seat and the dashboard of the vehicle. Both Officer Padilla and Deputy Perez testified to noticing mismatched screws and some loose screws on the dashboard. Upon removing the dashboard, they discovered a hidden package of cocaine. Gomez was subsequently arrested and taken to the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDeputy Carlos Martinez interviewed Gomez at the sheriff's office where he read him his Miranda rights. Gomez signed a waiver form reiterating these rights. He subsequently confessed to intending to transport the cocaine to Louisiana for sale. Deputy Martinez compiled Gomez\u2019s confession into a written document and had Gomez review and sign it.\n\nGomez sought to suppress the statement he made to Deputy Martinez. His defense during the pretrial hearing was that his statement was not voluntary as his signature on the Miranda waiver appeared different from his signature on the confession. The trial court rejected the motion to suppress. Both the Miranda waiver and Gomez\u2019s written confession were admitted into evidence. During cross-examination, Gomez's counsel asked Deputy Martinez about the disparity in Gomez's signatures on the documents. Deputy Martinez affirmed that he personally witnessed Gomez sign both documents.\n\nAfter deliberation, the jury found Gomez guilty and sentenced him to twenty-five years of imprisonment.\n\nISSUES RAISED:\n\nIn his only contention on appeal, Gomez argued that the trial court erroneously admitted the officers\u2019 testimonies given that they were not equipped with body-worn cameras as mandated by Texas Occupation Code Section 1701.655. This section requires that any law enforcement agency receiving a grant for body-worn cameras or operating a body-worn camera program should adopt a policy for the use of such cameras. Gomez maintained that the officers' non-compliance with Section 1701.655 called into question the reliability of the evidence submitted, causing a structural error that rendered a fair trial unattainable and violated his right to a fair trial.","Case Appeal Number: 13-22-00289-CV\n\nAppellate Court: Thirteenth District Court of Appeals, Texas, Corpus Christi \u2013 Edinburg\n\nAppellants: Blaine Crews and Hannah Crews\n\nAppellees: Richard Galvan and Sonia Galvan\n\nThe appeal originated from the 445th District Court of Cameron County, Texas.\n\nOpinion of the Court: \nThe opinion was delivered by Justice Benavides with Justices Longoria and Tijerina sitting on the bench.\n\nThe appellants, Blaine Crews and Hannah Crews, are contesting the decision of the trial court. They argue that the court erred in granting summary judgment and not adhering to its own scheduling order when deliberating on the merits of the Galvans\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.\n\nBackground of the Case:\n\nThe focus of this case and appeal is the legal doctrine of res judicata. Therefore, there are two proceedings to consider in our analysis. Firstly, the original case was filed on November 5, 2018, by the Galvans against the Crewses, with the trial court cause number 2018-DCL-06387-I. The Galvans sued the Crewses for assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation per se and public disclosure of private facts. On December 12, 2018, the Crewses motioned to dismiss the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). This motion was initially rejected by the trial court, but this decision was later reversed by the appellate court.\n\nFollowing this, the Crewses filed a counterpetition on April 17, 2020, alleging that the Galvans had intentionally inflicted emotional distress and conducted malicious civil prosecution. The Crewses claimed that the Galvans' insistence on pursuing a groundless defamation claim resulted in damages. The Galvans, in response, moved on several occasions to nonsuit their claims without prejudice. In a later hearing, they verbally amended these motions to be with prejudice.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, the trial court approved an order dismissing all of the Galvans\u2019 claims, excluding their defamation claim, with prejudice. Subsequently, on June 9, 2020, the trial court approved an order dismissing the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim with prejudice and awarded the Crewses attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and sanctions. On October 27, 2020, the trial court issued a clarification order, recognizing that the Galvans\u2019 non-suiting of their claims barred the Crewses\u2019 counterclaims. The Crewses filed a new trial motion on November 25, 2020, arguing that the Galvans\u2019 nonsuit of their claims did not affect the Crewses\u2019 right to affirmative relief. However, the trial court denied this motion in a written order on January 26, 2021.\n\nThe proceeding leading to this appeal began when the Crewses filed an original petition in the trial court cause number 2020-DCL-05323-I on October 30, 2020, in which they reiterated the same causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious civil prosecution as in the initial proceeding. In response, the Galvans filed an amended answer on February 5, 2021, which posited the affirmative defense of res judicata and sought sanctions against the Crewses for filing a frivolous lawsuit.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Galvans moved for summary judgment on their affirmative defense of res judicata. They argued that the trial court's order dated October 27, 2020, represented a prior final judgment on the merits by a competent court, and that the identity of the parties involved, as well as the claims asserted by the Crewses in the current proceeding, were identical to those in the prior proceeding. In contrast, the Crewses countered that their previously filed counterclaims in the first proceeding had not been adjudicated and thus, res judicata was inapplicable.","Citation: \n\nThirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas.

The case revolved around Murray's claims for a declaratory judgment and equitable reimbursement on a jointly owned property. \n\nThe trial court declared that Robinson was not liable for the property's taxes, mortgage payments, or costs related to maintenance, repair, and improvement incurred by Murray. However, it was established that Robinson was responsible for half of the insurance premiums paid for the structures on the property. \n\nMurray presented three issues for the court's consideration, which were reframed and construed as two issues. The primary issues of contention were: (1) the trial court\u2019s error in not granting judgment in Murray's favor, and (2) the trial court\u2019s decision to issue declarations not backed by the pleadings. The court of appeals upheld the judgment of the trial court, affirming its previous decision.\n\nCase Details:\n\nMurray and his wife, Florentina Murray, owned around seventy-eight acres of property in Travis County, Texas, which made up their homestead. After Florentina's death in 1997, Robinson, Florentina's only child from a prior marriage, filed an affidavit of heirship declaring her interest in the property according to Texas's intestate succession laws (TEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 102.003, 201.003(c)).\n\nFollowing Florentina's death, Murray continued to claim the property as his homestead and resided there, while Robinson lived elsewhere. In 2019, Murray sued Robinson, demanding contribution and reimbursement, foreclosure of an equitable lien, and a declaratory judgment. Murray asserted that as a joint owner, Robinson should be liable for fifty percent of the sums he paid for taxes, insurance, and repairs for the property. \n\nAt the bench trial, Murray testified that there was no probate administration for Florentina's estate. He also pointed out that upon her death, Florentina owed approximately $300,000 in debts, which did not include any lien on the property. Following Florentina's passing, Murray secured two loans on the property\u2014$238,477.50 in 1998 and $410,000 in 2001. He maintained that the proceeds from these loans were largely used to settle Florentina's debts. However, Murray did not present any documentary evidence that would support his claim.\n\nMurray sought reimbursement from Robinson for the principal and interest paid toward $300,000 of the 2001 loan, totaling approximately $611,000 at the time of trial. He also demanded Robinson pay her share of the homeowner's insurance, totaling $55,021.25, which constituted sixty-seven percent of the total costs, as that portion was allocated towards insuring the property's structures. Murray testified that he had paid a total of $335,997 in property taxes from 1998 to the time of trial, and of those taxes, $7,277.47 was for the year 1997, which he paid in 1998.\n\nIn summary, the crux of Murray's reimbursement claim against Robinson was to cover half of the expenses he had incurred in maintaining the property, including property taxes, insurance, and repairs, as well as principal and interest paid on a mortgage taken out on the property after Florentina's death. This case, therefore, was an exploration of the rights and responsibilities of joint ownership of property under the law.\n","This legal document cites the appeal case of Daniel Garcia against The State of Texas as the appellant and appellee, respectively. The case, referenced as NUMBER 13-22-00303-CR, was taken before the Thirteenth District Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi - Edinburg, from the 24th District Court of DeWitt County, Texas.\n\nThe appellant, Daniel Garcia, is challenging his convictions for assault on a public servant and retaliation, both classified as third-degree felonies, which have been further augmented due to his prior felony convictions under the Texas Penal Code's sections 22.01 and 36.06, as well as 12.42(d). Garcia raised five issues in his appeal, questioning the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions; the trial court's denial of his motion to strike four juror candidates for cause; the refusal by the trial court to declare a mistrial after the jury breached its instructions; and the judgment's nullity due to inconsistency with the sentence determined by the trial court. While the court affirmed the convictions, some modifications were made.\n\nThe background of the case shows that Garcia was indicted on a single count each of public servant assault and retaliation. Despite entering a plea of not guilty, the case proceeded to trial. At trial, the appellant's sister, Oralia Garcia, testified that she had called the police in the early morning hours of July 24, 2020, after her brother arrived at her doorstep around 2 to 3 a.m. in a barefoot and shirtless state, refusing to vacate the premises. \n\nOralia detailed the unfolding of the events, stating that after offering her brother a drink, he threw a planter towards her. She swiftly closed the front door to evade being struck by the planter and called the police after her brother refused to leave and kept knocking on the door. Oralia further clarified that her brother lived in a small trailer on her property and that she was his financial supporter. While it was common for him to demand food or drink from her, his aggressive behavior on the aforementioned evening was unprecedented.\n\nDeWitt County Sheriff's Officer Juan Julian Ruiz Jr., who responded to Oralia's call, testified that he found Garcia sitting on the porch swing, half-naked and with only one shoe on. According to Deputy Ruiz, Garcia appeared to be under the influence of narcotics or alcohol and threatened him. Despite being instructed to leave the premises or face arrest, Garcia refused. Garcia then progressed towards Deputy Ruiz and verbally assaulted him. The deputy informed Garcia that he would be handcuffed, which resulted in Garcia resisting and physically assaulting Deputy Ruiz, who then called for backup.","Citation: \n\nAppeals Court Thirteenth, Case No. 13-22-00303-CR, Daniel Garcia against The State of Texas.

HB1 ALTERNATIVE HOLDINGS, LLC, Appellee. On appeal from County Court at Law No. 5 of Nueces County, Texas. \n\nIn this memorandum opinion, Chief Justice Contreras and Justices Benavides and Tijerina presided. Appellant Glenn Edward Steed raised an objection to the trial court\u2019s final judgment of possession awarded to appellee HB1 Alternative Holdings, LLC (HB1) under the Texas Property Code Ann. \u00a7 24.002. The two issues Steed presented were: (1) the trial court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the dispute over the title to the subject property, and (2) the alleged error by the trial court because of a previously obtained temporary restraining order (TRO), which Steed argued should have \"barred\" the foreclosure sale of the subject property. The court affirmed the judgment.\n\nJanet Steed, the appellant\u2019s mother, was the sole owner of the property located on Dorsal Street in Corpus Christi, Texas. On March 23, 2012, she entered into a home equity conversion mortgage, also called a reverse mortgage, on the home. This included a note of $495,000 and an \"Adjustable Rate Home Equity Conversion Deed of Trust.\" The deed of trust named \"Janet K. Steed\" as the \"Borrower,\" the property in question as \"the Property,\" and Generation Mortgage Company, the successor in interest to Nationstar Mortgage LLC, d\/b\/a Champion Mortgage Company (Champion), as \"Lender.\" \n\nThe deed of trust clearly stated the agreement between the lender and the borrower that the lender would have a fully enforceable lien on the property, and that in cases of default, foreclosure under a power of sale would be pursued. If the property were sold under these circumstances, the borrower or any person holding possession of the property through the borrower would be expected to immediately surrender possession of the property to the purchaser.\n\nJanet defaulted on the loan before her death in 2018. On September 12, 2018, Champion sent a notice of default to Janet\u2019s estate. In February 2019, after the default was never cured, Champion filed a lawsuit against Janet\u2019s heirs, including Steed, to foreclose on the property. On July 15, 2020, Champion obtained a final judgment allowing foreclosure. However, Steed managed to secure a TRO, effective August 31, 2021, which halted the foreclosure sale.\n\nDespite the TRO, the mortgage remained in default. The district court, in the proceeding in which the TRO was issued, entered an agreed judgment on April 11, 2022, dismissing Steed\u2019s claim against Champion and allowing Champion to proceed with foreclosure. Consequently, HB1 purchased the property during the foreclosure sale on August 2, 2022. \n\nHB1 filed a forcible-detainer action in justice court seeking immediate possession of the property in September 2022, and an eviction notice was given to Steed. Steed did not appear in court, leading to a default judgment of eviction in favor of HB1.\n\nSteed appealed the default judgment, and a de novo bench trial was held in the county court on November 14, 2022. Steed argued that the TRO issued in August 2021 should have prevented the foreclosure sale, that he had no knowledge of or consent to the agreed judgment in his district court case against Champion, and that he was not notified of the subsequent foreclosure sale on August 2, 2022. \n\nAt the trial, Steed revealed that the property was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. He testified that Janet had submitted an insurance claim but faced delays in its processing. Steed also claimed he was living in the property and repairing it at the time of the eviction notice. The court, however, did not find these arguments persuasive. The trial court held that Steed was not a party to the reverse mortgage and did not have an enforceable interest in the property. It also found that the TRO had no effect on the foreclosure sale as it had been dismissed in the agreed judgment.\n\nFurther, the court found no merit in Steed's claim that he was not notified of the foreclosure sale. It held that Steed's admission that he was living in the property at the time of the eviction notice implied he was likely to have received notice about the foreclosure sale. Hence, the trial court affirmed the default judgment of eviction in favor of HB1.\n\nThis decision underscores the importance of understanding and complying with the conditions of a reverse mortgage, including the requirement to surrender possession of the property following foreclosure. Furthermore, it highlights the limited nature of TROs and their inability to indefinitely prevent a foreclosure, especially when the underlying mortgage remains in default.","CITATION:\n\nCourt of Appeals, Thirteenth District\n\nCase Number: 13-22-00595-CV\n\nGlenn Edward Steed, Appellant\nv.\nHB1 Alternative Holdings, LLC, Appellee\n\nThis appeal arises from the County Court at Law No. 5 of Nueces County, Texas\nInitial Trial Court Cause No. 2022-CCV-61269-5\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nThe Court of Appeals, Thirteenth District, having duly deliberated on this matter, hereby ascertains that the original judgment rendered by the trial court is to be sustained.

The affirmation of the trial court's judgment upholds the integrity of the judicial process and serves as a reminder of the importance of thorough judicial review in ensuring justice.","In the Court of Appeals, Thirteenth District of Texas, Corpus Christi \u2013 Edinburg, Case Number 13-24-00043-CV, titled In Re Shannon Moczygemba, sought to address a petition for Writ of Mandamus filed by Shannon Moczygemba on the 17th of January, 2024. \n\nIn this petition, Shannon Moczygemba claims that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to set aside a mediated settlement agreement and by refusing to set a hearing on a motion to declare the agreement unenforceable (as per Texas Family Code Annotated sections 6.602, 153.0071). Concurrently, she also filed an emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings, inclusive of the final hearing that was scheduled for January 18, 2024. This move was made pending the resolution of her petition for writ of mandamus (as per Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10).\n\nThe writ of mandamus is viewed as an extraordinary and discretionary remedy as observed in previous cases like In re Allstate Indemnity Co., In re Garza, and In re Prudential Insurance Company of America. The relator, in this case, Shannon Moczygemba, carries the onus of demonstrating two key points: one, that the trial court abused its discretion and second, that she is left without an adequate remedy by appeal (as referenced in In re USAA General Indemnity Co., In re Prudential Insurance Company of America, and Walker v. Packer).\n\nUpon thorough examination and full consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus and all relevant law, the Court concluded that Shannon Moczygemba did not successfully meet the burden of proof necessary to obtain relief. Consequently, the Court denied the petition for writ of mandamus without prejudice. Furthermore, her emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings was also denied by the Court. \n\nThe presiding Justice for the case was Nora L. Longoria who delivered and filed the Memorandum Opinion on the 18th of January, 2024.","In the appellate case numbered 13-23-00531-CR, brought forth by Jennifer Lopez against The State of Texas, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has rendered its judgment. This appeal was made from the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas under the trial court cause number A-23-5138-CR.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has determined that the appeal is to be dismissed. The Court has ordered the dismissal in accordance with the detailed reasoning provided in its official opinion. \n\nMoreover, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has commanded that this decision be certified and forwarded to the lower court for adherence and implementation. This judgment was issued on January 18, 2024.\n\nThe roles of appellate courts are crucial in the justice system, as they provide an avenue for parties to challenge and seek redress for legal decisions they believe are erroneous. The appellate courts oversee the trial courts and ensure that they are conducting fair and just proceedings, and that legal decisions comply with the relevant laws and case precedents.\n\nIn this case, though the appellant, Jennifer Lopez, contested the decision of the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals saw no legal error in the lower court's judgment, culminating to the dismissal of the appeal.\n\nThe dismissal of an appeal can occur for a variety of reasons, such as the appellant's failure to present compelling arguments, procedural errors, absence of legal merit in the appeal, or if the appellant fails to comply with the rules of the court. However, the specific reasons for the dismissal of this appeal can only be identified by examining the court\u2019s opinion, which includes the legal reasoning and the analysis of the issues raised in the appeal.\n\nConsequently, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals' decision to dismiss the appeal and the directive for the lower court's observance of this decision signifies the Court's affirmation of the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas' judgment. This effectively concludes the appellate process for Jennifer Lopez in this matter, against The State of Texas, unless further appeal avenues, such as the Supreme court, are explored.\n\nThis case exemplifies the intricate workings of the justice system, where decisions made at lower courts can be appealed at higher courts for review. However, the appellate courts' power is not absolute and is anchored on legal principles, procedural rules, and the strength of the arguments presented. The appellate courts are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is appropriately served. In instances where they find that lower courts have acted in accordance with these principles, as demonstrated in the current case, they affirm the rulings, thereby reinforcing the credibility of the justice system. The certification and enforcement of their decisions by the lower courts further underscores the hierarchical nature of the court system.\n\nThe date of the judgment, January 18, 2024, indicates the timeline within which the involved parties must react. Depending on the specific court rules and the nature of the judgment, the parties may have a designated period within which to seek further redress if they are discontented with the appellate court\u2019s decision.","Case Reference: NUMBER 13-23-00531-CR\n\nJudicial Authority: COURT OF APPEALS, THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG\n\nParties Involved: JENNIFER LOPEZ, Appellant, versus THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee.\n\nOrigin of Appeal: On appeal from the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas.\n\nCase Review Memorandum: Considered by Chief Justice Contreras and Justices Benavides and Tijerina, the Memorandum Opinion was given by Justice Tijerina.\n\nCase Overview: The appellant lodged a notice of appeal, aiming to contest a ruling in the trial court case number A-23-5138-CR.

(2024). Judgment in Jose A. Gonzalez and Teresa M. Gonzalez v. Miguel A. Trevino and Angelica Trevino. Case No. 13-23-00197-CV. \n\nBackground:\n\nThis case is an appeal from the 150th District Court of Bexar County, Texas, originating from the trial court cause number 2021CI08480. The appellants in this case are Jose A. Gonzalez and Teresa M. Gonzalez, with the respondents being Miguel A. Trevino and Angelica Trevino.\n\nJudgement:\n\nThe Thirteenth Court of Appeals, after careful consideration and review of this case, has decided that the appeal should be dismissed. This decision was reached based on the Court's evaluation of the legal arguments and evidence presented by both the appellants and respondents.\n\nIn line with this decision, the Court officially dismissed the appeal, as documented in its written opinion. The Court's opinion is the written explanation of the Court's decision, which takes into account the facts of the case, the relevant laws, and the legal principles applied in reaching the decision. The Court's opinion serves as the definitive record of the decision and provides the reasoning behind the dismissal of the appeal.\n\nFurthermore, the Court adjudged the costs of the appeal against the appellants, Jose A. Gonzalez and Teresa M. Gonzalez. This means that Gonzalez and Gonzalez are legally responsible for paying the expenses associated with the appeal. These costs can include filing fees, attorney's fees, and other expenses related to the preparation and presentation of the appeal. The adjudication of costs against the appellants serves as a legal sanction for the unsuccessful appeal and is intended to compensate the respondents for their expenses in defending against the appeal.\n\nCertification:\n\nThe Court further ordered that the decision be certified below for observance. This means that the Court's decision is officially acknowledged and recorded in the court below \u2014 the 150th District Court of Bexar County, Texas, in this case.

Judgment. \n\nThe Thirteenth Court of Appeals, upon considering the appeal, arrived at the conclusion that the appeal warrants dismissal. Acting as per their opinion, the Court directed the appeal to be dismissed. Appellant was subsequently adjudged the costs of the appeal. \n\nThe Court further ordains this decision to be certified below for observance. \n\nThe citation above pertains to the judgment delivered on January 18, 2024. \n\nAs this is a legal document, it is paramount to note that each court case and its subsequent proceedings are unique and treated on a case-by-case basis. The court's decision in this particular case is a result of the specific circumstances, facts, and legal arguments presented. It should not be misconstrued as a universally applicable precedent. The Thirteenth Court of Appeals, like all appellate courts, reviews the decisions of lower courts. In this case, it scrutinized the proceedings of the 92nd District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas. \n\nIn accordance with the court's procedure, the appellant (Mary Ashley Gomez) brought the case against the appellee (Juan Jose Rojas) to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals after an unsatisfactory ruling at the district court level. It is important to note that an appeal is not a retrial or a new trial of the case. The appellate courts do not usually consider new witnesses or new evidence. Appeals are based on arguments that there were legal errors in the trial or sentencing. \n\nThe Court, after reviewing the case, decided to dismiss the appeal. The reason for dismissal can vary significantly from case to case, and no specific reason for the dismissal is given in the citation above. However, appeals are frequently dismissed when the court concludes that no legal errors occurred in the lower court, when the appeal is considered frivolous, or when the appellant fails to follow legal procedures for the appeal. \n\nThe reference to costs adjudged against the appellant means that the appellant was ordered to pay for the costs associated with the appeal. These costs can include fees for filing the appeal, attorney's fees, and other court costs. This is a common practice in many legal systems and is meant to discourage frivolous appeals. \n\nFinally, the Court ordered this decision to be certified below for observance. This means the court's decision is sent to the lower court, informing it of the decision, and it should recognize and implement the court's decision. \n\nThe citation's final date, January 18, 2024, likely refers to the judgment date or the date when the court's decision was rendered. \n\nWhile interpreting the citation, it should be noted that this summary is an interpretation based on standard legal procedures and terminologies. The actual details and specifics of the case might vary.","CITATION NO. 13-23-00418-CV\n\nAPPELLATE COURT\n\nTHIRTEENTH JURISDICTION OF TEXAS\n\nCORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG\n\nMARY ASHLEY GOMEZ,                                                        Plaintiff,\n\n                                        versus\n\nJUAN JOSE ROJAS,                                                           Defendant.\n\n\n                In review from the 92nd District Court\n                    of Hidalgo County, Texas.\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL MEMORANDUM\n\n                Presiding Justices Longoria, Silva, and Pe\u00f1a\n                Judicial Memorandum by Justice Longoria\n\n       The plaintiff lodged an appeal notice on September 29, 2023.

Consequently, the Court mandates to uphold the verdict passed by the trial court. \n\nThe financial burden associated with the appeal process is deemed to be borne by the appellant, Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr.\n\nIn addition, this court instructs that this ruling be duly acknowledged and enforced in the lower court.\n\nDate: January 18, 2024","In the case of Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr. against Morgan Graham (Case Number: 13-23-00091-CV) in the Thirteenth District Court of Appeals in Texas, the appellant, Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr., contested the trial court's dismissal of his motion under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) to dismiss the claim of Morgan Graham, the appellee. Graham's claim was lodged under Section 253.131 of the Texas Election Code. \n\nThree issues were raised by Gonzalez, which were restructured for clarity. The first point for consideration was the standing of Graham to bring her claim. The second contention was the applicability of the TCPA to his claim and the failure of Graham to substantiate the claim with clear and precise evidence. The third argument claimed an infringement of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution if Graham's claim against him were to be allowed.\n\nThe history of the case is as follows: On December 13, 2021, Gonzalez submitted an application to contest Graham for the position of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. Incumbent County Chair Graham rejected Gonzalez's application on the grounds of incompleteness. Gonzalez sought a writ of mandamus requesting a review of Graham's decision. Upon review, it was found that Gonzalez's application did not meet the stipulated requirements of the election code, prompting Graham to reject it, barring Gonzalez from participating in the March 2022 Republican primary election, which Graham eventually won.\n\nOn August 2, 2022, Graham filed her original petition contending that Gonzalez failed to comply with Title 15 of the Texas Election Code. She claimed that Gonzalez did not appoint a campaign treasurer with the Texas Ethics Commission upon declaring his candidacy. She further alleged that Gonzalez received political contributions and authorized campaign expenditures without having an appointed campaign treasurer. Graham sought damages under Section 253.131 of the Texas Election Code as a result.\n\nIn response, Gonzalez filed a TCPA motion to dismiss on November 21, 2022, stating that Graham's claim was in response to his exercising his First Amendment rights to free speech, petition, and association. He also claimed that the suit was in reaction to activities protected by Section 27.010(b)(1) of the civil practice and remedies code.\n\nGonzalez also argued that Graham had no standing to bring her claim as she suffered no injury. He stated that Graham ran for county chair uncontested and did not have to spend any money to defeat her nonexistent political opponent. He stipulated that any injury suffered by Graham was a \u201csovereign injury\u201d rather than a \u201cproprietary injury,\u201d alleging that neither the Texas Election Code nor the Texas Constitution authorize private citizens to assert sovereign injuries. Gonzalez concluded that if Section 253.131 were to provide standing for politicians to sue their opponents, it should be deemed unconstitutional as applied to him since no civil damages for violations of campaign finance law can surpass the basic constitutional principle of standing. The court affirmed the decision.","In the case under review by the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, identified as case number 13-23-00070-CR, the State of Texas versus Michael Anthony Vargas, emanated from the County Court at Law No. 5 of Cameron County, Texas under the trial court cause number 19-CCR-4564. \n\nAfter thoughtful consideration of the appeal, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has arrived at the consensus that the appeal should be dismissed. This decision was not taken lightly or in haste, but after careful scrutiny of the facts, considerations and legalities presented during the course of the appeal. \n\nIt is hereby ordered, in accordance with the express opinion of the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, that the said appeal be dismissed.

Both causes arose from the 94th District Court of Nueces County, Texas. This Court has interpreted Khnanisho's plea as a petition for writ of mandamus and a notice of appeal for our appellate cause number 13-23-00597-CV, in accordance with the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 19.1, 25.1, and 52. \n\nThe petition for writ of mandamus brought forth by Khnanisho includes allegations against the trial court judge, court staff, service of process, and debt collectors. \n\nIt is acknowledged that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary and discretionary remedy. The petitioner must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion and that the petitioner does not have an adequate remedy by appeal. Additionally, mandamus relief can be granted if a trial court issues an order \"beyond its jurisdiction,\" rendering the order void from the beginning.\n\nThe burden of proof lies with the petitioner to demonstrate eligibility for mandamus relief. The petitioner must provide a statement of facts supported by citations to \"competent evidence included in the appendix or record,\" and must present a clear and concise argument for the claims, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. The petitioner is also expected to provide a sufficient appendix or record to substantiate the mandamus relief claim. \n\nUpon thorough review and consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus and the relevant law, the Court believes that Khnanisho has not fulfilled his burden to obtain relief. Therefore, the petition for writ of mandamus is denied. Khnanisho's appeal remains under review in our appellate cause number 13-23-00597-CV. \n\nJustice: Clarissa Silva\n\nThe final verdict was rendered and recorded on January 19, 2024.\n","In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, an individual case was brought to trial. Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., the plaintiff in Case No. 15-CV-944 (JMC), filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA). This civil action sought access to records pertaining to Hernandez's prosecution by the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas. This request was made under the jurisdiction of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, as well as the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. \n\nAfter deliberation, the court ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion for summary judgment (ECF 35), and denying the cross-motion for summary judgment filed by Hernandez (ECF 38). \n\nHernandez had previously been prosecuted for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. This occurred within the Western District of Texas. As a result, he is currently incarcerated at the Fort Worth Federal Correctional Institution. On February 5, 2014, Hernandez sent a letter to the EOUSA requesting any records about him, as per the rights granted to him by FOIA and the Privacy Act. This letter was subsequently sent to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO\/TXW).\n\nA paralegal at USAO\/TXW was tasked with finding records related to Hernandez's request. She located 459 pages of documents that could be potentially responsive. This comprised 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of correspondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). After determining that the public records and grand jury transcripts were non-releasable, she dispatched the remaining pages to the EOUSA. These documents contained correspondence, attorney work product, and DEA documents. \n\nThe EOUSA then sent the 8 pages of DEA documents back to the DEA, leaving only 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work product. From these documents, the EOUSA deemed only 12 pages as responsive to Hernandez's request. \n\nOut of these 12 pages, the EOUSA fully released 4 pages, partially released 1 page, and fully withheld 7 pages based on FOIA exemptions. Hernandez then appealed the EOUSA\u2019s decision to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP), seeking production of all 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work product that had been located by the USAO\/TXW. Despite receiving Hernandez's appeal, the OIP never notified him of any decision. \n\nIn response, Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, claiming a violation of the FOIA and the Privacy Act due to their failure to disclose the full extent of the records to which he was entitled. This led to cross-motions for summary judgment being filed by both parties. This court previously held that the withholding of the grand jury transcripts was appropriate, however, it was unclear whether the remaining 18 pages of correspondence and attorney work product were correctly withheld. As a result, the defendants were ordered to submit these documents for in camera review. \n\nHowever, rather than submitting the 18 pages for review, the EOUSA decided to release them to Hernandez. Upon attempting to release these documents, the EOUSA encountered a discrepancy. They could only find 15 pages that had been withheld due to non-responsiveness and could not locate the remaining 3 pages.","In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, a case was underway between two parties: Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., who was the plaintiff, and the U.S. Department of Justice, among others, as the defendants. The case was numbered 15-CV-944 and was presided over by Judge Jia M. Cobb.\n\nIn the legal proceedings, both parties filed for summary judgment. A summary judgment is a definitive ruling by the judge that can end a civil case without a full trial. The defendants' motion for summary judgment was documented in ECF 35, while the plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment was in ECF 38.\n\nAfter meticulous examination of the case and consideration of the reasons elaborated in the accompanying memorandum opinion, the court made its final ruling. It is important to note that a memorandum opinion is a written explanation by the judge stating the reasons for the court's decision.\n\nIn accordance with the stated reasons in the memorandum opinion, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF 35). This effectively meant that the judge deemed the defendants' argument and evidence to be enough to rule in their favor without the need for a full trial. On the other hand, the plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment (ECF 38) was denied. The denial of the plaintiff's motion indicates that the court found their arguments and evidence insufficient to warrant a ruling in their favor without a complete trial.\n\nOnce the ruling was made, the court ordered the Clerk of the Court to terminate the case. The termination of the case signifies the end of all proceedings related to this particular matter in the District Court. The case cannot be revived or brought up again in the same court.\n\nThe order was marked as a final appealable order, which denotes that the order is the final decision from this court, but it can be appealed in a higher court. The parties involved in the case, if dissatisfied with the decision, have the right to request a higher court to review the judgment.\n\nThe final order was delivered and signed by United States District Judge Jia M. Cobb on January 19, 2024. The date of the order is crucial as it often determines the timeline for any potential appeals.\n\nIn summary, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr.'s cross-motion for summary judgment was denied, while the U.S. Department of Justice's motion for summary judgment was granted. The case was terminated with this final order, which could be appealed in a higher court. The order was delivered by Judge Jia M. Cobb on January 19, 2024.","In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the pro se plaintiff Daniel Christmann lodged a case against the District of Columbia and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) in February 2022. He subsequently amended his complaint twice. The charges stem from perceived infringements of his rights in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, assault on the United States Capitol Building.\n\nThe plaintiff's claims, as detailed in his pro se second amended complaint, appear to allege violations of his Fourth Amendment rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He also implicates contraventions of the First Amendment Assemblies Act (FAAA), negligence pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 5-331.07(e)(1), and common law claims of \"malice interference\" and slander. Essentially, the plaintiff aims to deflect responsibility for his criminal behavior on January 6, 2021, onto the District's Mayor and USCP officers, among others. These officials were responsible for maintaining order and protecting the Capitol Building amid an unprecedented violent assault that threatened the safety of many, including the then Vice President of the United States.\n\nCurrently, there are two motions to dismiss the second amended complaint pending before the court. The District has filed one under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), while the USCP has lodged another under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). Alternatively, the USCP seeks a summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Both motions are granted for reasons explained herein.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges that he traveled to Washington, D.C., with a friend to participate in the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021. He departed the rally before former President Trump's speech ended and returned to his car. While in his vehicle in a parking garage, the plaintiff received a call from his brother, who informed him that \"people were just walking into the capitol building, and the police are not doing anything.\" \n\nMotivated by this call, the plaintiff then proceeded to the Capitol Building to \"news gather\" and arrived at approximately 2:48 PM. One minute later, he received an alert on his mobile phone regarding Mayor Bowser's curfew order, demanding everyone to be indoors by 6 PM. According to the plaintiff, everyone lost cellular service due to the mass text sent out simultaneously.\n\nThe plaintiff confesses that he ascended the stairs to the West Terrace to look for his friend and \"news gather\". He also admits to entering the Capitol Building at around 3:00 PM. He describes the scene, stating that many police officers were already present, observing as hordes of protestors flooded the premises. The plaintiff also confesses to entering a side room in an unsuccessful attempt to leave the building. He claims to have avoided any conflicts with the officers and spent a total of fewer than three minutes inside the building, solely filming the events.\n\nThe plaintiff admits to posting videos from the incident on Instagram and acknowledges the severity of the criminal behavior that transpired on the day at the Capitol. He mentions his fear that the government would treat him as a terrorist. The plaintiff does not disclose the date or location of his arrest in his pleadings, but he does describe it as a harsh experience, where he was hit hard in the face with a door.","Citation: 11th Court of Appeals, Eastland, Texas. In Re: Steve Gerdes, No. 11-23-00283-CV, January 18, 2024. Memorandum Opinion by Chief Justice Bailey. Panel: Bailey, C.J., Trotter, J., Williams, J.\n\nThe court conducted a thorough examination of the records in this case, leading to the partial granting of the Relator\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus. In alignment with the court's decision, the petition for writ of mandamus is granted concerning the Ranger city commissioners and denied with respect to Judge David Hullum.\n\nThe Ranger city commissioners, respondents identified as Terry Robinson, Joe Sigler, Kevan Moize, Wendy Erwin, and Samantha McGinnis, are instructed to arrange a special election for the recall of commissioners Moize and McGinnis. This event should be scheduled within a timeframe of not less than fifteen days and not exceeding thirty days from the date of this decision.\n\nThis judgment reflects the court's careful consideration of the documented facts and circumstances of the case, demonstrating the judicial process's fairness and impartiality. It highlights the court's role in interpreting the law and ensuring that justice is served, even if it means overturning or modifying previous decisions.\n\nThe court's decision to grant the petition for writ of mandamus in part signifies the recognition of petitioner's rights under the law, while also underlining the court's commitment to upholding the principle of separation of powers. It underscores the court's authority and responsibility to ensure that government officials, such as the Ranger city commissioners, carry out their duties in accordance with the law.\n\nThe directive to the Ranger city commissioners to schedule a special election within a specified timeframe emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in governance. The recall of commissioners Moize and McGinnis represents the court's intervention to protect the public's right to elect their representatives.\n\nThe denial of the petition for writ of mandamus with respect to Judge David Hullum highlights the court's respect for the independence of the judiciary. It underscores the importance of judicial discretion and the need to avoid undue interference with the judicial process.\n\nIn conclusion, this judgment is a comprehensive interpretation of the law applied to the facts and circumstances of the case. It demonstrates the court's commitment to uphold justice, fairness, and the rule of law. In doing so, it reassures the public of the judiciary's role as the guardian of their rights and freedoms.","In this mandamus proceeding initiated by Steve Gerdes, the Eleventh Court of Appeals No. 11-23-00283-CV dated January 18, 2024, has been asked to instruct the City of Ranger to arrange for a particular recall election for city commissioners Kevan Moize and Samantha McGinnis. Despite having received recall petitions with the requisite number of signatures over 150 days prior, the city did not take any measures to initiate an election. Consequently, we are partially granting the petition for mandamus and instructing the city commissioners to proceed with the recall election.\n\nThe participant of interest, Kevan Moize, contested in the mayoral elections for the City of Ranger in 2023 and was not victorious. Subsequently, he was appointed as a city commissioner for the post he currently serves. On the other hand, Samantha McGinnis, also a participant of interest and city commissioner, had an unopposed candidacy. The city commission annulled her election and without any votes in her favor, she was appointed as commissioner.\n\nOn August 11, 2023, Steve Gerdes, the petitioner, submitted two separate petitions to Somer Lee, the City Secretary of Ranger, seeking the recall of both Moize and McGinnis. Lee, in turn, forwarded the petitions to the commissioners on the same day. The city charter necessitates the commissioners to organize a recall election within a span of 15 to 30 days from the receipt of the petition. However, over five months have passed, and the city has not taken any steps to arrange a recall election.\n\nMandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is only applicable under certain circumstances (Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840, 1992). One of these circumstances includes compelling the enactment of any legal duty related to conducting an election (TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 273.061(a), 2023). Generally, mandamus is applicable where the duty to act is clear, and there is no disputed issue of fact (In re Suson, 120 S.W.3d 477, 478, 2003; Burns v. Kelly, 658 S.W.2d 731, 733, 1983; Blanchard v. Fulbright, 633 S.W.2d 617, 621, 1982). Thus, the key point of contention here is whether the city commissioners of Ranger, who are the respondents in this case, are under a distinct obligation to arrange for a recall election.\n\nThe commissioners contend that they are not obliged to schedule a recall election and provide two reasons for their inaction. Firstly, they claim that their obligation does not exist due to their solitary determination that the petitions are flawed. They indicate that the city charter requires one-fifth of the voters who sign the petition to certify that they voted for the concerned officer in their respective election (RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II, \u00a7 24). They argue that after examining the petitions, they concluded that neither meet the requisite certification threshold. Based on this examination, they have deduced that they are neither permitted nor required by the charter to initiate a recall. However, through this determination that neither Moize nor McGinnis qualifies and, by implication, cannot be valid candidates for recall, they have overstepped their authority.","Citation: \n11th Court of Appeals, Eastland, Texas.

The appellant in these cases was Isaac Jerald Jackson, while the appellee was the State of Texas. This appeal was from the 244th District Court in Ector County, Texas, under the trial court cause Nos. C-22-0520-CR and C-22-0521-CR.\n\nThe appellant, Isaac Jerald Jackson, was found guilty of aggravated robbery, classified as a first-degree felony, and unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon, a third-degree felony, under the Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.03 (West 2019) and \u00a7 46.04 (West Supp. 2023). The jury considered an enhancement allegation as true and decided on an eighty-year imprisonment sentence along with a $7,500 fine for the aggravated robbery offense. For the unlawful possession of a firearm offense, Jackson was given a ten-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine as per \u00a7 12.42(b) of the same Penal Code. The trial court passed the sentence in accordance with these decisions.\n\nJackson pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful firearm possession as a felon but declined guilt on the aggravated robbery charge. During the guilt\/innocence phase of the trial, the State presented five witnesses, including Liying Chen, the owner of the Rose Garden Spa, where Jackson committed the alleged acts on March 21, 2022. Surveillance footage presented to the jury showed Jackson assaulting Chen while demanding money. The State also presented photographs of Chen's injuries, and testimony was given that Jackson's prints were found at the crime scene.\n\nJackson confessed to his state of mind being affected by Xanax during the incident and admitted to assaulting Chen, arguing he was trying to retrieve his money. Jackson was found guilty of both offenses. During the punishment phase, the State presented four witnesses, including two victims of a home burglary Jackson committed in 2012. Jackson testified again and brought forth seven additional witnesses.\n\nJackson\u2019s court-appointed attorney filed a motion to withdraw, stating that there are no arguable issues for appeal. The attorney met all requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); and Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). The records were independently reviewed by the court, which agreed with the attorney that there were no arguable grounds for appeal.\n\nConsequently, the court granted the attorney's motion to withdraw and upheld the trial court's judgment. Justice W. Stacy Trotter delivered the judgment on January 18, 2024. The panel in this case consisted of Bailey, C.J., Trotter, J., and Williams, J. The decision was not meant for publication as per the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 47.2(b).

The court contends that there are no detectable errors or legal missteps in the original judgment passed by the trial court. As such, in alignment with the opinion formed by this court, the ruling handed down by the trial court is hereby upheld in its entirety. \n\nThis decision, rendered in the name of justice, affirms the validity of the judgment delivered in the trial court. The court, thus, finds no basis for overturning or modifying the lower court's verdict.\n","This legal opinion was delivered on January 18, 2024, from the Eleventh Court of Appeals, under case number 11-22-00282-CR. The case on appeal involves appellant, Rodolfo Sanchez, against the State of Texas.\n\nSanchez was initially charged with a third-degree felony for failing to comply with sex offender registration requirements as outlined in Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 62.051 (West Supp. 2023) and article 62.102 (West 2018). As part of a plea agreement on June 16, 2020, the trial court deferred a guilty verdict and instead assigned Sanchez to a five-year deferred adjudication community supervision program, which included adherence to all state and federal laws, court-directed meetings with a supervision officer, and a fine and court costs totaling $1,000.\n\nHowever, the State later submitted a motion to revoke Sanchez's community supervision and adjudicate his guilt, after evidence of his cocaine usage came to light. A hearing on this motion was held on October 10, 2022, during which Sanchez admitted to the drug use and requested the continuation of his community supervision. Despite this, the court established the truth of the State's motion and sentenced Sanchez to eight years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, effectively revoking his community supervision.\n\nSanchez's court-appointed counsel requested to withdraw from representing him in the appeal, citing no arguable issues for appeal after thoroughly examining both the record and applicable law. The counsel fulfilled all requirements by providing Sanchez with necessary documents and information regarding his rights as per Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); and Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\nAlthough given an extension, Sanchez did not present a pro se response to the counsel's Anders brief. Upon independent review of the record following Anders and Schulman procedures, the court agreed with the counsel's assessment that the appeal is meritless. The court noted that proof of a single violation is enough to support the revocation of a probationer's community supervision. In this case, Sanchez's admission of guilt was sufficient to uphold the court's decision. The court, therefore, concurred with the counsel that there were no arguable grounds for appeal.\n\nAs a result, the court granted the counsel's motion to withdraw and confirmed the trial court's ruling. This decision was delivered by Justice W. Stacy Trotter on January 18, 2024, and is not meant for publication as per Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 47.2(b). The panel included Bailey, C.J., Trotter, J., and Williams, J. Sanchez retains the right to file a petition for discretionary review under Rule 68 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.","COURT OF APPEALS, 11TH DISTRICT\nEASTLAND, TEXAS\nFINAL JUDGMENT\n\nRondale Gerrod Farris Vs. The State of Texas\n\nEmerging from the 358th District Court of Ector County,\nTrial Court No. D-18-2005-CR.\n\nCourt File No. 11-22-00086-CR on January 18, 2024\n\nOpinion Memorandum by Judge Williams\nCourt Panel: Bailey, Chief Justice; Williams, Justice; Wright, Senior Chief Justice, appointed.\nJustice Trotter was not participating.\n\nThe court has undertaken a thorough examination of the record pertaining to this matter and has determined that there exists an error in one of the lower court's judgments. Hence, in line with this court's opinion, we are led to annul Appellant's felony murder conviction on the grounds that it contravenes the Double Jeopardy Clause. Additionally, we overturn the trial court's judgment concerning Count Two and instead, issue a judgment of acquittal pertaining to this count. Conversely, regarding Count One and Count Three, we uphold the previous judgments made by the trial court.","Case Overview:\n\nThe case in question involves the appellant, Rondale Gerrod Farris, and the appellee, the State of Texas. This appeal was lodged in the Eleventh Court of Appeals, under the case number 11-22-00086-CR, following the trial in the 358th District Court of Ector County, Texas, with case number D-18-2005-CR. \n\nThe appellant was initially indicted in 2018 and later re-indicted in 2021. The jury found the appellant guilty of murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal activity as per the crimes outlined in sections 19.02 and 71.02 of the Texas Penal Code (West Supplement, 2023). The consequent punishment was a 65-year, 50-year, and 20-year sentence in the Correctional Institutions Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, with sentences to be served concurrently.\n\nGrounds of Appeal:\n\nThe appellant raised four issues on appeal. Firstly, the appellant argued that the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution was violated due to convictions for both murder and felony murder. Secondly, the appellant disputed the sufficiency of evidence supporting the convictions for murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal activity. Thirdly, the appellant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Lastly, the appellant contended that admittance of evidence regarding gang tattoos, not belonging to him, was a fault on the trial court's part.\n\nFacts and Legal Proceedings:\n\nThe relevant incident occurred at around 2:00 A.M. on July 13, 2018, when the Odessa Police Department (OPD) received information about a gunshot victim near an Odessa convenience store. The victim, Treginale White, was found alive but later succumbed to the gunshot wounds, and his death was ruled as homicide.\n\nSergeant Justin Caid, an OPD detective from the robbery\/homicide unit of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), started his investigation of the shooting at around 3:15 A.M. He located evidence such as blood traces, bullet defects in a vehicle associated with the victim, discharged .40 caliber firearm shells, and fragments of projectile jacketing. Multiple witness interviews were conducted, one of whom stated to have seen the appellant shoot the victim.\n\nInvestigative officers obtained surveillance footage from the convenience store, which showed the appellant running towards the victim with raised arms, firing four gunshots, and subsequently fleeing the scene. The appellant's behavior suggested he was carrying a firearm tucked into his waistband, corroborated by the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, who confirmed his habit of carrying a firearm in this manner.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe jury's examination of the aforementioned evidence and testimonies led to the conviction of the appellant for murder, felony murder, and participation in organized criminal activity. The appeal has partly been affirmed and partly vacated. The court's decision signifies that the convictions align with legal standards and that the evidence was sufficient to support them. However, some issues raised in the appeal may require further consideration.\n","Citation:\n\nSalinas, T. v. The State of Texas, No. 11-22-00319-CR, 11th Court of Appeals, Eastland, Texas (January 18, 2024). \n\nIn this case, the court of appeal, after meticulous examination of the case records, identified an error in the lower court's ruling. Consequently, aligned with the appellate court's judgement, the lower court's decision was altered by eliminating the reimbursement fees. Subject to this modification, the lower court's judgement was upheld. The panel presiding over this matter included Bailey, C.J., Trotter, J., and Williams, J. The case was initially heard in the 106th District Court of Dawson County, bearing the trial court number 21-8455.

On August 18, 2021, the trial court opted for deferred adjudication and did not pronounce a guilty verdict. Salinas was then placed under community supervision for a four-year period. His community supervision conditions required him to abide by all state and federal laws, report to his community supervision officer, and pay a $100 fine, court costs, and $600 in reimbursement fees.\n\nFollowing this, the State filed an application to adjudicate guilt, alleging that Salinas had violated eight conditions of his community supervision. A hearing regarding this application was held on October 24, 2022. The State presented evidence supporting their allegations, while Salinas admitted that the allegations were partially true. The trial court found Salinas guilty of breaching his supervision conditions, thus revoking his community supervision, adjudicating him guilty, and sentencing him to twenty years of confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\nIn this appeal, Salinas' court-appointed counsel has submitted a motion for withdrawal. Supporting this motion is a brief in which the counsel, after reviewing and professionally examining the record and the applicable law, concludes that there are no defensible issues to present on appeal. The counsel furnished Salinas with copies of the brief, the withdrawal motion, an explanatory letter, as well as the clerk\u2019s record and the reporter\u2019s record. They informed Salinas of his rights to review the record, respond to the brief, and file a petition for discretionary review as per Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 68. The court-appointed counsel is in compliance with the stipulations of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); and Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\nSalinas subsequently filed a self-represented response to his counsel\u2019s Anders brief, in which he requested the appointment of a new attorney for the appeal. He, however, did not address the case's merits. Following Anders and Schulman's procedures, we independently examined the record and agreed with the counsel's conclusion that there are no defensible grounds for appeal.\n\nNevertheless, the judgment adjudicating Salinas guilty requires him to pay $600 in reimbursement fees for court-appointed counsel, an order initially made when he was placed on deferred adjudication. While the initial order deferring adjudication of guilt found Salinas to have the financial resources to pay the said reimbursement fees, the final judgment adjudicating him guilty does not include a similar finding.\n\nThe record reveals that Salinas was deemed indigent prior to the revocation hearing. According to Article 26.05(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court shall order the reimbursement of court-appointed attorney fees only if it determines that the defendant has the financial resources to pay part or all of the costs of legal services, including expenses and costs (Texas Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 26.05(g) West Supp. 2023).\n\nGiven that the record does not indicate that the trial court, upon reordering the payment of reimbursement fees, ascertained that Salinas possessed the financial resources or capability to pay the appointed attorney\u2019s fees, the court committed an error by assessing those fees. Cates v. State, 402 S.W.3d 250, 252 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) ruled that the judgment should be modified to omit the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of a record finding that an indigent defendant could repay the costs of court-appointed counsel. Consequently, we adjust the judgment to exclude the reimbursement fees.\n\nWe, therefore, grant the counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and affirm the trial court's judgment.","The following citation pertains to a court document electronically filed in the Supreme Court under the case number SCWC-XX-XXXXXXX on January 19, 2024, at 1:40 PM and documented as Dkt. 5 ODSAC. The court case involves US Bank National Association, who is acting as a trustee for Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust Inc., Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series 2005-11, in the capacity of a respondent and plaintiff-appellee. The petitioners and defendants-appellants in the case are Howard E. Greenberg and Denise C. Greenberg. Additional respondents and defendants-appellees in the case are Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Ke Ali'i Kai Association, Inc.\n\nThis case has been elevated to the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai'i through certiorari, from the Intermediate Court of Appeals, and is identified with the civil number 16-1-0554(1). The application for writ of certiorari has been dismissed, as stated in an order released by the Supreme Court. The reason for the dismissal is cited to be that the judgment on appeal in this matter has not been filed by the Intermediate Court of Appeals at the time when the application for a writ of certiorari was filed, as stipulated by Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7 602-59(a) (2017) and Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 36(b)(1) (2016).\n\nThe dismissal of the application for writ of certiorari was filed on December 15, 2023. The order was sanctioned in Honolulu, Hawai'i, on January 19, 2024, by the following judges: Mark E. Recktenwald, Sabrina S. McKenna, Todd W. Eddins, Lisa M. Ginoza, and Vladimir P. Devens. Their approval is indicated by their respective signatures on the order.","In the case number 22-50583, Larry R. Steele, a Texas prisoner (#01864228), filed an appeal against the dismissal of his civil rights action. This case was brought to the attention of the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, on January 19, 2024. Steele sought permission to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal, challenging the district court's certification that the appeal is not in good faith. \n\nThe defendants in this case include the United States Postal Service (USPS), the State of Texas, the United States, Bryan Collier (Executive Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice), and Bobby Lumpkin (Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division). Judges Clement, Engelhardt, and Ramirez presided over the case.\n\nSteele's claims against the USPS, the United States, and the State of Texas were dismissed by the district court, which concluded that these defendants were immune from legal action. Steele argued that the USPS had lost its status as a governmental entity and should therefore not be afforded sovereign immunity. However, this claim was found to be incorrect based on the ruling in Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 U.S. 481, 484 (2006).\n\nDespite Steele's assertion of federal question jurisdiction against the USPS and the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, it was ruled that this does not negate the potential for sovereign immunity unless there is a statute waiving such immunity. Relevant case law includes Elldakli v. Garland, 64 F.4th 666, 670 (5th Cir.), and the cert. denied, No. 23-115, 2023 WL 8531894 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, Steele's assertion that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Administrative Procedures Act may waive sovereign immunity in certain situations was determined to be inapplicable in this case, as per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 and McAfee v. 5th Cir. Judges, 884 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\nSteele's argument that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar lawsuits against the State of Texas because he was alleging that the defendant was acting contrary to federal law was also found to be incorrect, according to Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 339-40 (1979).\n\nIn regard to the individual defendants, officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), Steele did not contest the district court's dismissal of the claims against them in their official capacities. Consequently, any arguments related to this were considered abandoned, as noted in Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, 813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\nSteele claimed that the individual defendants violated his rights of access to the courts under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as TDCJ prisoners are only permitted to send legal mail to the courts via USPS. He argued that due to undue delays in the postal system and the existence of third-party delivery services, prisoners should be allowed to use alternative means to deliver legal mail. However, Steele failed to demonstrate that the exclusive use of USPS prevents prisoners from having a reasonably adequate opportunity to challenge their convictions or the conditions of their confinement.","United States Court of Appeals, \nFifth Circuit, \nCase No. 22-10783\nFiling Date: January 19, 2024\nClerk: Lyle W. Cayce\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant\/Cross-Appellee: Marcus Traylor\n\nDefendant-Appellee\/Cross-Appellant: Gideon Yorka\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, \nUSDC No. 3:21-CV-406\n\nPanel: Richman, Chief Judge, and Haynes and Duncan, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion by: Per Curiam\n\nCase Summary:\n\nFollowing an incident at a Dallas bar, Officer Gideon Yorka was accused by Marcus Traylor of striking him in the face and wrongfully arresting him. Traylor subsequently filed claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for excessive use of force, unlawful arrest, and fabrication of evidence. The District Court granted qualified immunity to Officer Yorka for the excessive force and unlawful arrest claims, but denied immunity for the fabrication-of-evidence claim. After considering the details of the case, this Court has decided to uphold part of the District Court's decision and reverse another part for reasons explained below.\n\nCase Background:\n\nOn the night of February 16, 2020, Marcus Traylor and three of his friends visited the Clutch Bar and Restaurant in Dallas, Texas. On the same evening, Dallas Police Department Officer Gideon Yorka and another officer were acting as private security at the bar while off duty and in full uniform.\n\nDuring their time at the bar, Traylor\u2019s group ordered bottle service that included a bottle of champagne and two bottles of hard liquor. Traylor claims to have consumed two or three glasses of champagne over an hour. At some point, the bar's security asked the group to leave due to one of Traylor's friends falling asleep. Traylor reportedly lingered to settle his bill, leading a bouncer to physically remove him from the premises.\n\nOfficer Yorka was outside during this altercation but was informed by Clutch's security about an altercation inside and was asked to assist. Yorka and his colleague then entered the bar where they found Traylor being restrained on the floor by Clutch security with a bloodied mouth. Yorka then escorted Traylor out of the bar, during which he noticed a smell of alcohol on Traylor's breath.\n\nThe events that transpired outside Clutch Bar are disputed by the parties. According to Traylor, he was cooperative as Yorka guided him out of the bar and into the street. Yorka instructed Traylor to leave, but Traylor insisted that his belongings, including his wallet, were still inside the bar. Traylor then walked towards the curb to seek assistance from a security guard or another person to retrieve his belongings. As he approached the curb, Yorka allegedly struck him in the face, causing him to fall.\n\nYorka, however, tells a different story. He alleges that Traylor was uncooperative as he was being escorted out of the bar, repeatedly trying to turn around and go back inside. Yorka asserts that he was able to maintain control of the situation despite Traylor's actions.","The following is an analysis of a court case with the document number 00517038944, filed on January 19, 2024, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

Christopher Robin Ledean\n\nORDER SUMMARY:\n\nThis case document presents an order issued by the Supreme Court of the State of Montana on January 19, 2024, in relation to case number DA 23-0127. The parties involved in the case are the State of Montana, serving as the plaintiff and appellee, and Christopher Robin Ledean, serving as the defendant and appellant.\n\nThe matter at hand pertains to an application made by the appellant for an extension of time. The nature of the motion suggests that the appellant requested additional time to prepare, file, and serve their opening brief on appeal. This request was necessitated by unspecified reasons contributing to the appellant's inability to meet the original deadline.\n\nUpon review, the court found merit in the appellant's request. In legal parlance, this is often denoted by the phrase \"good cause appearing\". This suggests that the appellant provided satisfactory reasons justifying their need for an extension, and the court concurred with their assertions.\n\nIn light of the above, the court, represented by Chief Justice Mike McGrath, granted the appellant's motion. As per the order, the appellant was given an extension until March 4, 2024, to carry out the aforementioned tasks related to their appeal. Namely, to prepare their argument, formally submit it to the court (file), and ensure that the opposing party is informed of the submitted argument (serve).

This particular case exhibits such a scenario where the Defendant-Appellant, Keith Charles Harrison, has tabled a motion seeking an extension of time for the preparation, filing, and service of the opening brief on appeal.\n\nSuch requests are not uncommon in the field of law, as the process of preparing and crafting a compelling brief requires a thorough review of the lower court proceedings, research into relevant legal precedents, and the construction of cogent arguments to persuade the appellate court. Often, legal practitioners are simultaneously managing multiple cases, causing potential time constraints which could compromise the quality and comprehensiveness of the brief.\n\nIn response to Mr. Harrison's request, the Chief Justice, Mike McGrath, has granted the extension until February 26, 2024. The court acknowledges that providing adequate time for the preparation, submission, and service of the opening brief on appeal is fundamental to the principles of due process, and ensures that both parties in the dispute have an equal and fair opportunity to present their case.\n\nThis order demonstrates the court\u2019s commitment to upholding the rights of both parties in the legal dispute, ensuring that neither party is disadvantaged due to time constraints or other procedural limitations. It is a reflection of the court's understanding and recognition of the complexities involved in crafting a comprehensive and persuasive brief on appeal.\n\nWhile the court strives to expedite proceedings for the benefit of all parties involved, it recognizes that the pursuit of justice should not be rushed. In the preparation and presentation of legal arguments, time is a crucial factor that can significantly impact the efficacy and thoroughness of an appellant's case.\n\nThe decision to grant an extension of time, however, is not taken lightly by the court. It is a balancing act between ensuring timely justice and providing parties with adequate opportunity to prepare their case. In this instance, the court has deemed that good cause exists to grant the extension, and in doing so, seeks to maintain fairness and impartiality in its proceedings.\n\nIn conclusion, the court's order signifies its commitment to equal justice, ensuring that all parties are granted sufficient time to prepare and present their case.

The circuit court erred by sentencing the defendant as a Class\n             X offender, so the cause is remanded to the circuit court to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b62     On September 27, 2016, the State charged by information the defendant-appellant, Albert\n\nSmith, with three counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated\n\nbattery with a deadly weapon. On August 6, 2019, the circuit court conducted a jury trial of Mr.\n\nSmith on the aforementioned charges. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Mr. Smith\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nguilty of aggravated battery of a peace officer, and he was sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. On\n\nappeal, Mr. Smith argues that: (1) he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel for failing\n\nto provide an expert on cross-racial identification; (2) there was plain error committed during the\n\nState\u2019s closing arguments; and (3) the trial court erred by sentencing him as a Class X offender.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction and remand the cause to the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b63                                        BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On September 27, 2016, the State charged Mr. Smith by information with three counts of\n\naggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nMr. Smith elected to proceed via a jury trial on the charges. On August 6, 2019, the trial court\n\nconducted a jury trial. During the trial, the State called two primary occurrence witnesses: Chicago\n\nPolice Department Officer Terrence Pratcher and Chicago Police Department Officer Anthony\n\nRosen.\n\n\u00b65       Officer Pratcher testified that at the time of the trial, he had been working for the Chicago\n\nPolice Department for approximately 12 years. On May 26, 2016, Officer Pratcher was patrolling\n\nwith Officer Rosen and Officer Rick Caballero in an unmarked Ford Explorer when they were\n\napproached by their confidential informant about a black man selling drugs in a tan Cadillac,\n\nbearing partial license plate number \u201cE30\u201d on the 1600 block of Homan Avenue. At the time, the\n\nofficers were in plainclothes, which was a bulletproof vest with a police star, either on a chain or\n\nembroidered on their bulletproof vests. Though defense counsel objected to the admission of the\n\nstatement of the confidential informant, it was allowed for the limited purpose of the officers\u2019\n\nsubsequent actions. Officer Pratcher and his partners relocated to the area referenced by the\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nconfidential informant but did not see the vehicle. As a result, they drove around the area for about\n\n10 minutes looking for the car. About an hour later, while traveling southbound on Homan Avenue\n\nfrom 16th Street, they saw a parked car matching the description including the partial license plate,\n\n\u201cE30.\u201d When they drove past the vehicle and slowed down to make a U-turn, the black man they\n\nsaw in the driver seat of the vehicle drove away onto 16th Street. The officers followed slowly\n\nbehind the vehicle hoping it would stop but eventually lost sight of the vehicle. Then, they saw the\n\nvehicle parked around 3342 West Odgen and they parked next to the vehicle. All the officers exited\n\nthe vehicle, and Officer Pratcher went to the driver\u2019s side window, where he saw Mr. Smith, whom\n\nhe identified in court. Officer Pratcher knocked on the window and tried to get Mr. Smith to roll\n\ndown his window but Mr. Smith shook his head, \u201cno.\u201d Officer Pratcher then asked Mr. Smith to\n\nstep out of the vehicle and he again declined to do that. Instead, Mr. Smith started the car, shifted\n\nthe car into drive, and then turned the car in the direction of Officer Pratcher. Before Officer\n\nPratcher could move out of the way, the tan Cadillac quickly accelerated and hit him on his right\n\nleg. He ended up on the hood of the vehicle for about 10 feet, while the car traveled westbound on\n\nOgden, before falling off the hood. The other officers tried to run after the vehicle, which kept\n\ngoing, and then they checked on Officer Pratcher. Then, Officer Pratcher and his fellow officers\n\nentered their squad car, called dispatch about the description of the tan Cadillac, and drove around\n\nattempting to locate the Cadillac. Other officers found the car abandoned in a vacant lot.\n\n\u00b66     At the police station, about 30 minutes after Officer Pratcher was struck by the car, Officer\n\nRosen showed him a photograph, which he identified as the man who drove into him, Mr. Smith.\n\nOfficer Pratcher then went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with \u201cbruising and soft tissue\n\ndamage to [his] right leg.\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph was added to the wanted board for Officer\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nPratcher\u2019s police district. On cross-examination, he conceded that he did not view a photo array or\n\na lineup in this case.\n\n\u00b67      Officer Rosen testified to the same details that Officer Pratcher stated on his direct\n\nexamination, mainly the circumstances leading to the encounter with Mr. Smith, their attire that\n\nday, and also how Officer Pratcher was injured. He added the detail that when they approached\n\nthe parked car, before exiting the vehicle, he observed Mr. Smith was reclined all the way back in\n\nthe driver\u2019s seat of the tan Cadillac. He identified Mr. Smith in court. He looked up the license\n\nplate of the tan Cadillac in the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s database and received Mr. Smith\u2019s name\n\nand information. With that information, he pulled up Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph and confirmed he\n\nwas the driver of the tan Cadillac \u201cwhen it struck Officer Pratcher.\u201d\n\n\u00b68      After the close of the trial evidence, the jury found Mr. Smith guilty of aggravated battery\n\nto a peace officer and not guilty on the count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. On\n\nAugust 27, 2019, the trial court sentenced him to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The court found he was\n\nClass X eligible because of prior felony convictions. Mr. Smith mailed his notice of appeal to the\n\ncircuit court in a letter postmarked September 24, 2019.\n\n\u00b69                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10    We note that we have jurisdiction to consider this matter, as Mr. Smith filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 606 (eff. July 1, 2017); see also People v. English, 2023 IL\n\n128077, \u00b6 25.\n\n\u00b6 11    Mr. Smith argues that: (1) his trial counsel offered ineffective assistance of counsel when\n\ncounsel failed to call a cross-racial identification expert; (2) the State made improper comments\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nduring closing arguments; (3) the trial court erred by sentencing Mr. Smith as a Class X offender\n\nsince one of his predicate felonies was committed when he was a minor.\n\n\u00b6 12   To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ca defendant must show both\n\nthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n\ndefendant.\u201d People v. Petrenko, 237 Ill. 2d 490, 496 (2010). To establish deficient performance, a\n\ndefendant must show his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 219 (2004) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).\n\n\u201cEffective assistance of counsel refers to competent, not perfect representation.\u201d Evans, 209 Ill.\n\n2d at 219 (quoting People v. Stewart, 104 Ill. 2d 463, 491-92 (1984)). Mistakes in trial strategy or\n\ntactics do not necessarily render counsel\u2019s representation defective. See People v. Hayes, 2021 IL\n\nApp (1st) 172417, \u00b6 78 (finding that the decision to not file a motion to suppress is typically a\n\nmatter of trial strategy, in which courts of review give great deference to counsel\u2019s decision).\n\n\u00b6 13   To establish the second prong of Strickland, prejudice, a defendant must show that \u201cbut for\n\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different.\u201d People v. Houston, 229 Ill. 2d 1, 4 (2008). \u201cTo establish prejudice in\n\nthe guilty plea context, \u2018the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPeople v. Valdez, 2016 IL 119860, \u00b6 29 (quoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985)). \u201cA\n\ndefendant must satisfy both prongs of the Strickland test and a failure to satisfy any one of the\n\nprongs precludes a finding of ineffectiveness.\u201d People v. Simpson, 2015 IL 116512, \u00b6 35.\n\nSpeculation as to what an expert witness will say is insufficient to prove the prejudice prong of a\n\nStrickland analysis. People v. Elliot, 2022 IL App (1st) 192294, \u00b6 49.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 14   During closing arguments, defense counsel for the first time attempted to argue that cross-\n\nracial identifications are \u201cdifferent\u201d and that the opportunity for Officer Pratcher to view Mr. Smith\n\nwas short, calling it a \u201cquick encounter.\u201d The State promptly objected, and the objection was\n\nsustained. Based on this exchange, Mr. Smith argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel for arguing an unsupported defense theory. Our caselaw is clear, however,\n\nthat a defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong of the Strickland test for failing to call an expert\n\nwitness based solely on speculation as what a potential witness would have said. Elliot, 2022 IL\n\nApp (1st) 192294, \u00b6 49; People v. Bauer, 393 Ill. App. 3d 414, 424 (2009). Moreover, the officers\u2019\n\nidentification was not the only evidence linking Mr. Smith to the vehicle since the tan Cadillac\n\nthat was stopped was registered to Mr. Smith. While the vehicle ownership alone was not a\n\nsufficient basis for an identification, the vehicle registration, in addition to the interaction with\n\ndefendant, made it unlikely that this was a case of misidentification due to cross-racial\n\nidentification. As a result, we fail to find that Mr. Smith can meet the prejudice prong and find that\n\ncounsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 15   Mr. Smith next argues that the State made improper closing arguments, which admitted\n\nhearsay evidence for an improper purpose and shifted the burden of proof. Mr. Smith did not object\n\nto any of the alleged improper closing arguments, therefore forfeited that argument. People v.\n\nHillier, 237 Ill. 2d 539, 544 (2010). However, we review whether it falls under the plain error\n\nexception to the forfeiture rule.\n\n\u00b6 16   An exception to the forfeiture rule exists in situations where the alleged error rises to the\n\nlevel of plain error. People v. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. Illinois Supreme Court\n\nRule 615(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 1967) provides that \u201csubstantial or what have become known as plain\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nerrors may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.) People v. Sebby, 2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 48. Under the plain error doctrine,\n\na reviewing court may consider forfeited errors if the evidence was closely balanced or \u201cthe error\n\nwas so egregious that [the] defendant was deprived of a substantial right and thus a fair trial.\u201d\n\nRoman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. First, a defendant must prove there was a clear or obvious\n\nerror. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. The burden of persuasion rests with the defendant,\n\nand the first step is to determine whether any error occurred. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st)\n\n102853, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 17   The State is afforded wide latitude in closing arguments. People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92,\n\n123 (2007). The State may argue to the jury, facts, and reasonable inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence. People v. Terry, 312 Ill. App. 3d 984, 993 (2000). In reviewing remarks made during\n\nclosing arguments, this court asks whether the remarks created a substantial prejudice against the\n\ndefendant such that it is impossible to say whether or not a guilty verdict resulted from the remarks.\n\nWheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92 at 123. Statements must be considered in the context of closing arguments\n\nas a whole, and the State can reasonably respond in rebuttal to the defense\u2019s characterizations of\n\nthe evidence or case. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 225 (2004). If the jury could have reached\n\na contrary verdict had the improper remarks not been made, or if this court cannot say that the\n\nState\u2019s improper remarks did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction, a new trial should be\n\ngranted. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92 at 123.\n\n\u00b6 18   The first remark argued by Mr. Smith was that Mr. Smith\u2019s \u201cactions of choosing to be\n\nuncooperative show that he knows exactly who he is dealing with.\u201d Mr. Smith argues that these\n\nstatements were meaningless unless the State asked the jury to take the hearsay evidence for the\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\ntruth of the matter asserted. We do not share that sentiment.\n\n\u00b6 19   The thrust of Mr. Smith\u2019s trial counsel argument was that Mr. Smith did not know it was\n\nofficers who were trying to initiate contact with Mr. Smith on the date of the incident. However,\n\nthat contention was belied by the trial evidence, which was exemplified in the State\u2019s closing\n\nargument. When Mr. Smith spotted the officers turning in his direction, he drove away and when\n\nthey followed him, he kept driving until he successfully evaded them. Then, according to Officer\n\nRosen, he reclined his seat all the way back, in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid being seen.\n\nWhen Officer Pratcher knocked on Mr. Smith\u2019s window and asked him to lower his window, Mr.\n\nSmith shook his head to indicate a denial of the request. All of those actions, primarily evading\n\nthe officers while driving and reclining his seat, show that he knew he was dealing with police\n\nofficers. The State\u2019s remarks did not ask the jury to consider inadmissible hearsay about the\n\nofficers\u2019 initial interest in Mr. Smith. Rather, following suit of defense counsel, the State argued\n\nthe trial evidence in a persuasive way to fit its narrative of the events. Additionally, both the State\n\nand the trial court admonished the jury, that while the State would make an argument, only the\n\ntrial court could instruct the jury about the law. There was nothing impermissible about the State\u2019s\n\nargument.\n\n\u00b6 20   The next portion of the closing, which Mr. Smith argued was improper, stated:\n\n       \u201cCounsel talks about beyond a reasonable doubt beyond a reasonable doubt. It\u2019s not any\n\n       doubt whatsoever. It\u2019s not a doubt that you can make up. It\u2019s not a doubt that you want to\n\n       make up. I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. It\u2019s a reasonable doubt. Is it reasonable that those\n\n       two officers got together and decided let\u2019s put it on this guy. You saw them right there,\n\n       those two officers. They put this on this guy. Is that reasonable?\u201d\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 21   Mr. Smith cites People v. Wilson, 199 Ill. App. 3d 792 (1990) for the proposition that the\n\nState cannot discuss the credibility of its witnesses when discussing its burden of proof. The case,\n\nhowever, does not stand for that position. In the Wilson case, 199 Ill. App. 3d at 796, the prosecutor\n\nargued that his position involves an obligation and a duty to only prosecute guilty people and\n\ndismiss charges against innocent people. This clearly was a way to bolster the trial evidence based\n\nsolely on his position of public trust rather than the evidence. That is not what the State did here.\n\nHere, the State argued that if the officers\u2019 statements are believed, it has met its burden of proof\n\nbut the only way for it not to meet its burden is to suggest that all of the witnesses were liars or, as\n\nMr. Smith suggested on appeal, mistaken. While the State could have been more precise in its\n\nlanguage and questioned whether it was reasonable that both officers were mistaken in their\n\nidentification of Mr. Smith, that was not an improper argument error which shifted the burden of\n\nproof to Mr. Smith. Since we found that there was no error, in regard to the closing arguments,\n\nthere can be no plain error. People v. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19 (stating the first step\n\nin a plain error analysis is to determine if any error occurred).\n\n\u00b6 22   Mr. Smith\u2019s last argument revolved around his sentencing. He argued that the trial court\n\nerred by sentencing him as a Class X offender based on his prior felonies including a juvenile\n\nconviction which he states could not be used as a predicate for the enhancement. The State\n\nresponded by arguing that the issue is moot since Mr. Smith has completed his sentence including\n\nhis mandatory supervised release (MSR).\n\n\u00b6 23   An issue on appeal becomes moot when events occurring after the appeal render it\n\nimpossible for the reviewing court to grant effective relief. In re Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d 348,\n\n358-59 (2005). Generally, courts of review do not handle moot issues. Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n348 at 359. However, while the completion of a defendant\u2019s sentence renders a challenge to the\n\nsentence moot, a challenge to the conviction is not. Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d 348 at 359.\n\n\u00b6 24   Here, Mr. Smith challenges only his sentence, which he has completed, and not his\n\nconviction. Mr. Smith correctly argues that the Class X sentence would have future repercussions\n\non his sentence if he is convicted of a crime in the future. As a result, we find the issue is not moot\n\nand review the matter on the merits.\n\n\u00b6 25   In People v. Stewart, 2022 IL 126116, \u00b6 22, our supreme court found that juvenile offenses\n\ndo not qualify as a predicate offense under section 5-4.5-95 of the Uniform Code of Corrections\n\n(730 ILCS 5\/5-4.5-95 (West 2016)), which qualifies a defendant as subject to mandatory Class X\n\nsentencing if he or she has two prior felony convictions. In this case, the trial court found that Mr.\n\nSmith was subject to mandatory Class X sentencing due in part to a 1996 juvenile conviction for\n\na drug offense. Since his juvenile offense could not be considered as a predicate offense, we find\n\nthat the trial court erred in its imposition of his sentence. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith has completed\n\nhis term of imprisonment and mandatory supervised release. Nonetheless, we direct the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus to reflect a Class 2 sentencing for Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for\n\naggravated battery of a peace officer (720 ILCS 5\/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2016)). 720 ILCS 5\/12-\n\n3.05(h) (West 2016) (\u201cAggravated battery as defined in subdivision (a)(4), (d)(4), or (g)(3) is a\n\nClass 2 felony\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 26                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 27   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery to a\n\npeace officer and remand the cause to the circuit court of Cook County for the limited purpose of\n\ncorrecting the mittimus.\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 28   Affirmed in part; remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 11 -\n\f","                                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n\n\n    ESPIGMENIO HERNADEZ, JR.,\n\n                             Plaintiff,                        Case No. 15-CV-944 (JMC)\n\n                             v.\n\n    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al.,\n\n                             Defendants.\n\n                                          MEMORANDUM OPINION\n         Plaintiff Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., proceeding pro se, filed suit against the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA)\n\n(collectively, Defendants) seeking records related to his prosecution by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\n\nfor the Western District of Texas. Hernandez brings his civil action under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. For the\n\nreasons below, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and\n\nDENIES Hernandez\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38. 1\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         Hernandez was prosecuted in the Western District of Texas for possession with the intent\n\nto distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. W.D. Tex. 4:11-\n\ncr-442 (Tex.) ECF 16. He was found guilty and is incarcerated at the Fort Worth Federal\n\nCorrectional Institution. Tex. ECF 94 at 1; see ECF 52 at 3. On February 5, 2014, Hernandez sent\n\n\n\n1\n  Unless otherwise indicated, the formatting of quoted materials has been modified throughout this opinion, for\nexample, by omitting internal quotation marks and citations, and by incorporating emphases, changes to capitalization,\nand other bracketed alterations therein. All pincites to documents filed on the docket are to the automatically generated\nECF Page ID number that appears at the top of each page.\n\n                                                           1\n\fa letter to the EOUSA \u201crequesting access to any records about me\u201d maintained by the EOUSA,\n\nciting FOIA and the Privacy Act. ECF 13-3 at 10. The Office passed Hernandez\u2019s letter on to the\n\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO\/TXW). Id. at 3.\n\n       A paralegal with the USAO\/TXW was responsible for locating records potentially\n\nresponsive to Hernandez\u2019s request. In a form attached to a letter sent from the EOUSA to\n\nHernandez, the paralegal indicated that she had located 459 pages of potentially responsive\n\ndocuments: 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of\n\ncorrespondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (DEA). ECF 15 at 18\u201321. She determined that the public records and grand\n\njury transcripts were non-releasable, but she sent the remaining pages of correspondence, attorney\n\nwork product, and DEA documents to the EOUSA. ECF 15 at 21; ECF 19-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20136. By her count,\n\nshe sent 38 pages. ECF 19-1 \u00b6 5. The EOUSA then transferred the 8 pages of DEA documents\n\nback to the DEA, id., leaving 30 pages consisting of correspondence and attorney work-product,\n\nECF 19 at 3\u20134. The EOUSA determined that only 12 of those pages were responsive. Id.\n\n       As to the 12 pages deemed responsive to his request, the EOUSA notified Hernandez that\n\nthe office was fully releasing 4 pages, partially releasing 1 page, and fully withholding 7 pages\n\nbased on FOIA exemptions. ECF 15 at 14\u201315. Hernandez administratively appealed the EOUSA\u2019s\n\ndetermination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). Id. at 24. Citing the USAO\/TXW\u2019s\n\nform, Hernandez sought production of the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work\n\nproduct that the USAO\/TXW had located. Id. Although OIP received Hernandez\u2019s filing, ECF 13-\n\n3 at 20, the office never notified him of any decision on his timely appeal, ECF 1 \u00b6 16.\n\n       Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, alleging that Defendants violated FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act by failing to produce all records to which he is entitled. ECF 1 \u00b6 11. The Parties\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fthereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF 13; ECF 15. In partially resolving these\n\nmotions, this Court held that the grand jury transcripts were properly withheld, but the Court could\n\nnot determine whether the 18 pages of purportedly nonresponsive correspondence and attorney\n\nwork product were appropriately withheld by the EOUSA. ECF 25 at 13, 15. So, Defendants were\n\nordered to submit those 18 pages for in camera review. Id. at 17. Rather than submit the 18 pages\n\nto the Court for in camera review, however, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and\n\nopted to release the 18 pages to Hernandez. ECF 26 at 1.\n\n       The EOUSA immediately faced a problem when releasing these previously withheld\n\ndocuments. In searching for the key \u201c18 pages,\u201d the EOUSA could find \u201conly 15 pages that were\n\nwithheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\u201d and was \u201cunable to determine why it previously\n\nbelieved that it had withheld 18 pages.\u201d ECF 26 at 1. But \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the EOUSA released\n\nthose 15 pages in full. Id. Hernandez took issue with this supplemental production. He argued that\n\nthe EOUSA provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201c18 pages\u201d initially withheld\n\nand the 15 pages eventually produced, and further protested that these documents \u201cfeatured no\n\ncorrespondence or attorney work product\u201d as the EOUSA claimed. ECF 27 at 2\u20133. To\n\n\u201cinvestigat[e] the alleged discrepancy,\u201d the EOUSA indicated that it would reprocess the\n\nresponsive documents, ECF 28 at 1; ECF 29 at 1, and the Parties moved for summary judgment\n\nshortly thereafter, ECF 35; ECF 38.\n\n       After the EOUSA reprocessed the records, there was still one page unaccounted for.\n\nDefendants assert that when the EOUSA initially requested responsive documents from the\n\nUSAO\/TXW, it had received only 37 pages\u2014not 38 pages, as listed on the initial form. ECF 35-\n\n2 at 2. Defendants dismiss this discrepancy as a \u201ctypographical error\u201d or a potentially \u201clost\u201d page.\n\nId. Defendants further represent that, when the EOUSA requested responsive records a second\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftime for the purpose of reprocessing, the USAO\/TXW once again transferred 37 pages. ECF 35-1\n\nat 4\u20135. Excepting the 8 pages transferred to the DEA, the entire set of 29 pages were released to\n\nHernandez (16 pages in full, 13 pages in part). ECF 35-1 at 5; ECF 35-2 at 7\u20138. With this\n\nreprocessing and release completed, Defendants assert that they have adequately searched for\n\nrecords responsive to Hernandez\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he is\n\nentitled. ECF 35-1 at 3.\n\n        In his cross motion, Hernandez does not contest the adequacy of the search that the EOUSA\n\nconducted during reprocessing, nor does he dispute the bases for the office\u2019s partial withholding\n\nof 13 pages under FOIA exemptions. He only takes issue with the gap between the number of\n\ndocuments that the EOUSA initially deemed to be unresponsive (18) and the number that the\n\nOffice later released to him (15) before it decided to reprocess the entire batch of documents.\n\nECF 38 at 4\u20136. Hernandez asks this Court to \u201center summary judgment in [his] favor and order\n\nthat the Defendant surrender the original 18-pages or provide a cogent sworn explanation of their\n\nfailure to do so.\u201d Id. at 12.\n\n        The Court had questions about the \u201cclear inconsistency (regarding both number and nature)\n\nbetween the 15 documents that EOUSA produced to Hernandez in response to this Court\u2019s first in\n\ncamera review order and the 18 documents that EOUSA originally deemed non-responsive to\n\nHernandez\u2019s request.\u201d ECF 45 at 4. As such, this Court ordered the EOUSA to submit for in camera\n\nreview (1) the full set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the USAO\/TXW when\n\nthe office first referred Hernandez\u2019s request to that jurisdiction; and (2) the full set of documents\n\nthat the EOUSA obtained from the USAO\/TXW for reprocessing. Id. at 5. These two sets of\n\ndocuments were submitted, received, and reviewed in camera. The Court now resolves the cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The sole issue at the center of these cross motions is a narrow one. Hernandez only asks\n\nthis Court to determine whether Defendants have \u201csurrend[ered] the original 18-pages or\n\nprovide[d] a cogent sworn explanation of their failure to do so.\u201d ECF 38 at 12. The Court now\n\nconcludes that they have.\n\n       The Court has reviewed the set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the\n\nUSAO\/TXW, the set of documents that were later reprocessed, and the sworn declaration\n\naccompanying Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion that explains the USAO\/TXW\u2019s initial\n\nerror. See ECF 35-2 at 2\u20133. Based on this record, the Court finds that the EOUSA obtained 37\n\npages from the USAO\/TXW when it first referred Hernandez\u2019s records request (not 38 pages, as\n\nindicated on the office\u2019s initial form). Those 37 pages received from the USAO\/TXW match the\n\n37 pages that were later reprocessed. Excluding the 8 pages transferred to the DEA during both\n\ninitial processing and reprocessing leaves two sets of the same 29 pages. Thus, whatever set of \u201c18\n\npages\u201d the EOUSA deemed nonresponsive during its initial processing of 29 pages must be part\n\nof the second set of 29 pages that were reprocessed because the two sets are identical. And because\n\nthese 29 pages have now been produced to Plaintiff in full or in part, the contested \u201c18 pages\u201d\n\nmust have been surrendered\u2014there are simply no other documents to find, review, or turn over.\n\nTo the extent that, given the partial redactions, some information may have been withheld from\n\nthese documents, Hernandez does not contest the scope of the EOUSA\u2019s search during\n\nreprocessing or its bases for redaction. See generally ECF 38. Thus, with the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nnow indisputably surrendered or cogently accounted for via sworn testimony, see ECF 35-2 at 2,\n\nthe Court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The record establishes that the EOUSA made a mistake. The first set of 37 pages is identical\n\nto the second, which means the EOUSA mischaracterized or miscounted the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nwhen it received the first set of documents from the USAO\/TXW. The Court understands\n\nHernandez\u2019s frustration that the EOUSA \u201ccannot explain th[is] discrepancy.\u201d ECF 26-1 at 1. But\n\nthe EOUSA\u2019s error does not change the fact that Hernandez has now received all materials\n\nresponsive to his request, with some documents subject to only partial redactions (which\n\nHernandez does not challenge). The Court is satisfied that Defendants have adequately searched\n\nfor records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he\n\nis entitled.\n\n        Because Defendants have shouldered their burden under FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and DENIES Hernandez\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38.

The suit seeks to recover under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw for the allegedly negligent care that Rodr\u00edguez received at\n\nHSC during and following an abdominal surgery performed by Dr.\n\nIris V\u00e9lez Garc\u00eda (\"Dr. V\u00e9lez\") and Dr. Zacar\u00edas A.

Rodr\u00edguez -- who was then seventy-one years old\n\nand   living    with    several   chronic      health   conditions    including\n\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, and asthma -- was examined by Dr.\n\n\n\n\n1    Unless otherwise specified, all quotations in this section\nare drawn from reports prepared by the parties' proffered expert\nwitnesses summarizing the medical records from Rodr\u00edguez's visits\nto HSC.\n                                    - 1 -\n\fV\u00e9lez, who had been her regular gynecologist since 2005. Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nrecommended that Rodr\u00edguez undergo a bilateral oophorectomy via\n\nlaparotomy after a pelvic ultrasound revealed a \"complex cystic\n\nmass\" near Rodr\u00edguez's right ovary.\n\n            Dr. V\u00e9lez performed Rodr\u00edguez's surgery on April 21,\n\n2016, at HSC.        During the surgery, Dr. V\u00e9lez discovered that\n\nRodr\u00edguez had a \"frozen pelvis\" with multiple \"intraabdominal\n\nadhesions,\" and so she requested a surgical consultation from Dr.\n\nMateo, another gynecologist on HSC's staff.                   Dr. Mateo assisted\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez with Rodr\u00edguez's surgery.               On April 25, 2016, Rodr\u00edguez\n\nwas discharged from HSC after HSC staff observed \"positive bowel\n\nsounds\" and Rodr\u00edguez reported \"positive stool passage.\"\n\n            Four   days     later,    on    April      29,   during    a    scheduled\n\npostoperative      appointment       with   Dr.     V\u00e9lez    at   HSC,      Rodr\u00edguez\n\nreported that she had been experiencing \"nausea, vomiting, and\n\nabdominal\/pelvic pain since April 26.\" Rodr\u00edguez was then admitted\n\nto HSC's emergency department and was diagnosed with a presumed\n\nperforated sigmoid colon.        Later that day, Rodr\u00edguez underwent an\n\nemergency    exploratory       laparotomy         to    address       her    presumed\n\nperforated colon, during which Dr. V\u00e9lez, Dr. Mateo, and one Dr.\n\nOrtiz Rosado2 performed a \"partial colectomy with Hartman[n] pouch,\n\nend   colostomy[,]    and    subtotal       hysterectomy.\"         Rodr\u00edguez      was\n\n\n\n2     Dr. Ortiz Rosado is not a party to this suit.\n                                       - 2 -\n\fsubsequently admitted to HSC's intensive care unit (\"ICU\") in\n\ncritical condition.      She was intubated on a respirator with a\n\nnasogastric (\"NG\") tube, a colostomy bag, and a Foley catheter.\n\n           In   HSC's   ICU,   Rodr\u00edguez    received   care   from    various\n\nspecialists, including Dr. V\u00e9lez and staff from HSC's \"general\n\nsurgery,   internal     medicine,    infectious   disease,     cardiology,\n\npulmonology,      nephrology,       hematology\/oncology,       and       ENT\"\n\ndepartments.    Two days after her admission to the ICU, on May 1,\n\nRodr\u00edguez was diagnosed with \"bacteremia\/sepsis.\"         Then, on May 4,\n\nRodr\u00edguez tested positive for pseudomonas bacteria, at which point\n\nHSC's \"infection control program became involved\" with her care.\n\nHSC's   epidemiology     department     recommended     several      specific\n\ndisinfection protocols to treat Rodr\u00edguez's pseudomonas infection,\n\nbut \"[t]here is no documentation that these recommendations were\n\ncarried out at any time.\"\n\n           On May 6, HSC staff discovered that Rodr\u00edguez's stoma\n\nhad become necrotic.       Rodr\u00edguez consequently underwent a third\n\nsurgical procedure consisting of \"an exploratory laparotomy, ileal\n\nresection, transverse colon loop colostomy, enterography, and\n\nenteroclysis.\" Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Ortiz Rosado performed this third\n\nsurgery.    Rodr\u00edguez was then returned to the ICU, where she\n\ncontinued to receive care from HSC staff.\n\n           On May 12, nursing and infectious-disease staff noted\n\n\"the presence of worms and\/or maggots in the right nostril of\n                                    - 3 -\n\f[Rodr\u00edguez], where the NG tube was located.\"         A CT scan of\n\nRodr\u00edguez's sinuses was ordered, but there was otherwise \"little\n\nto no documentation of [any] consultations regarding the presence\n\nof worms nor any analysis of the source of these worms.\"\n\n          On May 15, it was \"documented that [Rodr\u00edguez's] fecal\n\ncollector [was] out of place.\"    The following day, HSC staff noted\n\nthat the fecal collector \"continue[d] to be displaced and that\n\nthere [was] abundant fecal material around the site [of the fecal\n\ncollector] as well as coming from\" an \"open wound\" near the site.\n\n          On May 18, two types of bacteria were detected in\n\ncultures of fluid taken from Rodr\u00edguez's abdomen.    That same day,\n\nHSC staff noted that Rodr\u00edguez was \"no longer responding to verbal\n\nor physical stimuli.\"      By the following afternoon, HSC staff\n\ndetermined that Rodr\u00edguez could not undergo a planned fourth\n\nprocedure \"due to worsening of her condition,\" and they obtained\n\na \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order from Rodr\u00edguez's family.

The operative complaint named as defendants Quality\n\nHealth Services of Puerto Rico, Inc., doing business as HSC\n\n(\"Quality Health\/HSC\"); Dr. V\u00e9lez; Dr. Mateo; Dr. Mateo's wife,\n\nBerris Castillo; the Mateo-Castillo         conjugal partnership; and\n\nseveral   other   individuals   and    corporations   \"whose   identities\n\n[were] unknown, [but who] by their negligent acts or omissions\n\ncaused or contributed to the damages claimed.\"3\n\n            The operative complaint asserted that \"[HSC] and [its]\n\npersonnel, including [Dr. V\u00e9lez] and [Dr. Mateo], were practicing\n\nbelow the standard of care in the treatment\" that they provided to\n\nRodr\u00edguez, and that Rodr\u00edguez's \"premature death . . . was caused\n\nby the negligent management of her condition.\"            The complaint\n\nalleged several departures from \"medical standards\" and instances\n\nof \"professional negligence\" in the defendants' care of Rodr\u00edguez\n\nwhich \"include[d], but [were] not limited to\":\n\n            failure to recognize, appropriately asses[s]\n            and repair damage to any organs involved in or\n            near the operative field prior to closing the\n            abdomen; failure to recognize that Mrs.\n            Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s sigmoid colon was damaged in this\n            circumstance and to perform an appropriate\n            repair procedure to assure sigmoid colon\n            integrity before abdominal closure; failure in\n            the proper management of hygiene by the\n\n3    The plaintiffs also named as a defendant,                 but   later\nvoluntarily dismissed, Fundaci\u00f3n San Cristobal, Inc.\n                                 - 5 -\n\f          hospital staff in the care of Mrs. Rodr\u00edguez;\n          failure in the documentation of the findings;\n          failure to manage the infectious processes\n          suffered by the patient; failure to manage the\n          patient's pre-existing condition of diabetes\n          which likely exacerbated her condition and\n          accelerated her demise; failure to timely\n          correct   the   displacement   of  the   fecal\n          collector[;] and failure to manage the\n          patient's care by presenting multiple pressure\n          ulcers at autopsy due to the fact that\n          apparently the staff did not make changes in\n          the patient's position in the required time.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that these alleged deficiencies in the care\n\nprovided to Rodr\u00edguez made the defendants liable for negligence\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.   See P.R. Laws tit. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 5141, 5142.   The\n\nplaintiffs sought $3 million in damages for pain and suffering.\n\n                                C.\n\n          To establish a prima facie case of negligence under\n\nPuerto Rico law, \"a plaintiff must establish (1) the duty owed\n\n(i.e., the minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill\n\nrequired in the relevant circumstances), (2) an act or omission\n\ntransgressing that duty, and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between\n\nthe breach and the claimed harm.\u201d    Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry v.

Instead, to\n\nestablish \"a breach of a physician's duty of care,\" a plaintiff\n\n\"ordinarily must adduce expert testimony to limn the minimum\n\nacceptable standard and confirm the defendant doctor's failure to\n\nmeet it.\"    Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 190.\n\n            In preparation for trial, the District Court ordered the\n\nparties to submit a joint pretrial conference memorandum outlining\n\nthe contours of the case and the evidence that they would present\n\nat trial.      The plaintiffs indicated in the memorandum that they\n\nwould rely on the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Jason S.\n\nJames (\"Dr. James\"), to establish the defendants' negligence.            The\n\nplaintiffs asserted that Dr. James would\n\n            testify as a medical expert in obstetrics,\n            gynecology[,] and general medicine about his\n            professional qualifications, his review of the\n            medical records in this case, the applicable\n            medical standards, his expert report and\n            deposition   testimony,    the   reports    of\n            defendants' experts, his professional opinion\n            as to the departures from the medical\n            standards by defendants in the treatment\n            provided to [Rodr\u00edguez] and their causal\n            relationship with [Rodr\u00edguez's] injuries and\n            premature death[,] and about any applicable\n            medical literature in support of his opinion.\n\nThe plaintiffs also \"reserve[d] the right to use as their own any\n\nexpert witness announced by the defendants.\"\n                                   - 7 -\n\f               Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo represented that they would each\n\ncall an      expert witness       of their own, and      Quality Health\/HSC\n\nrepresented that it would call its own expert witness as well.\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez represented that her expert, Dr. Adri\u00e1n Col\u00f3n Laracuente,\n\nwould testify as to Dr. V\u00e9lez's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez \"from the\n\ngynecological and surgical standpoint . . . and her compliance\n\nwith the standard of care.\" Dr. Mateo represented that his expert,\n\ngynecological specialist Dr. Alfredo S. Col\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez, would\n\ntestify \"regarding his opinion that Dr. Mateo complied with all\n\nthe applicable medical standards while providing assistance during\n\nthe    two   surgical   interventions      to   [Rodr\u00edguez]     in   which   his\n\nassistance was requested.\"           Quality Health\/HSC represented that\n\nits expert, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez, would testify\n\nas    to   \"the   standard   of    care   applicable    to   this    case,   the\n\ncorrectness of the treatment given to\" Rodr\u00edguez by HSC staff,\n\n\"and    that    such   treatment    did   not   cause   [the]   plaintiff[s']\n\ndamages.\"\n\n               Following a pretrial conference, the District Court\n\nreferred the case to a magistrate judge for mediation.               Mediation\n\nwas unsuccessful, in part because the defendants represented at\n\nthe settlement conference that they intended to file motions in\n\nlimine, the resolution of which had the potential to affect the\n\nparties' settlement efforts.\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\f          Two separate motions in limine were filed -- one by\n\nQuality Health\/HSC and the other by Dr. Mateo, Berris Castillo,\n\nand the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership, joined by Dr. V\u00e9lez.\n\nThe motions sought to exclude the expert opinion testimony of the\n\nplaintiffs' expert, Dr. James.          Both motions argued that Dr.\n\nJames's testimony must be excluded because his expert report did\n\nnot comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) and because,\n\neven if the report did, the plaintiffs had not met their burden\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to show that his testimony was\n\nadmissible.\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 requires parties in\n\ncivil cases to disclose their witnesses. Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires\n\nthat the disclosure of any witness \"retained or specially employed\n\nto provide expert testimony\" include a written report prepared and\n\nsigned by the expert witness which \"must contain,\" among other\n\nrequirements, \"a complete statement of all opinions the witness\n\nwill express and the basis and reasons for them.\"         Rule 26(e)(2)\n\nthen requires that the proponent of an expert witness \"supplement\"\n\ntheir   initial   disclosure   to    alert   opposing   parties   to   any\n\nsubsequent \"additions or changes\" to the content of the expert's\n\ntestimony.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1), meanwhile,\n\nprovides that \"[i]f a party fails to provide information                or\n\nidentify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is\n\nnot allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence\n                                    - 9 -\n\fon a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was\n\nsubstantially justified or is harmless.\"\n\n            Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility\n\nof expert opinion testimony.             It provides that a qualified expert\n\nwitness \"may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" only\n\nif   the   party    seeking      to   introduce      the    witness's     testimony\n\ndemonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) the\n\nwitness's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n\nwill help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n\ndetermine   a     fact    in   issue\";    (b)    \"the   testimony    is   based   on\n\nsufficient facts or data\"; (c) \"the testimony is the product of\n\nreliable principles and methods\"; and (d) \"the expert's opinion\n\nreflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to\n\nthe facts of the case.\"          Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n            Dr.     James's      expert     report      first     summarized      his\n\nqualifications       as    a    licensed        physician    and    gynecological\n\nspecialist \"well versed in the current standards of care applicable\n\nto the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.\"                  Dr. James's report\n\nstated that, \"[i]n this matter, [his] opinions [were] based on\n\n[certain enumerated] medical records and documents . . . and on\n\nreliable and accepted scientific principles to a reasonable degree\n\nof medical certainty.\"          The report next stated that Dr. James had\n\nreviewed the hospital records associated with Rodr\u00edguez's stays at\n\nHSC between April 21 and April 25, 2016, and between April 29 and\n                                      - 10 -\n\fMay 19, 2016, as well as Dr. V\u00e9lez's office records pertaining to\n\nher care of Rodr\u00edguez since 2005.       The report then recited the\n\nfacts of Rodr\u00edguez's case and closed with Dr. James's \"Comment\" on\n\nthe case.    In that \"Comment\" section, Dr. James wrote:\n\n            Based on the medical documents submitted, it\n            appears that [Rodr\u00edguez] expired from sepsis\n            and septic shock, a condition caused by the\n            perforated sigmoid colon that occurred in the\n            initial surgery on April 21, 2016 performed by\n            Dr. [V\u00e9lez] and Dr. [Mateo].      This patient\n            encountered several organisms throughout her\n            various organ systems: Klebsiella pneumonia,\n            Pseudomonas   aeruginosa,   and   Enterococcus\n            faecalis in the blood, in the inguinal and\n            perianal secretions, in the urine, in the\n            colostomy, and in the throat, as noted in the\n            autopsy report.       In addition, the most\n            surprising finding was the worms and\/or\n            maggots that were noted to be present in the\n            nostril of the patient where the NG tube was\n            placed.    There is little room for doubt\n            regarding the inappropriate nature and poor\n            hygiene which was utilized by the hospital\n            personnel in caring for [Rodr\u00edguez]. There is\n            poor documentation regarding this unusual\n            discovery and no evidence that appropriate\n            precautions were taken to prevent this\n            occurrence or to remedy the situation once it\n            was realized.      There is no evidence of\n            appropriate disinfection of the hospital room,\n            equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n            herself as recommended by infectious disease\n            and epidemiology. In addition, there appears\n            to be poor management of [Rodr\u00edguez's] medical\n            comorbidities, such as inadequate care for her\n            diabetes   which    likely   exacerbated   her\n            condition and accelerated her demise.       It\n            appears that her fecal collector remained out\n            of place for more than 24 hours after\n            discovering it had become dislodged, allowing\n            fecal material to contaminate the stoma as\n            well as the open wound itself. Further, there\n            is evidence on autopsy of multiple pressure\n                               - 11 -\n\f           ulcers, which lends further evidence of the\n           substandard care that [Rodr\u00edguez] received\n           during her admission at [HSC].\n\n           In conclusion, it is my opinion -- based upon\n           a     reasonable     degree     of     medical\n           certainty -- that in the case discussed above\n           there were numerous deviations, failures, and\n           departures from acceptable standards of care\n           on the part of Dr. [V\u00e9lez], Dr. Mateo, as well\n           as on the part of [HSC] and its staff.\n\n           In their motions to exclude Dr. James's expert testimony\n\nunder Rule 26, the defendants argued that Dr. James's expert report\n\n\"fail[ed] to state the totality of his opinions in this case . . .\n\nconsidering the scope of the testimony stated in the Pretrial\n\nReport and which [the p]laintiffs apparently intend[ed] to present\n\nat trial.\" The defendants further contended that the report \"[did]\n\nnot state the applicable standards of care; [did] not specify\n\nwhether the standards of care are applicable on a national basis;\n\n[did] not state how the applicable standards were specifically\n\nbreached\"; did not explain how the defendants' \"alleged negligence\n\ncaused and\/or contributed to [Rodr\u00edguez's] condition and demise\";\n\nand was \"conspicuously lacking in reference or citations to medical\n\nliterature.\"      Accordingly, the defendants argued that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony had to be excluded under Rule 37(c).\n\n           Alternatively, the defendants argued that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony should be \"excluded as speculative\" under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 702.      They contended that was so because Dr. James's\n\nexpert   report    did   not   articulate   either   a   \"[s]cientifically\n                                   - 12 -\n\facceptable    methodology\"         or   \"the     bases      and   foundations    that\n\nunderlie [his] expert opinion\" and because nothing else in the\n\nrecord enabled the plaintiffs to meet their burden to show that\n\nhis testimony was admissible under Rule 702.\n\n             The   plaintiffs      opposed       the    defendants'       motions   to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony.             The plaintiffs did not request,\n\nhowever, that the District Court hold a hearing on the merits of\n\nthe motions at which Dr. James could testify.                   Nor did they request\n\nleave to supplement Dr. James's expert report.                           Instead, the\n\nplaintiffs    argued   that     the     entirety       of   Dr.    James's   proposed\n\ntestimony was admissible based on the expert report itself.\n\n             The District Court granted the defendants' motions to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony.            In so ruling, the District Court\n\nrelied entirely on Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\n\n             As to Dr. V\u00e9lez's and Dr. Mateo's motion under Rule 702\n\nto exclude Dr. James's testimony, the District Court reasoned that\n\nDr. James's expert report \"conclude[d] as a matter of fact that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated' [Rodr\u00edguez's] sigmoid colon\n\nduring the first surgery on April 21, 2016\" but provided \"no\n\nexplanation\" for that conclusion, instead \"seemingly assum[ing]\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo did so because [Rodr\u00edguez] returned\n\nto   [HSC]   complaining      of    pelvic     pain      some     days   after   being\n\ndischarged\" and was found to have had a perforated sigmoid colon\n\nat that time.      The District Court held that that assumption was\n                                        - 13 -\n\f\"not enough for a finding that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated\n\nthe colon.\"     The District Court further observed that although Dr.\n\nJames \"conclude[d that] Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from\n\nacceptable standards of care,\" his report did not \"state what those\n\nstandards are, nor where they come from[, nor] how Dr. V\u00e9lez and\n\nDr. Mateo deviated from them.\"\n\n            As to Quality Health\/HSC's motion under Rule 702 to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony, the District Court concluded that\n\nDr. James's opinions regarding the alleged negligence of HSC staff\n\n\"fare[d]   no   better\"   than    his   opinions    regarding     the   alleged\n\nnegligence of Drs. Mateo and V\u00e9lez.         And that was so, the District\n\nCourt explained, even though the report pointed to several alleged\n\ndepartures from acceptable standards of care, because \"nowhere in\n\n[his] report [did] Dr. James identify the standard of care that\n\n[HSC's] hospital staff should have adhered to; where that standard\n\ncomes from; and how the staff deviated from that standard.\"\n\n            At the same time that the District Court granted the\n\ndefendants' motions to exclude Dr. James's testimony under Rule\n\n702, the District Court also granted the defendants' requested\n\nleave to move for summary judgment within ten days.                Dr. Mateo,\n\nBerris Castillo, and the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership moved\n\nfor summary judgment seven days later, which motion Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\njoined;    Quality   Health\/HSC    filed    its    own   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment two days later.\n                                   - 14 -\n\f            The    plaintiffs       opposed       both    motions    for     summary\n\njudgment, arguing that even if Dr. James's testimony were excluded,\n\nthey   could     rely   on    the   testimony      of    the   defendants'    expert\n\nwitnesses to prove their case.            In the alternative, the plaintiffs\n\nasked the District Court to reconsider its ruling excluding Dr.\n\nJames's expert testimony, as they contended that the defendants\n\nwere not entitled to summary judgment if Dr. James's testimony\n\nwere not excluded.\n\n            The District Court denied the plaintiffs' request for\n\nreconsideration,        granted     the   defendants'      motions   for     summary\n\njudgment, dismissed the plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, and\n\nentered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs timely\n\nappealed the District Court's entry of summary judgment.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            We    first      address   the      plaintiffs'     challenge    to   the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr.\n\nMateo.   \"'To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving\n\nparty must demonstrate the existence of a trialworthy issue as to\n\nsome material fact,' i.e., a fact that 'potentially could affect\n\nthe suit's outcome.'\"          L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez v.

The\n\nplaintiffs now contend that this Rule 702 ruling was in error.\n\nThe   plaintiffs   do   not    suggest   in   advancing   that   contention,\n\nhowever, that they can meet their burden to show that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony is admissible under Rule 702 based on anything extrinsic\n\nto his expert report.4        The plaintiffs simply contend based on the\n\nreport itself that the District Court abused its discretion in\n\nruling that the plaintiffs had failed to meet that burden.5              The\n\nplaintiffs then go on to contend, in the alternative, that we must\n\n\n\n4    The plaintiffs assert as part of their challenge to the\nDistrict Court's Rule 702 ruling that the District Court's decision\nto exclude Dr. James's report altogether after finding it deficient\nwas \"too extreme of a sanction\" -- but they conceded at oral\nargument that they never requested leave to amend Dr. James's\nexpert report to cure its alleged deficiencies, and they point to\nno authority suggesting that the District Court should have sua\nsponte granted them leave to do so before excluding the testimony.\n5    Although the plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred\nby not holding a Daubert hearing on the admissibility of Dr.\nJames's testimony before granting the defendants' motions in\nlimine to exclude it, the contention fails for the same reasons we\nrejected a similar contention in Gonz\u00e1lez-Arroyo v. Doctors'\nCenter Hospital Bayam\u00f3n, Inc., 54 F.4th 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2022).\n                                    - 16 -\n\foverturn the summary judgment ruling even if the District Court's\n\nRule 702 determination was not error.          And that is so, they\n\ncontend, because of evidence in the record that is independent of\n\nDr. James's testimony.        For the reasons set forth below, we\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs' grounds for challenging the summary\n\njudgment ruling have no merit.\n\n                                   A.\n\n          To   assess   the   plaintiffs'   challenge   to   the   summary\n\njudgment ruling at issue, it helps to focus first on the aspect of\n\nthat challenge that concerns the District Court's ruling excluding\n\nDr. James's testimony under Rule 702.          To do so, we begin by\n\nreviewing the requirements that Rule 702 sets forth before then\n\nturning back to the District Court's Rule 702 ruling.          With that\n\nfoundation in place, we then will be well-positioned to explain\n\nwhy the plaintiffs' challenge to the grant of summary judgment to\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo fails.\n\n                                   1.\n\n          Rule 702 provides in full that:\n\n          A witness who is qualified as an expert by\n          knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n          education may testify in the form of an\n          opinion   or  otherwise if   the  proponent\n          demonstrates to the court that it is more\n          likely than not that:\n\n          (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or\n          other specialized knowledge will help the\n          trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n          determine a fact in issue;\n                                 - 17 -\n\f          (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts\n          or data;\n\n          (c) the testimony is the product of reliable\n          principles and methods; and\n\n          (d) the expert\u2019s opinion reflects a reliable\n          application of the principles and methods to\n          the facts of the case.6\n\n          Rule   702,   in   its     present    form,   incorporates   the\n\nreasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).          See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 702 advisory committee's notes to 2000 amendment.         There,\n\nthe Court construed an earlier version of the rule and explained\n\nthat it assigns a \"gatekeeping role for the judge\" to determine\n\nwhether \"an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation\n\nand is relevant to the task at hand.\"          Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597.\n\n          As a result, the present version of Rule 702 \"affirms\n\nthe trial court's role as gatekeeper and provides some general\n\nstandards that the trial court must use to assess the reliability\n\nand helpfulness of proffered expert testimony.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 702\n\nadvisory committee's notes to 2000 amendment.           To that end, the\n\npresent version of the rule establishes that expert testimony may\n\n\n\n\n6    This is the current version of Rule 702, which went into\neffect on December 1, 2023.     See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory\ncommittee's notes to 2023 amendment. However, the application of\nthe rule to this case is not affected by the 2023 changes. See\nFed. R. Evid. 702 (2011) (amended 2023).\n                                   - 18 -\n\fbe admitted into evidence only if it is \"based on sufficient facts\n\nor data,\" is \"the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and\n\n\"reflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to\n\nthe facts of the case.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n            Moreover, in applying Rule 702, we continue to draw on\n\nDaubert's reasoning. See, e.g., Milward v. Acuity Specialty Prods.\n\nGrp., Inc., (Milward I), 639 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2011).                   Thus,\n\n\"[t]he focus\" of the inquiry into the admissibility of expert\n\ntestimony   under      Rule    702   \"must   be    solely    on    principles   and\n\nmethodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\"                 Daubert,\n\n509 U.S. at 595.       This distinction means that \"[w]hen the factual\n\nunderpinning of an expert's opinion is weak, it is a matter\n\naffecting the weight and credibility of the testimony\" and thus \"a\n\nquestion to be resolved by the jury.\"              Milward I, 639 F.3d at 22\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n            At the same time, \"nothing in either Daubert or the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit\n\nopinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\n\nipse dixit of the expert.\"             Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\n\n136, 146 (1997).       Indeed, Daubert made clear that to be admissible\n\nunder   Rule    702,    an    expert's   opinion     \"must    be    supported   by\n\nappropriate validation\" and rest on \"more than subjective belief\n\nor unsupported speculation.\"           509 U.S. at 590.      Thus, in assessing\n\nwhether   the   expert       opinion   has   the   requisite       validation   for\n                                       - 19 -\n\fpurposes of Rule 702, a court may conclude that it does not\n\nbecause, given the record at hand, \"there is simply too great an\n\nanalytical   gap   between   the   data     and   the   opinion   proffered.\"\n\nJoiner, 522 U.S. at 146.\n\n          We note that \"[t]he party seeking to introduce the\n\nevidence has the burden of establishing both its reliability and\n\nits relevance,\" Milward II, 820 F.3d at 473 (citing Daubert, 509\n\nU.S. at 593 n.10), and that we review a district court's ruling on\n\nthe admissibility of expert testimony under Rule 702 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, assessing \"[p]redicate factual findings\" for \"clear\n\nerror\" and \"pure questions of law . . . de novo,\" id. at 472.\n\n                                     2.\n\n          In its ruling under Rule 702 concerning Dr. James's\n\ntestimony, the District Court explained that Dr. James's expert\n\nreport asserted two opinions about the alleged negligence of Drs.\n\nMateo and V\u00e9lez: that \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated'\n\n[Rodr\u00edguez's] sigmoid colon during the first surgery on April 21,\n\n2016,\" and that \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable\n\nstandards of care\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.               The District\n\nCourt then determined that Dr. James's testimony setting forth\n\nthose two opinions was inadmissible under Rule 702, excluding on\n\nthat basis the entirety of Dr. James's testimony as to Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nand Dr. Mateo.\n\n\n                                   - 20 -\n\f            Notably,   by    excluding      all   of     Dr.     James's     expert\n\ntestimony as to those two defendants, the District Court excluded\n\nDr. James's testimony concerning his opinion that, \"[b]ased on the\n\nmedical documents submitted, it appears that [Rodr\u00edguez] expired\n\nfrom sepsis and septic shock, a condition caused by the perforated\n\nsigmoid colon that occurred in the initial surgery on April 21,\n\n2016 performed by [Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo].\"              The District Court\n\nappears to have done so because it treated Dr. James's opinion in\n\nthat regard as if it were a \"conclu[sion] as a matter of fact that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated'\" Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon\n\nduring the April 21 surgery.          Rivera Rodr\u00edguez v. Quality Health\n\nServs. P.R., Civ. No. 18-1287 (PAD), 2022 WL 3445348, at *4 (D.P.R.\n\nAug. 4, 2022).\n\n            To support that aspect of the Rule 702 determination,\n\nthe District Court explained that \"Dr. James seemingly assume[d]\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo [perforated Rodr\u00edguez's colon] because\n\n[Rodr\u00edguez] returned to [HSC] complaining of pelvic pain some days\n\nafter   being   discharged    from    her     first    surgery    [and]    it    was\n\nultimately discovered that she had a perforated colon.\"                Id.      But,\n\nthe District Court explained, such an assumption was \"not enough\n\n[to support] a finding that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated the\n\ncolon[.]\"       Id.    The    District        Court    then      supported      that\n\ndetermination in a footnote by stating that \"Dr. James's conclusion\n\n[was] contradicted by the medical record\" because, several days\n                                     - 21 -\n\fafter the April 21 surgery, on \"April 25, 2016, [Rodr\u00edguez] was\n\ntolerating a regular diet and passing flatus and stool normally\n\nand was deemed ready for discharge.\"          Id. at *4 n.3.    Yet, the\n\nDistrict Court reasoned, Dr. James \"inexplicably state[d] that Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated [Rodr\u00edguez's] colon\" on April 21.\n\nId.\n\n            There is some force to the plaintiffs' contention that\n\nthe District Court erred in this aspect of its ruling under Rule\n\n702 because it wrongly based the ruling on its own assessment of\n\nthe \"factual underpinning\" of the opinion by Dr. James that was\n\nexcluded.    Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595.         As Daubert makes clear,\n\nquestions about the strength of \"the factual underpinning of an\n\nexpert's    opinion\"   are    \"matter[s]    affecting   the   weight   and\n\ncredibility of the testimony\" and therefore \"a question to be\n\nresolved by the jury.\"       Id.\n\n            Moreover, the District Court appears to have understood\n\nthat Dr. James's testimony would set forth the opinion that Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated the colon during the surgery on\n\nApril 21, rather than merely that the colon was perforated during\n\nthat surgery.   While the District Court explained its reasons for\n\nconcluding that testimony by Dr. James that those defendants\n\nperforated the colon at that time was not admissible under Rule\n\n702, it gave no reason for concluding that Rule 702 barred Dr.\n\nJames from simply testifying that the colon was perforated then,\n                                   - 22 -\n\fwithout explicitly attributing the act of perforation to either of\n\nthose defendants.\n\n           Dr. James's expert report, however, opines only that the\n\nperforation of Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon occurred in the initial\n\nsurgery on April 21.        It does not assert at any point that the\n\nperforation occurred due to any action that either Dr. Mateo or\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez took at that time -- or, for that matter, at any other\n\ntime.    Indeed, in that respect, the report accords with the\n\nplaintiffs' operative complaint, which also does not allege at any\n\npoint that Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr. Mateo acted negligently by perforating\n\nRodr\u00edguez's colon.       Instead, the operative complaint alleges that\n\ntheir negligence lay in their \"failure to recognize, appropriately\n\nassess and repair damage to any organs involved in or near the\n\noperative field prior to closing the abdomen\" and their \"failure\n\nto recognize that [Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s] sigmoid colon was damaged in this\n\ncircumstance and to perform an appropriate repair procedure to\n\nassure sigmoid colon integrity before abdominal closure.\"\n\n           Despite   these    potential    problems    with    the   District\n\nCourt's analysis of the admissibility of this specific portion of\n\nDr.   James's   expert    testimony    under   Rule   702,    we   reject   the\n\nplaintiffs' separate contention that the District Court abused its\n\ndiscretion in excluding Dr. James's broad conclusion that \"Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of care\" in\n\ntheir treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.         With respect to that aspect of the\n                                  - 23 -\n\fDistrict   Court's       ruling    under     Rule   702,    Dr.    James's     report\n\nidentifies     no   national      standard    of    care    against    which   those\n\ndefendants'     assertedly     negligent       acts    or   omissions      could   be\n\nmeasured by the trier of fact.             There also is no other basis in\n\nthe record for concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nDr. James's opinion that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo acted negligently\n\nis \"the product of reliable principles and methods.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702(c).    We thus agree with Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo that the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that Dr. James's opinion that\n\n\"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of\n\ncare\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez could \"only be construed as\n\none   based    on   a    res   ipsa   loquitur        inference,      an   inference\n\ninsufficient to withstand scrutiny in this setting.\"                           Rivera\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 2022 WL 3445348, at *4 (citing L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez v.

As we\n\nwill   next    explain,     we   conclude       that   the    answer   is    that    the\n\nchallenge has none.\n\n                                           3.\n\n              To   be    sure,   as   we   have   explained,     it    may   be     that\n\ntestimony from Dr. James that Rodr\u00edguez's colon was perforated\n\nduring the April 21 surgery was wrongly excluded under Rule 702.\n\nBut even if we were to assume as much, there still would be no\n\nbasis in the record from which a reasonable juror could conclude\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo were negligent as alleged, given that\n\nthe District Court did not err in excluding Dr. James's testimony\n\nthat \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards\n\nof care\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n              We recognize that the plaintiffs do contend that the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment was in error because,\n\neven without Dr. James's opinion as to Dr. V\u00e9lez's and Dr. Mateo's\n\nnegligence, the plaintiffs could have relied at trial on the\n\ntestimony of the defendants' expert witnesses to \"help the jury to\n\ndetermine both the proper standards of care and the causal nexus\n\nbetween     [the]       defendants'    negligence       and    [the    p]laintiffs'\n\ndamages.\"      To support this contention, the plaintiffs point out\n\nthat none of the defendants' expert witnesses' reports expressly\n\nrefutes Dr. James's conclusion that Rodr\u00edguez \"expired from sepsis\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fand septic shock, a condition caused by the perforated sigmoid\n\ncolon that occurred in the initial surgery on April 21, 2016.\"\n\n          In    granting   the    defendants'    motions    for   summary\n\njudgment, however, the District Court determined that it was\n\n\"irrelevant    whether   [the]   defendants'    experts'   reports   . . .\n\nrefute Dr. James'[s] conclusion\" that Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon\n\nwas perforated during her initial surgery.7       As the District Court\n\nnoted, all of the defendants' experts opined that the \"defendants'\n\nactions did not deviate from the standards of care.\"         As such, the\n\nDistrict Court concluded that the defense experts' trial testimony\n\nwould not \"align . . . with [the] plaintiffs' legal theories or\n\notherwise lend any support to their case.\"         And, upon a thorough\n\nreview of the evidentiary record, we find no basis on which to\n\ndisagree with the determination that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo were\n\nentitled to summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n7    We note that the District Court gave as one ground for\nrejecting this challenge to the grant of summary judgment the\nabsence of any evidence in the record that would permit a\nreasonable juror to find that the colon was perforated on April\n21. But, for the reasons we have explained, there would be such\nevidence in the record if the District Court erred in excluding\nunder Rule 702 Dr. James's opinion as to when the colon was\nperforated. Thus, we address above the District Court's grounds\nfor rejecting the plaintiffs' challenge to its summary judgment\nruling on the understanding that such evidence would be in the\nrecord, as, for present purposes, we are assuming it was error to\nexclude that aspect of Dr. James's testimony.\n                                  - 26 -\n\f              None of the defendants' experts' reports sets forth any\n\nopinion      that   would    support    the    plaintiffs'       theory    that   any\n\nnegligent     act     or   omission    by   Dr.    V\u00e9lez    or   Dr.   Mateo    caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez's decline and\/or her premature death.                     In his report,\n\nDr. Mateo's proffered expert, Dr. Alfredo S. Col\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez,\n\nconcluded that Dr. Mateo's \"involvement in this complicated case\n\n[did] not deviate[] from the standards of care\" applicable to the\n\nprocedures in which he participated.                 And Dr. V\u00e9lez's proffered\n\nexpert, Dr. Adri\u00e1n Col\u00f3n Laracuente, concluded in his report that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez \"did not deviate from the standard of care in her\n\ntreatment\" of Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n              True, if the District Court had admitted Dr. James's\n\nopinion that Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon was perforated during the\n\nApril   21    surgery      performed   by     Drs.   Mateo    and   V\u00e9lez,     then   a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could have inferred that Rodr\u00edguez's\n\neventual death from sepsis and septic shock resulted from the\n\nsurgery on that date.            But even if the trier of fact could\n\nreasonably infer causation from that opinion, the record would\n\nstill lack any basis for a finding that either Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr.\n\nMateo committed any breach of an applicable standard of care that\n\nled to the perforation of Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon during that\n\nsurgery.\n\n              Thus,    the   record    in   this     case    contains     no   \"expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n                                       - 27 -\n\fdefendant doctor[s']   failure to meet it,\" as is required      to\n\n\"establish[] a breach of a physician's duty of care\" under Puerto\n\nRico's negligence statute.     Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 190.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo.\n\n                                III.\n\n          Having affirmed the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendants Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo, we now must address\n\nthe plaintiffs' challenge to the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to Quality Health\/HSC.    Here, too, the plaintiffs base\n\ntheir challenge both on a contention that the District Court erred\n\nin excluding under Rule 702 the expert testimony of Dr. James and,\n\nin the alternative, on the ground that the District Court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Quality Health\/HSC even assuming that\n\nsuch testimony was properly excluded.\n\n          In pressing their challenge to this summary judgment\n\nruling, the plaintiffs appear to be advancing two distinct theories\n\nby which their claim of negligence against Quality Health\/HSC may\n\nsurvive that defendant's motion for summary judgment. One of these\n\ntheories is predicated on HSC staff's alleged failure to utilize\n\nproper hygiene in their care of Rodr\u00edguez. The other is predicated\n\non HSC staff's alleged failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ncomorbidity of diabetes.     We address each of these theories of\n\nliability separately, addressing, with respect to each, both the\n                               - 28 -\n\fplaintiffs' challenge to the relevant Rule 702 ruling as to Dr.\n\nJames's testimony and their contention that, even assuming the\n\nRule 702 ruling was sound, the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth\/HSC was not.\n\n                                A.\n\n          Insofar as the plaintiffs premise their challenge to the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Quality Health\/HSC on HSC\n\nstaff's alleged hygiene-related failures, they do so in part by\n\nchallenging the District Court's decision to exclude Dr. James's\n\ntestimony under Rule 702.   The plaintiffs argue that Dr. James's\n\nexpert report \"clearly express[ed]\" multiple \"deficiencies\" in HSC\n\nstaff's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.      And it is true that several of\n\nthose alleged deficiencies relate to the plaintiffs' allegation\n\nthat HSC staff utilized \"inappropriate and poor hygiene at [HSC]\n\nand in the care of [Rodr\u00edguez].\"     In that regard, the plaintiffs\n\nrefer to several facts that Dr. James asserts in his expert report\n\nleave \"little room for doubt regarding the inappropriate nature\n\nand poor hygiene which was utilized by [HSC] personnel in caring\n\nfor [Rodr\u00edguez]\" -- such as the presence of \"several organisms\n\nthroughout her various organ systems\" and \"worms and\/or maggots\"\n\nin her nostril, the lack of \"evidence of appropriate disinfection\n\nof the hospital room, equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n\nherself,\" and the fact that Rodr\u00edguez's \"fecal collector remained\n\nout of place for more than 24 hours.\"\n                              - 29 -\n\f             Nothing    in    Dr.    James's      report    purports       to    opine,\n\nhowever,     that   any     of   these     hygiene-related         failures     caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez's decline or premature death.                   Nor is there any other\n\nevidence     in   the   summary     judgment      record    that    the   plaintiffs\n\nidentify that would provide a basis on which a reasonable trier of\n\nfact could find such causation.             And that is true even if we take\n\naccount of the testimony of the defendants' own expert witnesses.\n\n             That   being    so,    we    do   not   see    how    the    plaintiffs'\n\nchallenge to the District Court's ruling to exclude Dr. James's\n\ntestimony under Rule 702 provides any support for their challenge\n\nto the grant of summary judgment to Quality Health\/HSC insofar as\n\nthat challenge rests on a claim of negligence owing to HSC staff's\n\nhygiene-related failures in their care for Rodr\u00edguez.                      After all,\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim of negligence is that the \"premature death\n\nof [Rodr\u00edguez] was caused by the negligent management of her\n\ncondition.\"       Accordingly, even if we were to assume that there is\n\nmerit   to   the    plaintiffs'      challenge       to    the    District      Court's\n\nexclusionary ruling under Rule 702 with respect to Dr. James's\n\ntestimony concerning the poor hygiene-related practices of HSC\n\nstaff, the plaintiffs' challenge to the grant of summary judgment\n\nto Quality Health\/HSC fails insofar as it rests on the allegation\n\nthat HSC staff's failures in that regard caused Rodr\u00edguez's decline\n\nand premature death.\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f                                              B.\n\n           We turn, then, to the plaintiffs' remaining contention\n\nas to their challenge to the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth\/HSC -- a contention that rests on the theory that HSC\n\nstaff's failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez's comorbidity of\n\ndiabetes led to her decline and premature death.                         Here, too, the\n\nplaintiffs contend in part that the District Court erred in\n\nexcluding Dr. James's report under Rule 702.                           But, once again,\n\nthey also contend in the alternative that, even if that ruling was\n\nsound, the grant of summary judgment was not because they could\n\nhave   relied    on       other    evidence        in   the    record    to    prove       this\n\nallegation.\n\n           With respect to the plaintiffs' challenge to the Rule\n\n702 ruling, Dr. James's report contains the opinion that \"poor\n\nmanagement      of       [Rodr\u00edguez's]        medical     comorbidities,            such     as\n\ninadequate      care      for     her   diabetes[,]           likely    exacerbated         her\n\ncondition and accelerated her demise.\"                    With this assertion, Dr.\n\nJames clearly opines that HSC staff's management of Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ndiabetes   was       a   cause    of    her   premature         death.        And   he     also\n\ncharacterizes that management as \"poor\" and \"inadequate.\"\n\n           Nonetheless, the District Court determined that this\n\nopinion must be excluded because \"nowhere in the report does Dr.\n\nJames identify the standard of care that [HSC] staff should have\n\nadhered to\" in their management of Rodr\u00edguez's diabetes; \"where\n                                         - 31 -\n\fthat standard comes from; and how the staff deviated from that\n\nstandard.\"   We agree.\n\n           In the absence of both an articulated standard of care\n\nand any specific allegations of acts or omissions by HSC staff\n\nthat deviated from that standard of care, we cannot see that Dr.\n\nJames's   opinion   that    HSC   staff's    management      of   Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ndiabetes was \"poor\" and \"inadequate\" is \"the product of reliable\n\nprinciples and methods,\" as Rule 702 requires.                Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702(c).   Thus, even if we were to assume that it was error for the\n\nDistrict Court to have excluded Dr. James's testimony that HSC\n\nstaff's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez's diabetes caused her decline and\n\npremature death, we see no basis for concluding that it was error\n\nto exclude the portion of Dr. James's opinion that pertains to\n\nwhether that treatment was improper.\n\n           This   aspect    of    our   assessment     of   the   plaintiffs'\n\nchallenge to the District Court's Rule 702 exclusion ends up being\n\ndispositive of their summary judgment challenge.            That is because,\n\nwith Dr. James's opinion pertaining to a breach of the duty of\n\ncare excluded, there is nothing else in the summary judgment record\n\nthat could make up for it.\n\n           None of the defendants' expert witnesses opines that HSC\n\nstaff's   management   of   Rodr\u00edguez's     diabetes    deviated    from   any\n\napplicable standard of care. On the contrary, Quality Health\/HSC's\n\nproffered expert witness, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez,\n                                   - 32 -\n\fopines in her expert report that \"at all times relevant to the\n\n[operative]     Complaint,   [HSC]     personnel   acted   diligently,\n\nprudently[,] and reasonably and did not incurred in [sic] negligent\n\nacts.\"      Thus, without the existence in the record of \"expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n\ndefendant doctor[s'] failure to meet it,\" Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111\n\nF.3d at 190, we affirm the District Court's determination that\n\nQuality Health\/HSC was entitled to summary judgment in its favor\n\non the plaintiffs' claim of medical malpractice.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 33 -\n\f","          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNos. 22-1171\n     22-1172\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                           Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n  LUIS \u00c1NGEL COL\u00d3N-CORDERO, a\/k\/a Luis El Loco, a\/k\/a El Loco,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon.

Stephen Muldrow, United States Attorney, and Mariana E.\nBauz\u00e1-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                        January 19, 2024\n\f          THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.        When authorities picked up\n\nLuis \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n-Cordero (Col\u00f3n) for violating some terms of his\n\nsupervised release, they found evidence of other violations as\n\nwell as evidence of new criminal conduct.       And so, another in a\n\nlong line of examples of folks slipping into a criminal-justice-\n\nsystem spin cycle, Col\u00f3n found himself back in court for sentencing\n\nhearings regarding the new criminal case against him and revocation\n\nof his supervised release.     The parties agreed to request within-\n\nguidelines sentences, but the district court, not bound by the\n\nparties' recommendations, imposed an upwardly variant sentence of\n\nimprisonment for the new criminal conduct and a tip-top-of-the-\n\nguidelines-range term of imprisonment for violating his supervised\n\nrelease, with those sentences to run consecutively.       On appeal,\n\nCol\u00f3n raises a number of arguments challenging the pronounced\n\nsentences as unreasonable.     For reasons we'll explain, we vacate\n\nand remand for resentencing.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          We begin with the relevant facts and travel, providing\n\nthe bulk of the particulars now (bear with us) with plans to add\n\nsome more detail later as needed.         As usual when a sentencing\n\nappeal follows a plea of guilty, we draw the facts from the\n\nuncontested   parts   of   the    probation    office's   presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSR), the plea agreement, and the transcript\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fof the sentencing hearing.      See United States v. Morales-Cortijo,\n\n65 F.4th 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2023).\n\n             Col\u00f3n's History, Supervised Release Term,\n                 Violations, and New Criminal Case\n\n           Back in 2017, Col\u00f3n pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\n\npossess   with   intent   to   distribute   controlled   substances   in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and he was sentenced to 45 months\n\nand 19 days of imprisonment and 8 years of supervised release.\n\nCol\u00f3n discharged that term of immurement and was released in 2019,\n\nand from there he began his term of supervised release.\n\n           Now, it is undisputed that Col\u00f3n is a person with an\n\nintellectual disability, and, as the record makes pellucid, he has\n\na history of mental health issues.          Some examples:    a school\n\nreferral prompted him to see a mental health specialist when he\n\nwas 15; he heated a car antenna, then used it to burn his forehead\n\nand under his eyes; he has used cigarettes to burn his forearms\n\nand blades to cut himself; and he has visible scars from his self-\n\ninflicted burning and cutting.      And, as of his 2017 plea, a then-\n\n25-year-old Col\u00f3n had a history of substance abuse, including\n\nsmoking marijuana (25 joints a day) since he was 18, and, at the\n\nsame age, developing a use of non-prescription Xanax, Percocet,\n\nand Klonopin (one or two pills daily), plus occasionally mixing\n\nsome of this drug use with alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 3 -\n\f            And so, as part of his August 2019 supervised release,\n\nCol\u00f3n was referred to substance abuse and mental health treatment.\n\nThe mental health treatment to which Col\u00f3n was later referred in\n\nJanuary 2020 screeched to a halt with the advent of the global\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its resulting lockdowns, but Col\u00f3n continued\n\nhis substance abuse treatment, which he reported he liked going to\n\nand found helpful.    For 14 months during his supervised release\n\nterm (up until he was arrested, anyway), Col\u00f3n tested positive to\n\ncannabinoids two times out of seventeen tests (more on this later)\n\nand failed to report to the drug-testing program once.\n\n            Aside from those two positive drug tests, which were\n\nviolations in and of themselves pursuant to the terms of his\n\nrelease, Col\u00f3n violated another supervised release condition when\n\nhe failed to stay at his address of record (his mother's house).\n\nAfter being called out for moving out, Col\u00f3n returned to his mom's\n\nplace, but he didn't stay put long:     Two days later, probation\n\nreported, he'd again moved out without notice.       In response,\n\nprobation successfully requested an arrest warrant, and local\n\nauthorities searched the place where Col\u00f3n was thought to be\n\nresiding.    During the search, officers found under Col\u00f3n's bed a\n\nloaded AR-style rifle with 30 rounds of ammunition along with an\n\nextra magazine loaded with an additional 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nCol\u00f3n admitted ownership of the rifle, nonchalantly observing to\n\n\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fthe officers \"that he liked rifles.\"            The search team also found\n\npresumptive synthetic marijuana1 and rolling paper in his car.\n\n            A federal grand jury indicted Col\u00f3n on a single count of\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, which generally proscribes certain\n\ncategories of people from possessing firearms or ammunition. Col\u00f3n\n\nwaived   his    preliminary   revocation       hearing      for   the    supervised\n\nrelease violations and on the new charge pleaded guilty to being\n\na felon in possession of ammunition (60 rounds) pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement.2\n\n            The parties proposed in the plea agreement an advisory\n\nguidelines calculation that started with a base offense level of\n\n22, minus three levels for acceptance of responsibility, and\n\ndetermined a total offense level (TOL) of 19.                     And the parties\n\nalso agreed they'd each request a sentence within the to-be-tallied\n\nguidelines     range   for   the   TOL   of    19    when   combined      with   the\n\nundetermined Criminal History Category (CHC).                 The PSR landed on\n\n19 as the TOL, too, then laid out Col\u00f3n's criminal history,\n\nincluding      his   Commonwealth-side        drug    conviction        (possessing\n\ncontrolled substances and drug paraphernalia) and the federal drug\n\nconviction     (conspiracy    to   possess     with    intent      to   distribute\n\n\n     1 The record does not reflect that this substance was ever\ntested and confirmed to be synthetic marijuana.\n     2 The parties agree the agreement's waiver-of-appeal provision\n\ndoes not operate as a bar to this appeal since the provision was\nconditioned on the district court sentencing Col\u00f3n to a term of 46\nmonths' imprisonment or less -- which condition is not met here.\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fnarcotics).    These tabulations dictated a CHC of IV, and, together\n\nwith the TOL of 19, yielded a guidelines sentencing range of 46 to\n\n57 months' imprisonment.\n\n            Each side then filed a sentencing memorandum in support\n\nof its recommended sentence (a low-end 46 months from Col\u00f3n; a\n\nhigh-end 57 months from the government) in anticipation of the\n\nupcoming hearings.\n\n                           The Sentencing Hearings\n\n            Before the district court in February 2022, the first\n\nsentencing matter taken up was Col\u00f3n's new criminal case (the\n\nammunition-possession indictment).          Counsel for Col\u00f3n started with\n\nsome objections to the PSR, two of which are relevant to today's\n\nanalysis.     First, counsel argued the district court should append\n\nto the PSR a psychometric evaluation filed by the expert who'd\n\nexamined Col\u00f3n at defense counsel's request and assessed his\n\nintellectual disability; the district court agreed to do so.              That\n\nmatter squared away, counsel next argued that because the PSR's\n\ndrug-use section described Col\u00f3n's historically heavier use of\n\nsubstances,    the   PSR    impermissibly    suggested   that,   during    his\n\nrelease period, Col\u00f3n had been using more than just the marijuana\n\nto which he'd twice tested positive.              The court signaled in\n\nresponse that it would consider these points in sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\f            Moving to her argument proper, Col\u00f3n's counsel offered\n\nthe following in support of the recommended low-end 46-month\n\nsentence.\n\n            Stating what those in the sentencing world should take\n\nas a given, counsel set the stage by pointing out that the\n\nsentencing court must \"make[] an individualized assessment . . .\n\nof Col\u00f3n\" when pronouncing sentence.            To that end, counsel urged\n\nCol\u00f3n's offense was not a violent one -- it was possession only,\n\nand   his   offense   could    be   explained    by    Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability, which was a big part of why, counsel explained, \"the\n\ncards have always been stacked against\" Col\u00f3n.                That disability\n\nrendered Col\u00f3n -- who has an IQ equivalent to a third-grade\n\neducation, is especially susceptible to peer pressure, and cannot\n\nread or write -- unable to appreciate the amount of ammunition\n\nloaded into the magazines, and his disability also prompted his\n\ncomment that he likes guns.          Drawing on all of this and more,\n\ncounsel beseeched the court to balance this information against\n\nthe need to deter and promote respect for the law when crafting an\n\nindividualized sentence of imprisonment for his non-violent crime.\n\n            The government, on the other hand, sought a 57-month\n\nterm of imprisonment plus a term of supervised release.                      In\n\nsupport,    the   government   submitted    that      Col\u00f3n   \"needs   to   take\n\nindividual responsibility for his actions,\" part of which would be\n\nan acknowledgment that the rifle he possessed while on release\n\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\fwasn't just any gun, it was a \"ghost gun\" (so called because guns\n\nof that variety have no identifying information, such as a serial\n\nnumber) loaded with 30 rounds of ammunition, suggesting he \"was\n\nready to use the rifle if he needed it.\"             The government also\n\npointed to Col\u00f3n's conduct as \"part of a broader [drug-use]\n\nproblem\" -- the government cited his use of \"approximately 25\n\nmarijuana cigarettes per day\" as well as \"daily\" use of Xanax,\n\nPercocet, and Klonopin, not to mention his admission to probation\n\nthat he sometimes mixed prescription drugs and marijuana with\n\nalcohol use.     And, in the government's telling, Col\u00f3n didn't have\n\na history of seeking mental health treatment, instead opting to\n\n\"channel[]\" his anxiety and anger into \"destructive\" activities.\n\n              Citing its review of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\n\nPSR, sentencing memoranda, and a document the court construed as\n\nCol\u00f3n's allocution, the court turned to its own take on sentencing.\n\nThe   court    listed   then-30-year-old   Col\u00f3n's    \"history   of   using\n\nmarijuana and Percocet and Xanax pills without prescriptions,\" and\n\nthat he \"has never received treatment\" for his complained-of\n\nanxiety.       The court noted the fact that Col\u00f3n was found in\n\npossession of a ghost AR loaded with a high-capacity magazine with\n\n30 rounds of ammo, plus another magazine with the same ammo loaded\n\ninto it (though, the court noted, Col\u00f3n was charged and pled guilty\n\nonly to possession of 60 rounds of ammo).            \"[H]e liked rifles,\"\n\nthe court observed.     Concluding the parties' recommended sentences\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\fdid not reflect the seriousness of this offense, address the need\n\nfor     deterrence    and      punishment,      acknowledge        the   import     of\n\nprotecting the public, or promote respect for the law, the district\n\ncourt     pronounced      an     upwardly       variant     66-month         term   of\n\nimprisonment, plus a 3-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Col\u00f3n's      counsel       objected    to     the      above-guidelines\n\nsentence as unreasonable \"given the fact history of [Col\u00f3n]\" and\n\nthe consideration of his historical drug use as part of the\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) factors assessment (given \"there was a difference of his\n\ndrug use,\" past versus more recent).\n\n            Immediately on the heels of that part of the hearing\n\n(same lawyers, same judge, same transcript -- no break in the\n\naction) came the final revocation hearing, where Col\u00f3n's counsel\n\nnoted that his Grade B violation advisory guidelines range was 4\n\nto 10 months, then requested a lower end sentence of 4 months'\n\nimprisonment to run concurrently with the just-imposed criminal-\n\ncase sentence.       For its part, the government requested a high-end\n\n10-month sentence.\n\n            The court revoked the 2017 supervised release term and,\n\nciting    its   review      of   the    guidelines'       policy    statements      on\n\nsupervised release, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \"the seriousness of\n\n[the]    violation,\"     and     noting   Col\u00f3n    \"demonstrated         a   lack   of\n\ncommitment and respect to the supervision process, as well as a\n\ndisregard to the law, by constantly engaging in the illegal use of\n\n\n                                        - 9 -\n\fcontrolled substances,\" the court imposed a 10-month sentence to\n\nrun consecutive to the new-criminal-case sentence, followed by a\n\n5-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Col\u00f3n's counsel requested reconsideration of \"the length\n\nof the sentence\" and urged that it should run concurrently with\n\nthe new-criminal-case sentence.                 Counsel said the aggregate 76-\n\nmonth sentence was quite substantial -- particularly with this\n\nbeing    Col\u00f3n's       first    revocation.        \"Denied,\"      was    the    court's\n\nresponse.\n\n            This timely consolidated appeal followed.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n            Col\u00f3n's appeal levels a multifaceted challenge at the\n\nprocedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentences imposed\n\nby the district court.              Before we dive into any of the arguments\n\nhe makes in support of that challenge -- or any of the government's\n\nresponses thereto -- we first lay out some preliminary method-of-\n\nreview guideposts and the reviewing lens we'll be using to examine\n\nCol\u00f3n's asseverations.\n\n            It     is    axiomatic       that     our   \"review    of    a     criminal\n\ndefendant's      claims        of    sentencing    error   involves       a    two-step\n\npavane.\"    United States v. Miranda-D\u00edaz, 942 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2019).     This two-step framework is well established.                       Under it,\n\n\"we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally\n\nreasonable       and    then        determine   whether    it     is    substantively\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\freasonable.\"    United States v. Clogston, 662 F.3d 588, 590 (1st\n\nCir. 2011).    At both steps, preserved claims of error get abuse-\n\nof-discretion review, see United States v. D\u00edaz-Lugo, 963 F.3d\n\n145, 151 (1st Cir. 2020), and, as part of that review, we look at\n\nfindings of fact for clear error and scrutinize questions of law\n\nde novo, see United States v. Carrasquillo-Vilches, 33 F.4th 36,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2022).\n\n           Today, we start (and will end, as it turns out) with\n\nCol\u00f3n's procedural-reasonableness claims.        And we need train our\n\nfocus on only some of those claims, not all, to reach our outcome.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Torres-Mel\u00e9ndez, 28 F.4th 339, 340\n\n(1st Cir. 2022) (taking the same approach and nodding to the adage\n\nthat \"the 'simplest' way to handle a case is often the 'best' way\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Cruz-Ramos, 987 F.3d 27, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2021))).\n\n           Specifically, we'll take on Col\u00f3n's contentions that the\n\nsentencing court committed error:     (1) in pronouncing sentence in\n\nthe new criminal conduct case when it failed to justify and\n\nadequately explain its upwardly variant sentence, which dovetails\n\nwith what Col\u00f3n says was the court's failure to engage with the\n\nmitigating    individual   characteristic   of   Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability, which was the primary sentencing argument the defense\n\nadvanced; and (2) in erroneously finding during the revocation\n\n\n\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fsentencing that Col\u00f3n was \"constantly engaging in the illegal use\n\nof controlled substances\" \"through his supervision period.\"\n\n          We   take   these   arguments,    and   the   government's\n\nprotestations to them, in turn, applying the just-recapped abuse-\n\nof-discretion framework -- despite the government's argument that\n\nwe should don a different reviewing lens.     We'll explain briefly\n\nwhy we reject the government's request.\n\n          Pointing, for instance, to what it characterizes as\n\nCol\u00f3n's counsel's failure to object below with specificity to\n\nthings like the sentencing court's balancing of the sentencing\n\nfactors or the adequacy of the sentencing rationale, the government\n\nposits that not all of Col\u00f3n's appellate contentions were preserved\n\nfor our abuse-of-discretion review.     The government submits that\n\nwe should instead deem some arguments waived for failure to map\n\nthem onto the resulting (and demanding) plain-error rubric or, at\n\nbest, review those arguments for plain error.\n\n          \"For a defendant '[t]o preserve a claim of procedural\n\nsentencing error for appellate review, [their] objection need not\n\nbe framed with exquisite precision.'\"      United States v. Reyes-\n\nCorrea, 81 F.4th 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2023) (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting United States v. Rivera-Berr\u00edos, 968 F.3d 130, 134 (1st\n\nCir. 2020)).   \"It must, however, 'be sufficiently specific to call\n\nthe district court's attention to the asserted error.'\"          Id.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 12 -\n\f(quoting United States v. Soto-Soto, 855 F.3d 445, 448 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2017)).\n\n           Having carefully studied the sentencing transcript in\n\nits   totality,   we    conclude     it    is    contextually    clear   defense\n\ncounsel's objections sufficiently called the district court's\n\nattention to the perceived sentencing problems that now form the\n\nbasis of the appellate arguments we're about to tackle.                  Counsel\n\nurged that the new-criminal-case sentence was unreasonable given\n\nCol\u00f3n's \"fact history\" -- looking at things holistically, that\n\nobjection clearly is a callback to the comprehensive arguments and\n\nurgings   Col\u00f3n's      counsel   had      infused   into   the   hearing,    thus\n\nsufficiently encompassing and preserving the argument that the\n\ndistrict court ignored the mitigating history and characteristics\n\nand didn't adequately explain its \"above-guidelines sentence.\"\n\nAnd after the revocation sentencing, during which the district\n\ncourt referred to Col\u00f3n's \"constant[]\" use of drugs \"through his\n\nsupervision period\" in pronouncing sentence, counsel's reaction\n\nwas to protest the length of that sentence, it running consecutive\n\nto    rather   than     concurrent        with   the   other     sentence,   the\n\nsubstantiality of the aggregate sentence, and the fact that Col\u00f3n\n\nhadn't gotten all the help he really needed during the short time\n\nhe'd been on release.       And, of course, we also know that, at the\n\nvery outset of the hearing, counsel had objected to the PSR's\n\ncharacterization of Col\u00f3n's drug use historically versus while on\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fsupervised   release;    counsel   argued    these    same   clarifications\n\nseveral times throughout the hearing.3\n\n           This is not a situation where we are faced only with a\n\nrecord that reflects a general objection to a sentence. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Ahrendt, 560 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir. 2009) (deeming an\n\nargument   on   appeal   unpreserved    because      an   appellant    \"never\n\nobjected to the particular issues\" he raised on appeal -- his\n\n\"generic objections [could not] be fairly interpreted as giving\n\nnotice to the court\" as to those specific issues).             Instead, the\n\nthematic protestations and objections here rather bleed together\n\nand certainly operated to make the district court aware of the\n\ndefense's claimed errors.    See, e.g., Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th at 10\n\n(finding \"[s]ubsumed within\" a party's objections \"the clearly\n\nimplicit charge that the district court's explanation rested on\n\nimproper   considerations\"    (quoting      United    States   v.     Serrano-\n\nBerr\u00edos, 38 F.4th 246, 250 n.1 (1st Cir. 2022))).            Requiring more\n\nof defense counsel here would be unwarranted.             What actually got\n\n\n\n\n     3 We also note that when Col\u00f3n's counsel objected to the\ndistrict court's reliance on the PSR's characterization of Col\u00f3n's\nhistory of drug use when announcing the 66-month sentence, the\ncourt remarked, \"I don't think it's a good idea for you to say\nthat I should not indicate what his past drug use has been,\" and\nindicated it might rescind its recommendation that Col\u00f3n\nparticipate in a beneficial drug treatment program if his counsel\npursued that argument further. Given the court's response, Col\u00f3n's\ncounsel cannot be faulted for deciding not to trot out the same\njust-rejected objection only minutes later at the conclusion of\nthe revocation sentencing.\n\n\n                                   - 14 -\n\fsaid is well in line with our preservation policy (basically,\n\nputting the district court on notice of the error).   See Holgu\u00edn-\n\nHern\u00e1ndez v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 762, 766 (2020) (\"The\n\nquestion is simply whether the claimed error was 'brought to the\n\ncourt's attention.'\" (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b))); Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 51(b).\n\n          Thus, on this record, abuse-of-discretion review it is.\n\nNow, we turn to the appellate contentions and the precedential\n\nlandscape against which they appear in this case.   First, the new-\n\nconduct sentence; then, the revocation sentence.\n\n                  New Criminal Conduct Sentence:\n         The Sentencing Explanation and Mitigating Factors\n\n          As we mentioned earlier, we need tackle only some of\n\nCol\u00f3n's various appellate attacks.      Namely, we review Col\u00f3n's\n\ncorrelated attacks on the adequacy of the court's explanation for\n\nits upward variance in the new criminal conduct case and its\n\nfailure to address the mitigating evidence of Col\u00f3n's intellectual\n\ndisability.4   But we'll lay out the particulars of these arguments\n\n\n\n\n     4 We note right off the bat that, \"[g]enerally speaking, it\nis not abundantly clear whether failure to consider mitigating\nfactors goes to the procedural or substantive reasonableness of a\nsentence.\" United States v. Santiago-Lozada, 75 F.4th 285, 295\nn.11 (1st Cir. 2023). And \"[t]he lack of an adequate explanation\ncan be characterized as either a procedural error or a challenge\nto the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\" United States\nv. Crespo-Rios, 787 F.3d 34, 37 n.3 (1st Cir. 2015). Col\u00f3n focuses\nthese arguments on procedural error, and we follow suit.\n\n\n                               - 15 -\n\fafter   we    provide    a   sampling       of   the   wide      world    of   pertinent\n\nsentencing considerations that animates our coming analysis.\n\n                                      The Primer\n\n              When it comes to what a court must do when pronouncing\n\nsentence, our jurisprudence has seen quite the evolution.                              See\n\nUnited States v. Flores-Gonz\u00e1lez, 86 F.4th 399, 417-25 (1st Cir.\n\n2023) (Thompson, J., joined by Barron, C.J. and Montecalvo J., for\n\na divided en banc court) (tracking and studying in detail the\n\nhistory      and    progression       of   federal     sentencing        precedent     and\n\nparameters).         Specific to the adequacy of a court's explanation\n\ngrounding a variance from the guidelines range, here are the\n\nbasics.\n\n              Federal law requires a sentencer to \"state in open court\n\nthe reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\"                             18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); see also Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 46,\n\n50-52 (2007).        Just what kind of explanation is needed depends on\n\nthe context of each individual case, Rita v.

When     a   court      imposes    a    sentence      above   the\n\nguidelines         sentencing   range,        \"it    must       justify     the   upward\n\n\n                                           - 16 -\n\fvariance.\"        United States v.

Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th 48, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2021).\n\n          We do not require sentencing courts to deliver a \"rote\n\nincantation\" of each factor, and we do not expect them to apply\n\nequal weighting across factors.       See United States v. Dixon, 449\n\nF.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).         We likewise do not require a\n\nsentencing court to \"address every argument that a defendant\n\nadvances in support of his preferred sentence.\"         United States v.\n\nRivera-Morales, 961 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2020).        When a sentencing\n\ncourt explicitly notes that it considered all the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\nfactors, we will take that into consideration.         Clogston, 662 F.3d\n\nat 592 (observing that when a district court says it considered\n\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \"[s]uch a statement 'is entitled to some\n\nweight'\" (quoting United States v.

And, when it isn't readily apparent in as\n\nmany words, we sometimes are able to infer that a sentencing court\n\nweighed relevant factors in explaining its pronouncement.

Flores-Nater, 62 F.4th 652, 656 (1st Cir. 2023) (\"[W]e\n\nhave not mandated that a sentencing court follow any particular\n\nformat in explaining an upwardly variant sentence.

Ruperto-Rivera, 16 F.4th 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2021).\n\n           With this legal backdrop in place, we move on.\n\n                              The Arguments\n\n           As we've previewed, Col\u00f3n's attack on the reasonableness\n\nof the court's pronounced sentence for his new conduct goes like\n\nthis:     The court erred by failing to consider or address the\n\nmitigating   impact   of    his   intellectual    disability   and,   quite\n\nrelatedly, the court did not provide an adequate explanation for\n\nthe upward variance.       Col\u00f3n all along has presented one principal\n\nmitigating characteristic argument -- his intellectual disability\n\nmitigates his culpability for his new criminal conduct (and the\n\nsupervised release violations) in that, for example, it made him\n\nsusceptible to being pulled into the criminal activities and\n\nconspiracies in which he was embroiled.             He points out that,\n\ndespite    consistently     arguing   this   mitigating    characteristic\n\nthroughout the sentencing proceedings, the court did not address\n\nit at all in its sentencing decision.            While recognizing, as we\n\nhave outlined above, that a sentencing court is not required to\n\naddress every factor or every argument in making its sentencing\n\ndecision, Col\u00f3n argues that in his case, the court here cannot\n\nhave adequately explained its upwardly varying sentence when it\n\n\n                                   - 19 -\n\ffailed to even mention his disability or the well documented impact\n\nit has had on his life (remember the self-mutilation).\n\n            The government relies generally on the fact that the\n\nsentencing court enjoys wide discretion in its consideration of\n\nthe sentencing factors and chalks Col\u00f3n's argument up to being a\n\ncomplaint about how mitigating factors were weighed, pointing out\n\ntoo that the court didn't need to address every argument Col\u00f3n\n\nmade.   It submits that, because the district court was obviously\n\nvery aware of Col\u00f3n's disability (the government points, for\n\ninstance, to the district court telling the parties it had read\n\nand considered Col\u00f3n's sentencing memorandum, where his disability\n\nwas highlighted in detail), its decision simply reflects that it\n\nconsidered and rejected the defense argument that the mitigating\n\nfactor of Col\u00f3n's disability warranted a lower sentence.             The\n\ngovernment    contends     the   district   court's   explanation   was\n\nsufficient because it focused on the offense conduct and relevant\n\naggravating factors not included in the guidelines calculation to\n\nsupport the upward variance (like the loaded rifle -- a ghost gun,\n\nremember).\n\n                                 Our Take\n\n            Col\u00f3n's challenge has merit.    As we'll lay out, on this\n\nrecord, the district court's explanation was problematically thin,\n\nand   its   failure   to   consider   expressly   Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability as a mitigating characteristic -- not just one of many\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\fmitigating   arguments   below,    but     the   principally   highlighted\n\nargument below -- ultimately compels our conclusion that its\n\nexplanation of the upwardly variant sentence was thus inadequate.\n\n          As a refresher, the court's sentencing colloquy went\n\nlike this.   First, the court recited some basic facts about Col\u00f3n\n\nand his case (his age, offenses, history of drug use, the gun --\n\nmore on this in just a moment).            Then, it observed that Col\u00f3n\n\n\"requested a sentence of 46 months\" while the government sought \"a\n\nsentence of 57 months.\"    But it reasoned \"that neither sentence\n\nreflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the\n\nlaw, protects the public from additional crimes by Mr. Colon, nor\n\ndoes it address -- do they address the issues of deterrence and\n\npunishment.\"   And then it levied its upwardly variant sentence.\n\n          On its face, this boilerplate language is insufficiently\n\nindividualized and it is inadequate -- on its own -- to explain\n\nthe upwardly variant sentence.      See, e.g., Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th\n\nat 10-11 (collecting some recent examples of similarly inadequate\n\nboilerplate \"explanations\").        \"[I]t simply rehearses -- but,\"\n\nemphasis ours, it \"does not apply -- certain of the factors that\n\nCongress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences.\"\n\nId. at 11 (quoting Flores-Nater, 62 F.4th at 656, which in turn is\n\nciting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)).\n\n          But what else was said? This matters because, as already\n\nmentioned, we readily acknowledge that sometimes a sentence can be\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fdeemed adequately explained by drawing \"fair inference[s] from the\n\nsentencing record.\"       Id. (quoting Montero-Montero, 817 F.3d at\n\n38).   However, \"while 'a court's reasoning can often be inferred\n\nby comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the\n\npre-sentence report with what the judge did,' such inferences must\n\nbe   anchored   in    'what   the   judge    did.'\"     United    States    v.\n\nCarrasquillo-S\u00e1nchez, 9 F.4th 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.\n\n2006)); see also Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th at 55.\n\n           Having acknowledged that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\nfactors, PSR, and sentencing memoranda, and after laying out the\n\nfacts of Col\u00f3n's offenses, the court also mentioned:             Col\u00f3n's age,\n\n10th grade education, and employment info; his history of using\n\nmarijuana as well as non-prescription Percocet and Xanax; his\n\nhistory of anxiety but never getting treatment for it; that he was\n\nfound with ammunition and a loaded \"ghost AR 15-style assault rifle\n\nwith no serial number\"; and that he told probation that \"he liked\n\nrifles.\"\n\n           In addition to the idea that perhaps this list of\n\nconsiderations could help explain the sentencing rationale, there\n\nis also an argument to be made -- and the government makes it --\n\nthat the mention of the loaded ghost gun (\"difficult, if not\n\nimpossible,\"    the   court   noted,   for   law    enforcement    to   trace)\n\nexplains the court's variant sentence.             As the government tells\n\n\n                                    - 22 -\n\fit,   the   sentencing   court    identified    these      main   factors   as\n\njustification for the variance, with its rationale hinging on being\n\nvery troubled by the loaded ghost gun and extended magazine, not\n\nto mention Col\u00f3n's comment that he likes guns. In the government's\n\nview, all of this is plenty from which we could infer an adequate\n\nsentencing rationale, particularly when the extent of the variance\n\nis so slight at \"only 9 months\" of extra imprisonment.\n\n            Color us unpersuaded.        For one thing, as a general\n\nmatter, we disagree with the characterization of this upward\n\nvariance as insignificant.       See Rosales-Mireles v. United States,\n\n138 S. Ct. 1897, 1907 (2018) (Sotomayor, J.) (reasoning, in another\n\nsentencing context, that \"'[t]o a prisoner,' th[e] prospect of\n\nadditional    'time   behind     bars   is    not   some    theoretical     or\n\nmathematical concept[,]'\" and \"'any amount of actual jail time' is\n\nsignificant\" (first quoting Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474, 504\n\n(2010) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); then quoting Glover v. United\n\nStates, 531 U.S. 198, 203 (2001))).          And as a practical matter, 9\n\nmonths, which represents, for example, the length of an entire\n\nschool year or a full-term pregnancy, would readily be understood\n\nas a significant time period by any reasonable measure.\n\n            Moreover, the court's statements do not constitute an\n\napplication of the factors or an adequate explanation -- this is\n\nanother \"mere listing of the facts\" that has no \"emphasis on any\n\nparticular circumstance,\" and thus it is \"impossible to tell\" what\n\n\n                                  - 23 -\n\fthe court's rationale was for landing on this 9-month upward\n\nvariance -- 15% up from the guidelines sentencing range.       Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Mu\u00f1oz-Fontanez, 61 F.4th 212, 214 (1st Cir. 2023)\n\n(vacating a 20% upward variance there).   What we have here, once\n\nagain, is the court rehashing some basic identifying information\n\nand the facts that formed the basis of the new-conduct charge that\n\nled to the instant need for sentencing. See Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th\n\nat 11; id. at 11-12 (\"A summary of the events that preceded the\n\n[sentencing] hearing -- without more -- is an impermissible basis\n\nfor a large upward variance.\").\n\n          We need to be able to understand the reasons of the\n\ndistrict court and how it arrived at its sentencing pronouncement:\n\n\"When imposing a significant variance, a sentencing court must\n\nmake clear which specific facts of the case motivated its decision\n\nand why those facts led to its decision.\" Mu\u00f1oz-Fontanez, 61 F.4th\n\nat 215; see also Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th at 13 (\"If the court deemed\n\nthe number of revocations, Reyes's behavior, or some other aspect\n\nof the record uniquely unacceptable, it should have so stated.\").\n\nWe grant that we certainly can conceive of different ways a ghost\n\ngun being in the factual mix (when the gun possession isn't already\n\nencompassed by the guidelines) could affect sentencing.     We can\n\neven (speculatively) conceive of specific ways the ghost gun in\n\nthis case might've impacted the sentencing court's analysis.   But\n\nour point here is that we do not know which reasons -- if any --\n\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fwere       actually   what   the    sentencing     court     had    in    mind   when\n\npronouncing sentence.        The point, indeed, is that the court didn't\n\nsay.       See Gall, 552 U.S. at 50 (instructing that sentencing courts\n\nmust offer \"adequate[]\" explanations \"to allow for meaningful\n\nappellate       review   and       to   promote    the     perception      of    fair\n\nsentencing\").\n\n               Now, it is not sufficiently clear to us that the court's\n\nmention of the ghost gun connects the necessary inferential dots\n\nto reveal a strong justification for the variance.                       But even if\n\nenough \"fair inferences\" could carry the day here to divine a\n\nghost-gun-anchored       justification      that     would   pass    muster,5     see\n\nFlores-Nater, 62 F.4th at 656 (noting that it is sometimes possible\n\nfor us to draw inferences from the sentencing record in concluding\n\nthat a district court adequately explained a variance), another\n\nproblem with the court's sentencing explanation looms: its failure\n\nto mention, let alone engage with, Col\u00f3n's intellectual disability\n\nas a mitigating characteristic.             The conspicuous absence of any\n\nmention of that characteristic smacks of a failure to make an\n\nindividualized assessment of Col\u00f3n.               We explain.\n\n\n\n\n       Given where we land analytically today, we need not and do\n       5\n\nnot make any per-se judgment as to the impact possession of a ghost\ngun ought to have on a sentencing calculus. As always when it\ncomes to fashioning a sentence, the role of any given fact -- ghost\ngun or otherwise -- in any given sentencing record should be\ncarefully assessed individual case by individual case.\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\f            Some   distinctions   are   helpful   as    a    starting   point.\n\nCol\u00f3n's case is not one in which the district court quite clearly\n\naddressed certain things, but an appellant nonetheless complains\n\nit did not, see, e.g., Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th at 52 (rejecting a\n\ndefendant's argument that the court failed to consider mitigating\n\nfactors of his youth and prior clean record when the court had\n\nexpressly    mentioned    both),6     and    (despite       the   government's\n\nsuggestion to the contrary) it is similarly unlike the related\n\nclass of cases where a defendant attempts to superimpose his own\n\npreferred weighing of the sentencing factors, see, e.g., Ruperto-\n\nRivera, 16 F.4th at 6 (rejecting a mitigating-factors challenge\n\nwhen the appellant's \"plaint boil[ed] down to a lament that the\n\ncourt did not weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors as\n\ncounsel would have preferred\").         Col\u00f3n's case is likewise unlike\n\nthose where a defendant trains his gaze on a sentencing court's\n\nfailure to address one of his arguments -- when our caselaw is\n\nclear that, in fact, it need not \"address every argument that a\n\ndefendant advances in support of his preferred sentence.\"               Rivera-\n\nMorales, 961 F.3d at 19 (emphasis added).\n\n\n     6 Additional examples for the curious reader:      Cahill, 85\nF.4th at 625 (rebuffing a defendant's claim of error as to the\ndistrict court's dismissal of multiple mitigating factors he'd\nargued when the court \"expressly consider[ed] those factors\"); and\nRuperto-Rivera, 16 F.4th at 6 (finding a court \"dealt explicitly\nwith\" a rehabilitation mitigation argument and therefore rejecting\na defendant's accusation that the court had disregarded that\nmitigating factor).\n\n\n                                    - 26 -\n\f           Col\u00f3n's case stands apart from these types of appeals\n\nfor the simple reason that he isn't complaining about how a bunch\n\nof important mitigating factors were discarded or weighed wrong;\n\nhe isn't arguing that some of his arguments were given short shrift\n\nor misunderstood.     His position is that the mitigating individual\n\ncharacteristic and the argument about it were completely ignored.\n\nAnd on this record, he has a point.\n\n           True, the district court here stated that it considered\n\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors.     And while we give \"some weight\" to that\n\nstatement, D\u00e1vila-Gonz\u00e1lez, 595 F.3d at 49 (citing United States\n\nv. Morales-Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 26 (1st Cir. 2008)), we still\n\nmust decide whether the court applied the factors reasonably.\n\n           We conclude the court fell short in this regard.           This\n\nis because it is nose-to-face plain from the record that the\n\ndistrict court never engaged with Col\u00f3n's intellectual disability\n\nas   a   mitigating   characteristic.        Col\u00f3n's    steadfast   theory\n\nthroughout the sentencing proceedings was that his intellectual\n\ndisability    affects    sentencing     at   many      levels,   including\n\nculpability, deterrence, and recidivism -- counsel all but jumped\n\nup and down to call attention to all of this.          Yes, we are mindful\n\nthat the court didn't need to address every argument raised, nor\n\ndid it need to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in any particular way.\n\nBut \"[t]he relative weight of each factor will vary with the\n\nidiosyncratic circumstances of each case,\" Dixon, 449 F.3d at 205,\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fand on this record, given Col\u00f3n's paramount emphasis on this\n\nindividual           characteristic      as     the   mitigation    argument,   it    is\n\nreasonable to conclude that the sentencing court should have\n\nengaged with it, see, e.g., Rita, 551 U.S. at 357 (teaching that\n\nwhen       a    party      \"presents    nonfrivolous     reasons     for   imposing   a\n\ndifferent sentence,\" sentencing courts should \"explain why [the\n\ncourt          is]   reject[ing]       those    arguments\"    --    \"[s]ometimes     the\n\ncircumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they\n\nwill       call      for    a   lengthier       explanation,\"      but   \"[w]here    the\n\n[sentencing court] imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines, the\n\n[court] will explain why [it] has done so\" (emphasis added)).                        See\n\nalso United States v. Robles-Alvarez, 874 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2017)          (deeming     a   sentence       unreasonable     when,    \"despite    the\n\nappellant's repeated attempts\" to get the sentencing court to\n\nconsider a \"potentially forceful [sentencing] argument,\" the court\n\n\"fail[ed] to even mention the [sentencing] issue\" and \"did not\n\neven provide a cursory explanation for its rejection of his\n\nargument\").7\n\n\n\n       In a footnote, the government tells us Robles-Alvarez is\n       7\n\nneither here nor there because the facts there were unique since\nthe appellant was sentenced to life in prison while his\ncoconspirators received significantly lesser sentences, 874 F.3d\nat 52, and \"Col\u00f3n's case does not fit within [this] unique\nframework.\"   All sentencing cases' facts are unique -- that is\nprecisely the point of our sentencing jurisprudence that requires\nindividualized assessment of each and every defendant to be\nsentenced. That said, and as Col\u00f3n points out, we see quite a few\npertinent similarities between Robles-Alvarez and the instant\n\n\n                                            - 28 -\n\f          As for possible inferences here, we run headlong into\n\nthe issue we canvassed above -- the court did not say enough from\n\nwhich we could fairly infer how it felt about Col\u00f3n's dominant\n\nmitigation argument.    The government argues the district court\n\n\"acknowledged\" the argument by noting that it had reviewed the\n\nPSR, sentencing memos, and expert report that raised the mitigating\n\ncharacteristic.   But on this record, it is simply a bridge too far\n\nfor us to say the district court meaningfully considered, let alone\n\nadequately   explained,     how   Col\u00f3n's    specific   individual\n\ncircumstances impacted the final sentencing decision.    Rita, 551\n\nU.S. at 356 (instructing that sentencing courts must say enough to\n\nshow an appellate court they \"considered the parties' arguments\").\n\nSame goes for how the ghost gun fits into any of this, i.e.,\n\nwhether the court's recitation of information about the ghost gun\n\ncould suggest the court determined that fact and its attendant\n\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating characteristic of Col\u00f3n's\n\ndisability -- the court did not say, and there is insufficient\n\nrecord material to permit such an inferential leap.\n\n\n\n\nmatter (both defense sentencing memos focused on a mitigating\nfactor to argue for a lower sentence, that argument was a primary\nfocus at the sentencing hearing, and the sentencing court said\nnothing about the argument when pronouncing sentence). Id. The\nfact that the substance of the ignored \"potentially forceful\"\nargument might differ from case to case does not alter our\nreasoning today.\n\n\n                              - 29 -\n\f           Here's where all of this leaves us:          The district court\n\nabused its discretion as it relates to the sentencing imperatives\n\nof individualized review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the adequacy\n\nof the explanation for its upwardly variant sentence.\n\n      Revocation Sentence: \"[C]onstantly engaging\" in drug use\n                  \"through his supervision period\"\n\n           Our remaining task is to examine Col\u00f3n's contention that\n\nthe   district   court   erroneously       found   during   the    revocation\n\nsentencing   that,   \"through    his   supervision    period,\"      Col\u00f3n   was\n\n\"constantly engaging in the illegal use of controlled substances.\"\n\nAccording to Col\u00f3n, this finding is clearly erroneous -- recall\n\nfrom many pages ago that the record reflects that Col\u00f3n tested\n\nnegative   for   cannabinoids    fifteen     times   during   his    release,\n\notherwise testing positive only twice (in December 2019 and June\n\n2020, and for cannabinoids only) in the 14-month testing window.\n\nCol\u00f3n notes that the PSR certainly (and misleadingly, he says)\n\ndelved into his historical and more consistent abuse of harder\n\ndrugs, but that prior use in no way reflected Col\u00f3n's behavior\n\nduring his supervised release period.          Col\u00f3n also points out that\n\nat the sentencing hearing the government may have further muddied\n\nthe waters by using the present tense to describe his prior drug\n\nuse   --   stating   that   he   \"smokes    approximately     25    marijuana\n\ncigarettes per day . . . as well as taking Xanax, Percocet, and\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 30 -\n\fKlonopins on a daily basis\" and that he \"mixes the prescription\n\ndrugs and . . . marijuana with . . . alcohol.\"\n\n           The government's rebuttal is that the record supports a\n\nconclusion that the district court was well aware Col\u00f3n had only\n\ntwo positive tests, but also knew Col\u00f3n missed a drug test and\n\npurported synthetic marijuana and rolling paper were found in his\n\ncar when he was arrested.      The court had before it the PSR and\n\ndefense counsel's many arguments about it.            So, the government\n\nsays, the district court fully appreciated the evidence of Col\u00f3n's\n\ndrug use during his supervised release, and its statement about\n\n\"constant[]\" use \"is best characterized as an inartful slip of the\n\ntongue.\"\n\n           \"[S]electing   a   sentence   based   on   clearly   erroneous\n\nfacts\" is an example of a \"significant procedural error,\" United\n\nStates v. Navarro-Santisteban, 83 F.4th 44, 55 (1st Cir. 2023)\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51), and such\n\nan error \"warrant[s] 'revers[al] unless the government shows the\n\nmistake did not affect the sentence,'\" id.

But \"[c]lear-error review is demanding:       this\n\nstandard will be satisfied only if, upon whole-record-review, an\n\ninquiring court forms a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake\n\nhas been made.\"   United States v.

The record evidence shows the only time\n\nCol\u00f3n \"constantly\"8 used drugs was years earlier (back when he\n\nsmoked 25 joints a day and took Xanax, Percocet, and Klonopin\n\n\n      8\"Constantly\" is defined as \"without variation, deviation,\nor change\" and \"with regular occurrence.\"     Constantly, Merriam-\nWebster      Online       Dictionary      (Jan.      5,      2024)\nhttp:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/constantly\n[https:\/\/perma.cc\/T6XX-METW]; see also Constantly, Oxford English\nDictionary          Online         (Jan.          5,         2024)\nhttps:\/\/www.oed.com\/dictionary\/constantly_adv?tab=meaning_and_us\ne&tl=true#8389233      [https:\/\/perma.cc\/E7NX-T3LM]      (defining\n\"constantly\" as \"[i]nvariably, uniformly, regularly, in every\ncase, always\"; \"[c]ontinually, perpetually, incessantly, always\").\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\fdaily, sometimes even mixing prescription drugs with alcohol).\n\nThe government does not dispute this; it just insists the district\n\ncourt was well aware that Col\u00f3n's past use was just that -- past\n\n-- because the court indicated that it had read Col\u00f3n's objections\n\nto the PSR and Col\u00f3n's counsel labored to clarify the PSR's\n\nfreewheeling narrative of Col\u00f3n's drug use.               This would be a\n\nreasonable reading of things but for what the court actually said\n\nwhen imposing the revocation sentence.         The court quite clearly\n\nstated (emphases are ours) that Col\u00f3n's drug use \"through his\n\nsupervision period\" was \"constant[].\"         We cannot reconcile that\n\ncharacterization with what the record actually reflects, nor are\n\nwe willing to chalk it up to \"an inartful slip of the tongue\" as\n\nthe government suggests we should.\n\n            To the extent the district court was drawing inferences\n\nto find the drug use during Col\u00f3n's term of supervised release was\n\nconstant, that approach meets the same clear-error fate.                  A\n\n\"constantly\" using inference is wholly implausible on this record\n\nbecause there are no adequately supported facts to permit it.\n\nInstead, what the record clearly reflects is that fifteen of\n\nseventeen   tests   came   back   negative,   the   two    positives   (for\n\ncannabinoids only, remember) were 6 months apart, Col\u00f3n had been\n\nengaged in his drug treatment program, and the presumptive pot\n\nfound in Col\u00f3n's car was never even tested.                 These are not\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\f\"constantly\" using facts, nor do they even approach a set of facts\n\nthat would permit such an inference.\n\n            And so, either reading of the district court's finding\n\nwould yield the same clear-error conclusion for us.\n\n            Resisting this conclusion and trying to show us any\n\nmistake    in   this     regard   didn't   affect   Col\u00f3n's       sentence,     the\n\ngovernment reasons that the court's reliance on the drug tests\n\nwasn't an instance of the proverbial tail wagging the dog since\n\nthe tests were just one of several violations the court relied on\n\nwhen imposing sentence.           True enough, the court had before it\n\nevidence of Col\u00f3n's other violations.           But on this record, we do\n\nnot know precisely to what degree the court relied on its erroneous\n\nconstant-use fact, whether based on a misunderstanding of the\n\nrecord or extrapolated from the record, in fashioning the resulting\n\nsentence.       See,     e.g.,    Navarro-Santisteban,       83    F.4th   at    56\n\n(remanding when it was not possible to \"extricate the influence\"\n\nof the court's erroneous reliance on tainted hearsay evidence \"from\n\nthe   court's   broader     sentencing     rationale\").       We    thus   cannot\n\nconclude    that   the    procedural    error   here   did    not    affect     the\n\nselection of the imposed sentence.9\n\n\n\n\n      9Before we go, a quick word on the Bureau of Prisons' 500-\nhour drug and alcohol treatment program, which was recommended by\nthe court as part of Col\u00f3n's sentence. The government suggests\nthe court mentioned these past-drug-use facts so Col\u00f3n could\nbenefit from the 500-hour program.    This doesn't track for the\n\n\n                                     - 34 -\n\f                            CONCLUSION\n\n            We vacate Col\u00f3n's sentence and remand to the district\n\ncourt for resentencing consistent with this opinion.   In light of\n\nthis disposition, we leave untouched and intimate no view on\n\nCol\u00f3n's other appellate challenges to his sentences.   On remand,\n\nthe parties may pursue the other issues raised in their briefs we\n\nneed not reach today, to the extent those other issues remain\n\nrelevant.\n\n            The Clerk of the District Court is directed to assign\n\nthis case to a different judge on remand for prompt resentencing.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; see also United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1995) (remanding to a different judge where the\n\noriginal sentence was grounded on unsupported findings of fact);\n\n\n\n\nrevocation sentence rationale. For one thing, the court mentioned\nthe 500-hour treatment program much earlier in the sentencing --\nfor the new conduct, not as part of the revocation sentence\nrationale. For another, the court could've referred Col\u00f3n to the\n500-hour program without stating he \"constantly\" used drugs during\nhis supervision period -- or it could have been more clear that it\nwas saying so for the purpose of anchoring the order for the\ntreatment program (though again, this still doesn't square with\ncharacterizing Col\u00f3n's prior use as \"constant[]\" use \"through his\nsupervision period\"). What's more, the record bears out that the\ntreatment program may have been ordered because the defense imbued\nits sentencing arguments with the importance of substance abuse\ntreatment (of note, defense counsel below suggested Col\u00f3n might\nnot qualify specifically for the 500-hour program because it\nrequires a GED (which Col\u00f3n does not have); and even then, we note\nthere is no guarantee the Bureau of Prisons will be able to\naccommodate such a referral).\n     All to say, this point does not move the analytical needle\nfor us.\n\n\n                              - 35 -\n\fMawson v.

Sept. 18, 2023).\n\n     Hood was arrested and charged after the effective date of Public Act 101-652 (eff. Jan. 1, 2023),\n\n     commonly known as the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act (Act). 1\n\n\n\n             1\n              \u201cThe Act has also sometimes been referred to in the press as the Pretrial Fairness Act. Neither\n     name is official, as neither appears in the Illinois Compiled Statutes or public act.\u201d Rowe v. Raoul, 2023 IL\n     129248, \u00b6 4 n. 1.\n\f     No. 1-23-1808B\n\n     For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64           Hood was charged by indictment with one count of the Class 2 felony of aggravated battery\n\n     of a peace officer, 720 ILCS 5\/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2022), and one count of criminal trespass to\n\n     land, 720 ILCS 5\/21-3(a)(2) (West 2022). At an October 4, 2023 hearing, he was granted pretrial\n\n     release with standard conditions,2 the requirement to report to the Adult Probation Department\u2019s\n\n     Pretrial Services Division and ordered to refrain from going to a local high school.\n\n\u00b65           Pursuant to section 5\/110-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) (725 ILCS\n\n     5\/110-6 (West 2022)), the State filed a petition for revocation of pretrial release. The petition\n\n     alleged that while on pretrial release in the instant case, Hood was charged with a new felony,\n\n     armed habitual criminal (AHC), 720 ILCS 24-1.7(a) (West 2022). The State asserted that \u201cno\n\n     condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the appearance of\n\n     [Hood] for later hearings [and] prevent [Hood] from being charged with a subsequent Felony or\n\n     Class A Misdemeanor.\u201d\n\n\u00b66           The court conducted a hearing on the petition on October 23. The State proceeded by\n\n     proffer, explaining that:\n\n                      \u201cthe case that\u2019s before you is case No. 23CR1095601. On that case, he is charged\n\n             with an aggravated battery to a police officer. The facts are that on October 3rd of 2023,\n\n             officers were dispatched to a fight between juveniles at North-Grand High School located\n\n             at 4338 West Wabansia Avenue.\n\n                      Officers approached the juveniles to break up a fight. One of the juveniles was\n\n             [Hood\u2019s] stepdaughter. [Hood] was on scene. And as the police approached [Hood\u2019s]\n\n\n             2\n               These conditions are to: appear in court, submit to the orders of the court, not violate any criminal\n     statute of any jurisdiction, and file a written notice within 24 hours after a change of address.\n\n                                                           2\n\fNo. 1-23-1808B\n\n       stepdaughter, [Hood] stepped in and interfered. He began pulling his stepdaughter away\n\n       from the police officer, and [Hood] then pushed Officer Pagan with two hands in the chest.\n\n       He was wearing full Chicago Police Department uniform and acting in his official duties\n\n       on that day.\n\n              ***\n\n              And at the time he also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43.\n\n              Judge, then [Hood] was again arrested October 19th. Officers responded. Officers\n\n       were dispatched to a call of a person trespassing at Harris Ice, located at 3927 West Fifth\n\n       Avenue.\n\n              ***\n\n              The caller described [Hood]. He was wearing acid washed jean jacket, sunglasses,\n\n       black hoodie, gray jeans and a baseball cap. Officers were also notified from the caller that\n\n       [Hood] was armed with a handgun.\n\n              He was in that location attempting to take dry ice from the business; however, he\n\n       then fled that location, and officers observed [Hood] matching the description that was\n\n       provided by the caller and placed [Hood] into custody and conducted a protective\n\n       pat-down, and officers then recovered a semi-automatic 45-caliber handgun with blue\n\n       finish\u2014it was loaded\u2014from [Hood]\u2019s left jacket pocket.\n\n              [Hood] was then relocated to the Harris Ice location and was positively identified\n\n       by the caller. [Hood] did not have a valid FOID or Concealed Carry License, and he was\n\n       previously convicted of a 2020 possession of a firearm\u2014excuse me, felon in possession of\n\n       a firearm.\u201d\n\nThe State expounded on Hood\u2019s criminal background, explaining he had a 2015 conviction for\n\naggravated battery in a public place, a 2012 conviction for manufacture or delivery of heroin, a\n\n                                                3\n\f     No. 1-23-1808B\n\n     2011 conviction for manufacture or delivery of cannabis, and a 2019 misdemeanor conviction for\n\n     domestic battery. The State indicated that at the time Hood was arrested in the instant matter, he\n\n     also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43. Hood was currently being detained on the\n\n     AHC charge. Further, the court had at its disposal the public safety assessment from pretrial\n\n     services which indicated that Hood (1) scored a 6 out of 6 on the \u201cnew criminal activity scale,\u201d\n\n     indicating that he was at the highest risk of reoffending, and (2) had three prior violent convictions.\n\n     Accordingly, the State argued that there were no set of conditions that would allow Hood to comply\n\n     with the Court\u2019s orders and prevent him from \u201cpicking up\u201d any further criminal cases.\n\n\u00b67          Defense counsel argued the petition should be denied and stated that Hood had complied\n\n     in the instant matter with reporting to pretrial services. Counsel further argued that Hood was\n\n     present at the school to pick up his stepdaughter, who is one of three children living with Hood\n\n     and his pregnant girlfriend. During the incident at issue, he was attempting to protect his\n\n     stepdaughter, who was on the ground after the police officer had separated two minors involved\n\n     in an altercation. In other mitigation, counsel argued that Hood is 42 years old, has been working\n\n     in refrigeration for several years, takes classes, and has an older daughter in college that he\n\n     supports. Further, Hood has attended Garfield Community Church for 10 years, where he\n\n     participates as a mentor in the youth camp program. Lastly, counsel informed the court that Hood\n\n     has some mental health diagnoses, for which he is currently taking medication.\n\n\u00b68          The court granted the State\u2019s petition for revocation of pretrial release, noting that Hood\n\n     had been charged with a Class X felony while on pretrial release for aggravated battery to a peace\n\n     officer. The court further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that no condition or\n\n     combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent Hood from being charged with a\n\n     subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor. Accordingly, the court ordered Hood to be detained\n\n     by the Cook County sheriff. On November 2, Hood filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                                       4\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b69                                                II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10           On appeal, Hood argues the trial court erred when it revoked his pretrial release because\n\n       electronic monitoring (EM) was sufficient to prevent him from committing any new offenses. The\n\n       State counters that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Hood\u2019s pretrial release\n\n       where the court found that Hood was charged with a subsequent felony while on pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case.\n\n\u00b6 11           In considering this appeal, this court has reviewed the following documents which Hood\n\n       and the State have submitted under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023): (1)\n\n       Hood\u2019s notice of appeal pursuant to the Act, (2) the supporting record, (3) Hood\u2019s supporting\n\n       memorandum, and (4) the State\u2019s response to Hood\u2019s memorandum.\n\n\u00b6 12                                          A. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 13           We initially note that the parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review. Hood\n\n       contends the standard of review is de novo, where the court considered only documentary\n\n       evidence. Nonetheless, Hood argues, reversal is required under any standard of review. The State\n\n       argues the applicable standard regarding revocation of pretrial release is abuse of discretion. We\n\n       agree with the State. To our knowledge, the appropriate standard of review for revocation of\n\n       pretrial release under section 5\/110-6 of the Code has not been directly addressed by any appellate\n\n       or supreme court opinion. See People v. Reed, 2024 IL App (4th) 231074-U, \u00b6 22; People v. Smith,\n\n       2023 IL App (1st) 231756-U, \u00b6 23. However, as noted recently by a panel of the fourth district,\n\n                       \u201ceven in those jurisdictions adopting a mixed standard of review of a circuit court\u2019s\n\n               pretrial release decision under section 110-6\/1, where, as here, the State must meet its\n\n               burdens by \u2018clear and convincing evidence,\u2019 court\u2019s acknowledge \u2018[t]he trial court\u2019s\n\n               pretrial release determination, modification of pretrial release determination, or revocation\n\n               of pretrial release determination will not be reversed unless the determination was an abuse\n\n                                                         5\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n              of discretion.\u2019 People v.

Sept. 18, 2023) have historically been reviewed using an abuse of\n\n       discretion standard. People v. Inman, 2023 IL App (4th) 230864, \u00b6 10. While Illinois Supreme\n\n       Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023) provides a new procedure for these types of appeals, \u201cthe\n\n       Act neither mandates nor suggests a different standard of review.\u201d Inman, 2023 IL App (4th)\n\n       230864, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b6 15          \u201cA defendant appealing under Rule 604(h) may claim the State failed to fulfill its burden\n\n       by \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 See Ill. S. Ct. R. 604(h)(1)(iii) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023). However,\n\n       we are not reviewing the State\u2019s evidence anew.\u201d Id. Rather, we review the circuit court\u2019s\n\n       evaluation of that evidence for an abuse of discretion, as \u201ca court\u2019s decisions regarding whether\n\n       the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that release conditions would not protect the\n\n       community is inextricably linked to any decision to grant or deny pretrial release.\u201d People v. Jones,\n\n       2023 IL App (4th) 230837.\n\n\u00b6 16          We believe the standard of review should be no different here, and therefore we apply an\n\n       abuse of discretion standard. An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court\u2019s \u201c \u2018ruling is\n\n       arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by\n\n       the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d In re Marriage of Heroy, 2017 IL 120205, \u00b6 24 (quoting Blum v.

Revocation of Pretrial Release\n\n\u00b6 18           Pursuant to the Code, \u201cit is presumed that a defendant is entitled to release on personal\n\n       recognizance on the condition that the defendant shall attend all required court proceedings and\n\n       the defendant does not commit any criminal offense, and complies with all terms of pretrial\n\n       release.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/110-2(a) (West 2022). It is the State\u2019s burden to prove by clear and\n\n       convincing evidence that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably\n\n       ensure the appearance of the defendant for later hearings or prevent the defendant from being\n\n       charged with a subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/110-6(a) (West 2022).\n\n       Upon such a showing, the trial court may order a defendant detained if the defendant is charged\n\n       with a qualifying offense and the circuit court concludes the defendant poses a real and present\n\n       threat to the safety of any persons or the community. 725 ILCS 5\/110-6.1(a)(1-7) (West 2022). If\n\n       the court finds that detention is not appropriate, it can impose additional conditions as it deems\n\n       necessary. 725 ILCS 5\/110-10(b) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 19           If previously granted, \u201cpretrial release may be revoked only if the defendant is charged\n\n       with a felony or Class A misdemeanor that is alleged to have occurred during the defendant\u2019s\n\n       pretrial release after a hearing on the court\u2019s own motion or upon the filing of a verified petition\n\n       by the State.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/110-6(a) (West 2022). During a revocation hearing,\n\n       the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the nature and\n\n       seriousness of the violation or criminal act alleged.\u201d Id. If the court decides that revocation is not\n\n       appropriate, it \u201cmay release the defendant pre-trial, with or without modification of conditions of\n\n       pretrial release.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 20           For the following reasons, we do not believe the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n       determining that there were no conditions or combinations of conditions that could have prevented\n\n                                                         7\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n       Hood from being charged with a subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor. The record\n\n       demonstrates that the court relied on the fact that\u2014while on pretrial release in this case\u2014Hood\n\n       was arrested and charged with AHC, a Class X felony. As a condition of his pretrial release, Hood\n\n       was required to, inter alia, not violate any criminal statute of any jurisdiction. The trial court\n\n       specifically found that Hood was on pretrial release for case 23 CR 10956 when he allegedly\n\n       committed a Class X felony (case 23111321801), a mere two weeks after the instant offense\n\n       occurred. The record supports this conclusion. While Hood argues he complied with his pretrial\n\n       release restrictions, he points only to his compliance with the conditions that he report to pretrial\n\n       services and stay away from his stepdaughter\u2019s high school. He does not acknowledge his failure\n\n       to refrain from violating any criminal statute.\n\n\u00b6 21           Hood contends the court could have sufficiently minimized any risk he had of reoffending\n\n       by employing EM as a condition of release. Hood offers no more than a conclusory statement that\n\n       \u201c[b]ecause Jeffrey had not been previously placed on electronic monitoring (EM) and did not have\n\n       an apparent history of failures to appear, the State did not show that no conditions of release could\n\n       reasonably ensure his appearance.\u201d Further, Hood emphasizes the same mitigating factors\n\n       provided at his revocation hearing\u2014his role as a caretaker for his children and pregnant girlfriend,\n\n       his employment, his involvement in church, and the fact that he was taking classes. But none of\n\n       the mitigating factors Hood relies upon previously prevented him from violating his pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case when he was arrested for a serious felony. The State proffered clear and\n\n       convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably\n\n       prevent Hood from being charged with yet another subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n       Given Hood\u2019s criminal history, it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful for the trial court to\n\n       agree with the State. Consequently, we cannot say the circuit court erred when it revoked Hood\u2019s\n\n       pretrial release.\n\n                                                         8\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b6 22                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 23          Following a thorough review of the record on appeal, for the reasons stated, we find the\n\n       court did not err when it revoked Hood\u2019s pretrial release. The mandate in this case shall issue\n\n       immediately. See People v. Gil, 2019 IL App (1st) 192419, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 24          Affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 25   JUSTICE OCASIO III, dissenting:\n\n\u00b6 26          I respectfully dissent from the decision revoking Jeffrey Hood\u2019s pretrial release. As the\n\n       majority correctly recognizes, the State bore \u201cthe burden of proving, by clear and convincing\n\n       evidence, that no condition or combinations of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the\n\n       appearance of the defendant for later hearings or prevent the defendant from being charged with a\n\n       subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/110-6(a) (West Supp. 2023). One of the\n\n       conditions of release contemplated by the new pretrial-release provisions is that the defendant be\n\n       placed on \u201cpretrial home supervision *** with or without the use of an approved electronic\n\n       monitoring device.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/110-10(b)(5) (West Supp. 2023). Hood argues that the trial court\n\n       erred by jumping straight to revocation rather than ordering home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring as a condition of his release. The majority rejects this argument as conclusory, but that\n\n       gets it backwards: Hood did not have the burden of showing that home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring was adequate; the State had the burden of showing that it was not. The facts proffered\n\n       by the State showed that both the underlying charge and the new charge that prompted the\n\n       revocation hearing involved alleged offenses that took place in public, not in the home. The State\u2019s\n\n       proffer included no information indicating that home confinement with electronic monitoring\n\n       would not reasonably ensure that Hood committed no further crimes. In the absence of any\n\n       indication that home confinement with electronic monitoring was either unavailable or inadequate\n\n       under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s finding that the State had met its burden by\n\n                                                        9\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n       clear and convincing evidence is arbitrary and unreasonable. I would therefore find that the trial\n\n       court abused its discretion.\n\n\u00b6 27          The trial court failed to articulate the reasons for its decision. At the end of the revocation\n\n       hearing, the Court stated:\n\n                          \u201cThe defendant on the case before me has a pending case, and\n                      this Court finds that based on a petition from the State requesting\n                      revocation and based on what I have heard in the hearing that the\n                      defendant, while on pretrial release, did, in fact, pick up a new\n                      charge of armed\u2014I believe it's armed habitual but I want to make\n                      sure that's the correct charge\u2014armed habitual criminal, which is a\n                      Class X felony, while on bond for this aggravated battery to a peace\n                      officer, and that it occurred while on his pretrial release.\n                          The Court further finds that by clear and convincing evidence\n                      that no condition or conditions at this moment release would be\n                      reasonable to prevent him from being charged with another\n                      subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n                          It is therefore ordered that the defendant's pretrial release in this\n                      case be revoked and he be remanded to the Cook County Jail under\n                      further order of this Court.\u201d\n\n       The court\u2019s written revocation order is a form with checkboxes. It adds nothing to what was said\n\n       in open court, and it provides no insight into why the court determined there were no conditions\n\n       or combinations of conditions for ensuring that he would not be charged with another offense. In\n\n       short, the record shows us that the trial court found that the standard for revocation had been met,\n\n       but it does not tell us either why or how. Without an explanation for why the court found as it\n\n       did, we cannot conduct a \u201cmeaningful review of its exercise of discretion.\u201d People v. Ortega,\n\n       209 Ill. 2d 354, 360 (2004).\n\n\u00b6 28          Furthermore, as a matter of procedural fairness, the accused is entitled to an explanation as\n\n       to why a judge has ordered him to be detained. A statement of reasons is a requirement of\n\n       procedural due process at proceedings to revoke parole and probation even after a defendant has\n\n       been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Morrisey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972);\n\n                                                         10\n\fNo. 1-23-1808B\n\nGagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973). I cannot fathom why revocation of pretrial\n\ndetention, at which time the accused is still cloaked with a presumption of innocence, would not\n\nrequire at least as much. See State v. Burgins, 464 S.W.3d 298, 310 n.7 (Tenn. 2015). Indeed, this\n\ndue-process protection is expressly provided for in the statute that governs denials of pretrial\n\nrelease. When entering a detention order, the statute requires the trial court to explain in writing\n\nits \u201creasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied pretrial release, including why less\n\nrestrictive conditions\u201d would not be adequate. 725 ILCS 5\/110-6.1(h)(1) (West Supp. 2023).\n\nWhether that provision also governs revocation proceedings is an open question that we have not\n\nbeen asked to answer in this appeal. But even if it does not, the defendant still has a right to know\n\nwhy the trial court found as it did. In my view, due process of law\u2014not to mention fundamental\n\nfairness\u2014requires no less.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f","Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. (2024). In The People of the State of Illinois, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Edwin Quintero, Defendant-Appellant. 2024 IL App (1st) 2129-U, No. 1-23-2129B. \n\nThis report discusses a case presented in the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. The judgment was delivered by Justice Oden Johnson and concurred by Justices C.A Walker and Tailor. The case concerns the plaintiff, The People of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, Edwin Quintero. The final judgment was filed on January 18, 2024, under the Supreme Court Rule 23. The judgment is not considered a precedent except under specific conditions indicated by Rule 23(e)(1).\n\nThe defendant, Edwin Quintero, through his attorney, filed an appeal under the Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023). The appeal challenged the trial court's order issued on September 28, 2023, as per the Pretrial Fairness Act. The defendant was accused of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing leading to damage above $300, and aggravated assault of a peace officer using a motor vehicle.\n\nThe defendant's attorney indicated that the trial court abused its discretion as it claimed that no condition or a combination of conditions could mitigate the defendant's willful flight. However, the court did not articulate clear alternative restrictions or specify why those proposed alternatives would not reduce the defendant's likelihood of willful flight.\n\nThe court hearing revealed that on September 27, 2023, police officers received notification of a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was intercepted but did not stop until it crashed and got stuck between a wall and a light pole. The defendant, reportedly the driver, attempted to escape but was apprehended a short distance away. The defendant later confessed to knowing that the vehicle was stolen but denied trying to hit the police officer.\n\nIn his defense, the defendant's attorney argued that the defendant was a 19-year-old lifelong resident of Chicago. His mother and pregnant fianc\u00e9e, with whom he had a child, were present in court during the hearing. The defendant had completed three years of high school, earned a food handling certificate, and was employed as a dishwasher at a restaurant.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the trial court decided in favor of the state's petition to detain the defendant based on the defendant's risk of willful flight and denied him pretrial release. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on October 5, 2023, and a Rule 604(h) memorandum, and the state filed a memorandum in response.\n\nThe judgment of the court was later reversed and remanded for the reasons stated in the report.","The appeal case of K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc. vs. The Western Surety Company et al. was made known in the Court of Appeal of the State of California, particularly the Third Appellate District in San Joaquin, bearing the case numbers C096705 and C097987. This court action originates from the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, with case number STK-CV-UCC-2017-0011949, which decision was delivered by Judge Jayne Chong-Soon Lee. The appeal was filed by K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc., with Downey Brand, Matthew J. Weber, Alexandra K. LaFountain, and Jennifer L. Williams representing the plaintiff. \n\nOn the defendants' side, The Western Surety Company et al., they were represented by Brunn & Flynn, Gerald E. Brunn, John K. Peltier, and Drexwell M. Jones. The judgment from the Superior Court was affirmed by the appellate court. Furthermore, K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc. filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court, which was ultimately denied. \n\nIn addition to the denial of the petition for rehearing, a modification was made to the opinion filed on January 2, 2024. At the end of the last paragraph of part I of the Discussion on page 7, footnote 3 was added. This footnote requires the renumbering of all subsequent footnotes and addresses four points raised by K & S in their petition for rehearing. \n\nFirst, K & S acknowledges that the text of the mechanics\u2019 lien law has changed over time, but argues that the Legislature intended the law to continue covering the same types of claimants mentioned in the older cases. The court, however, finds that K & S cannot obtain the relief it seeks by characterizing itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. \n\nSecondly, K & S interprets section 8024 to define a laborer as both (1) any person who, acting as an employee, performs labor on a project, and (2) any person who bestows skill or other necessary services on a project. However, the court disagrees, asserting that the statute\u2019s plain terms only refer to a \u201cperson who, acting as an employee,\u201d does particular things; it does not include persons who are not acting as employees. \n\nThe third point raised by K & S alludes to Government Code section 68081, where they claim they are entitled to a rehearing because the court interpreted the term \u201claborer\u201d differently than the parties had briefed. However, the court maintains that the cited provision only applies when the court makes a decision based on an \u201cissue\u201d that was not proposed or briefed; in this case, the court based its decision on the very issue and indeed, the very statute that parties raised.\n\nLastly, K&S asserts that they should be granted relief under section 9100, subdivision (a)(1). This provision describes one of the categories of persons who may assert a claim against a payment bond. However, K & S never discussed this particular provision in its initial briefing, nor has it shown that it satisfied the distinct procedural requirements for seeking relief under this provision. Consequently, the court rejects this claim, as it was raised belatedly and without sufficient support. \n\nIn conclusion, the modification made to the opinion does not change the ultimate judgment of the case. The judges who oversaw the case were HULL, Acting P. J., BOULWARE EURIE, J., and MESIWALA, J. The case was officially filed on January 2, 2024, with the aforementioned details and was certified for publication.","Case Citation: SGS SPORTS INC. v. UNITED STATES, Slip Op. 24- (CIT 2024)\n\nIn the United States Court of International Trade, presided by Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves, a case was heard concerning SGS Sports Inc. (the plaintiff) and the United States (the defendant). The case was filed under Court No. 18-00128.\n\nThe parties jointly filed a Stipulation of Facts and Joint Motion for Entry of a Judgment, which was granted by the court. The legal representatives for the plaintiff were John M. Peterson and Patrick B. Klein of Neville Peterson, LLP, New York. The defendant was represented by Justin R. Miller (attorney-in-charge) and Monica P. Triana (Senior Trial Counsel) of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division. Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton and Director Patricia M. McCarthy were also associated with the motion.\n\nThe court had split the case into two phases. In Phase I, it was determined that the warehousing agreement between SGS and 147483 Canada, Inc. constituted a lease or similar use agreement (SGS Sports Inc. v. United States, 47 CIT _, _, 620 F. Supp. 3d 1365, 1380 (2023)). Phase II left to be resolved whether the entries in question were eligible for duty-free treatment under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading 9801.00.20.\n\nThe parties stipulated the following facts:\n\n1. The merchandise under dispute had been previously imported into the United States.\n2. Upon the previous importation, the plaintiff had paid all applicable duties.\n3. While abroad, the imported merchandise had not been advanced in value or improved by any manufacturing process.\n4. The person who reimported the merchandise into the United States was the same person who had initially imported and subsequently exported it.\n\nThe parties argued that these stipulated facts resolved all remaining factual issues and requested a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. While agreeing to the entry of a judgment, the defendant maintained that it did not intend to waive its appeal rights regarding the court's determinations in Phase I of the proceeding.\n\nThe court reviewed the dispute based on USCIT R. 58.1, which allows parties to file a stipulation for judgment on agreed facts at any time while challenging the denial of a protest to the assessment of duties by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The court undertook a de novo review and described the two-step process of resolving classification cases. The first step is to determine the proper meaning of the terms in the tariff provision and the second is to decide whether the subject merchandise falls within the parameters of the tariff provision. The former constitutes a question of law, while the latter is a question of fact. In this instance, the court had already resolved the first step during Phase I of the proceedings, leaving only questions of fact for Phase II.\n\nUnder 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.2, importers generally have to pay duties on goods that were imported into the United States, exported to another country, and then reimported back into the United States. HTSUS subheading 9801.00.20 provides an exception to this rule for merchandise imported into the United States, exported under a lease or similar use agreement, and then reimported into the United States. The HTSUS 9801.00.20 exception is granted when the merchandise is reimported without having been advanced in value.","Unpublished United States Court of Appeals Decision for the Eleventh Circuit\n\nCase No. 23-13500\nOn a Non-Argument Calendar\n\nTommy D. Lay, II, the Plaintiff-Appellant,\nBryon Dawson, a Plaintiff,\nversus\nStorm Smart Building Systems, Inc.,\nThe Defendant-Appellee.\n\nAn appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, D.C. Docket No. 2:20-cv-00746-NPM\n\nBefore WILSON, BRANCH, and LAGOA, Circuit Judges.\n\nJudges' unanimous decision:\nTommy D. Lay, II, acting in his own defense, has appealed the district court's order from September 22, 2023, which granted his counsel's request to withdraw. A jurisdictional question was posed to the parties regarding the nature of our jurisdiction over this appeal. However, the appellee did not comprehend. Upon examining Lay's response to the jurisdictional question and reviewing the record, we must dismiss this appeal due to the lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe order issued on September 22 is not final as all claims against Storm Smart Building Systems, Inc. have not been fully addressed. As per 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; CSX Transp. Inc. v. City of Garden City, 235 F.3d 1325, 1327 (11th Cir. 2000). The stipulations of voluntary dismissal from February 20, 2023, February 24, 2023, and June 20, 2023, are all invalid as they each aim to dismiss a single claim against Storm Smart rather than the entire action. Refer to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a); Esteva v. Ubs Fin. Servs. Inc. (In re Esteva), 60 F.4th 664, 675 (11th Cir. 2023); Rosell v. VMSB, LLC., 67 F.4th 1141, 1144 (11th Cir. 2023). Also, none of the stipulations were signed by all parties who had appeared in the action. Please see City of Jacksonville v. Jacksonville Hospitality Holdings, L.P., 82 F.4th 1031, 1038-39 (11th Cir. 2023).\n\nOpposite to Lay's arguments, the order which grants counsel's request to withdraw is not an immediately appealable injunctive order. Refer to \u00a7 1292(a)(1); Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 424 F.3d 1117, 1128 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v. Bowman, 341 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003). Nor is it instantly appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or the collateral order doctrine. A comparable situation can be found in Richardson-Merrell, Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 440 (1985) where it was concluded that \"orders disqualifying counsel in a civil case are not collateral orders subject to immediate appeal\"; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (requiring a district judge to certify, in writing, an order for immediate appeal under this subsection).\n\nAll pending motions are hereby denied due to them being inconsequential.","The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in its file numbered 22-6049, referenced as McGuire v. Loudon County, et al., involves Devin D. McGuire as the Plaintiff-Appellant and the Loudon County, Tennessee, Loudon County Jail, Jailer Brockwell, Jailer Ward, and Captain Keener as the Defendants-Appellees. The file was officially registered on January 19, 2024, under the clerkship of Kelly L. Stephens. This appeal emanates from a decision made by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.\n\nThe presiding judges over the case were Griffin, Bush, and Larsen, with Larsen being the Circuit Judge who presented the opinion. The plaintiff, who was an inmate at Loudon County Jail, lodged a complaint, stating that his Eighth Amendment rights were infringed upon by the jail and its officers. However, the district court dismissed his case under the stipulations of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A due to a lack of a valid claim. After a thorough review of the facts presented, this appellate court decided to affirm the district court's decision in part, vacate it in part, and remand the case back to the district court for further deliberations.\n\nIn June 2022, Devin McGuire, representing himself (pro se), filed a lawsuit against Loudon County Jail and its correction officers namely, Brockwell, Ward, and Myers, under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, citing excessive force. McGuire utilized a complaint form to initiate his suit. However, this form didn't ask him to specify whether he was suing the defendants as individuals or in their official capacity, and McGuire didn't provide this specification either.\n\nA few days later, McGuire submitted a follow-up letter composed of four handwritten pages. This letter reiterated the allegations against the correction officers outlined in the original complaint and introduced new allegations of excessive force by another officer, Captain Keener, which reportedly took place several days after McGuire had submitted his initial complaint. He attached a copy of his original complaint to the letter but, yet again, failed to specify whether he was suing the defendants in their official or individual capacities.\n\nIn July 2022, McGuire filed another prisoner complaint form, which differed slightly from the first. He named Loudon County instead of Loudon County Jail as a defendant and listed Keener as a defendant based on the second incident narrated in his follow-up letter. Unlike the first form, this complaint form contained check boxes under each defendant's name where the plaintiff could designate \"Individual capacity\" or \"Official capacity\". McGuire checked the individual capacity box for Keener and the official capacity boxes for Blackwell, Ward, and Myers. He attached four handwritten pages titled \"Short Summary and Complaint\" and \"Short Summary\" to this complaint form. In these pages, he reiterated the details of the incidents, indicating his desire to keep his lawsuit progressing.\n\nIn October 2022, McGuire filed yet another prisoner complaint form, this time naming Loudon County Jail, not Loudon County, as a defendant. He also named Keener, Ward, and Brockwell as defendants in their official capacity. Myers was not named in this form. He attached to his filing a one-page handwritten document titled \"Short Summary,\" briefly reiterating the same allegations against the defendants and expressing his desire to check on the progress of his case.\n\nA week later, the district court, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1)), screened his complaint. The court interpreted McGuire's October 2022 filing, which contained the least amount of information, as a motion to amend his complaint. The court granted the motion and solely considered the allegations set forth in that filing. The court then ruled that McGuire had failed to state a claim and dismissed the case. The court reasoned that Loudon County Jail is not considered a \"person\" under \u00a7 1983 and is therefore not subject to liability.","This citation details the proceedings of a legal case filed by the plaintiff, Dr. Lan Yao against Oakland University, which is referred to as the defendant throughout the text. The case was presided over by Circuit Judges GRIFFIN, BUSH, and READLER, with Circuit Judge CHAD A. READLER providing the final judgment. The lawsuit arose following the denial of tenure to Dr. Yao in the nursing school of Oakland University. Dr. Yao alleged that the university had discriminated against her on the basis of race and national origin. Moreover, she contended that the university had taken retaliatory actions against her for filing a workplace complaint.\n\nHowever, the court found these allegations to lack sufficient evidence. No identified employee in a similar position to Dr. Yao had reportedly received more favorable treatment, thus undermining her discrimination claims. Similarly, Dr. Yao was unable to demonstrate a direct correlation between her protected activity and the university's alleged retaliatory actions, rendering her retaliation claim invalid. As a result, the court upheld the previous ruling of summary judgment in favor of the university.\n\nThe tenure process at Oakland University, particularly in its nursing school, was discussed in detail. The university uses a tenure system similar to other higher education institutions, wherein professors serve in term-limited positions before becoming eligible for tenure. The tenure application comprises a dossier documenting the candidate's qualifications, which are then assessed on three criteria: scholarship, teaching, and professional service. Among these criteria, scholarship, particularly critically evaluated publications, holds the most weight. The candidate's published work reflects their contribution to knowledge in a scholarly field.\n\nTwo committees review the tenure application. The first is the Nursing Committee, followed by the Faculty Committee, which uses the candidate's qualifications to make a tenure recommendation to the university. The university's board of trustees, assisted by the provost and president, makes the final tenure determination.\n\nDr. Yao's tenure application journey is outlined in the citation. Originally from China, she was hired as an assistant professor in the nursing school. Following a few years of service, the board approved her reappointment to a final two-year term as an assistant professor, upon completion of which she would become eligible for tenure. Despite the Nursing Committee's support for her reappointment, they noted that she had produced no work for publication. She was strongly advised to submit and publish several empirically-based manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals. However, at the time of her tenure review, she had co-authored only one peer-reviewed article since her reappointment. Consequently, both the Nursing Committee and the Faculty Committee concluded that she had not met the school's criteria for scholarship and research, leading to the denial of her tenure twice.\n\nFollowing the termination of her contract, Dr. Yao filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), citing race and national origin discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She later filed this lawsuit. The district court awarded a summary judgment in favor of the university, concluding that Dr. Yao had failed to demonstrate that she had been treated worse than other non-protected tenure candidates. The court also found that she failed to establish a causative link between her protected activity and the university's alleged retaliatory conduct.","Citation Format: \n\nUnited States of America, Plaintiff - Appellee, v. Eugene Bilal Anderson, Defendant - Appellant. No. 23-1127. UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. January 19, 2024. Not Recommended for Publication.\n\nA. Case Background\n\nIn the case of United States v. Eugene Bilal Anderson (No. 23-1127), presided over by Circuit Judges Julia Smith Gibbons, White, and Thapar, the appellant Eugene Anderson was sentenced to fifty-one months for counterfeiting United States currency. The case was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on January 19, 2024. \n\nIn March 2021, Anderson was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to make and pass counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 1); making counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 2); and passing counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 3). The indictment alleged that Anderson, utilizing numerous printers, a scanner, and a paper cutter, altered legitimate federal reserve notes to display higher face values. These counterfeit bills were then circulated by Anderson and his co-defendants at various businesses in Southwest Michigan, through which they obtained genuine United States currency and other items of value. Anderson confessed to counterfeiting currency for approximately two years following his arrest.\n\nFollowing his arraignment, Anderson pleaded not guilty and was released on a $20,000 appearance bond by the magistrate judge. As part of the conditions for pretrial release, Anderson was ordered to reside at a community correction facility and submit to drug testing and treatment. However, after two months at the facility, he tested positive for drug use and subsequently absconded. Anderson's whereabouts remained unknown for fourteen months until he was apprehended in August 2022 by the police in response to a report of customers attempting to use counterfeit bills at a McDonald's restaurant. Following his arrest, Anderson pled guilty to all three counts of the indictment.\n\nB. Pre-Sentencing and Sentencing\n\nIn preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office compiled a presentence report, which greatly influenced Anderson's appeal. The report noted that due to Anderson's evasion from pretrial supervision, his offense level computation was enhanced by two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and did not include a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Furthermore, in light of a probationary term associated with a 2015 check forgery conviction, Anderson's criminal history score was increased by two points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) for committing the current offenses while under a criminal justice sentence.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Anderson contested only the probation officer's failure to acknowledge his acceptance of responsibility. After hearing both parties' arguments, the district court overruled the objection. Accepting the probation officer\u2019s calculation of a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of VI, the court sentenced Anderson to a 51-month prison term, the maximum possible within the range. The appeal was filed promptly following the sentencing.\n\nC. Appeal\n\nIn his appeal, Anderson raised two main objections to the sentence issued by the district court. His first contention was that the district court made an error in declining to acknowledge his acceptance of responsibility, citing his guilty plea and cooperation in the presentence investigation as evidence of his acceptance. His second objection, discussed later, pertained to the misapplication of sentencing enhancements relating to his obstruction of justice and his offense committed while under a criminal justice sentence.","In the case number 22-6093, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, on January 19, 2024, under the presiding judges BOGGS, GILMAN, and NALBANDIAN, deliberated over the case of Farrell Marcum. Marcum, a defendant with a comprehensive and violent criminal history dating back to 1984, was convicted for shooting a man in the leg on his property in the year 2021. The police discovered a loaded firearm in his residence, resulting in charges for firearm possession as a felon. Marcum pleaded guilty to these charges.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the occurrence date of Marcum's earlier convictions, only two were recent enough to contribute towards his criminal-history points. This placement put him in criminal-history category II according to the Presentence Report. However, the district court, considering his consistent criminal activities over nearly four decades and the high probability of recidivism, decided to move him to category IV.\n\nMarcum was sentenced to 71 months of imprisonment, which falls on the higher end of the adjusted Sentencing Guidelines range calculated for a category-IV offender. This sentence has been contested by Marcum, arguing it is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. The court, however, upheld the sentence, ruling that the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nThe circumstances leading to Marcum's arrest on March 29, 2021, involved him shooting a man in the leg, causing a femur fracture. The victim, who was on Marcum\u2019s property, was trying to leave the premises in his car after being ordered to do so by Marcum. Upon the identification of Marcum as the shooter and his established status as a convicted felon, the police executed a search warrant on his home, leading to the discovery of a loaded 9mm handgun. Consequently, Marcum was charged with and admitted guilt to the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u2013 a felon in possession of a firearm. At the age of 59, Marcum was sentenced by the district court to 71 months of imprisonment.\n\nMarcum\u2019s criminal history is extensive, dating back to 1984 when he assaulted a man in a Cincinnati bar by stabbing him in the throat with a pair of hemostats. He also assaulted a police officer during his arrest. This resulted in less than four years of imprisonment. Within months of his parole, Marcum was convicted of DUI and fined. Two years later, he was arrested again for DUI and fined after resisting arrest from the police.\n\nApproximately two years later, Marcum was involved in an altercation with the police where he rammed his car into a police vehicle and escaped. When pursued, he rammed another police cruiser. This led to a year-long prison sentence, of which he served two and a half months. Upon his release, he was once again convicted of DUI and fined.\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 28, Marcum was sentenced to a year in prison when he attempted to sell Valium tablets to an informant of the Kentucky State Police. He served two months. At the age of 34, he was found guilty in a federal court of firearm possession as a felon. The police discovered him unconscious in a car with three loaded guns in the passenger seat, one of which had been stolen. It was later discovered that Marcum had obtained the stolen gun after assaulting its owner multiple times, forcing him to undress, and stealing his clothes. Marcum was sentenced to 103 months of imprisonment for this crime. He later violated his supervised-release conditions but was not reincarcerated.\n\nIn 2006, Marcum, at the age of 42, was convicted in a state court for evading the police. Two years later, he was found guilty in a federal court for trying to possess and distribute cocaine. For these crimes, he served a total of one day in jail and was given four.\n","Citation Case No. 23-1116\n\nIn the case of the United States vs. Marlen Lavern Stafford, Jr., which was presided over by Chief Judge Sutton, as well as Circuit Judges Clay and Bloomekatz, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, several key events were noted. \n\nIn the case, it was reported that Marlen Stafford Jr. had escaped from a halfway house where he was serving a federal sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Two months after his escape, Stafford was found in a fast-food restaurant by officers who were following him, and they used their patrol cars to block his exit. Instead of surrendering, Stafford aggressively rammed the police vehicles with his own in an attempt to evade capture. He further physically resisted the efforts of seven officers who were trying to subdue him. As a result, Stafford received convictions for felony escape and being a felon in possession of a firearm. His 60-month sentence was challenged on both procedural and substantive grounds, but the court stood by its verdict. \n\nMarlen Stafford is a 31-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and has lived there his entire life. He had a chaotic childhood, bouncing from foster homes to juvenile residential programs. His primary caregivers were his grandmother and his uncle, both of whom have extensive criminal backgrounds. Stafford's criminal history is marked by numerous instances of physically challenging law enforcement and evading capture, with his first adult conviction being for attempting to assault, resist, and obstruct police during a traffic stop. Between 2010 and 2014, he added six more similar offenses to his record.\n\nStafford's conviction under review was a result of another attempted escape and possession of a weapon. In 2020, he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Towards the end of his sentence for this conviction, he was transferred to a residential treatment facility that allowed him to apply for weekend passes to visit his family. However, after leaving to visit his sister on one such weekend, Stafford failed to return to the facility after being asked to leave by his sister. \n\nTwo months after his escape, Stafford was located at a fast-food restaurant by a patrol team. Stafford reacted by ramming his car into the police vehicles blocking his escape for two minutes. This did not work, and he attempted to escape on foot, injuring three of the four officers trying to capture him. He was eventually subdued with the arrival of additional officers. Once under control, Stafford was found to be in possession of a firearm loaded with nine rounds of ammunition. \n\nStafford was indicted on two counts, felony escape, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded guilty to both charges without a plea agreement. Despite the advisory sentencing range of 37 to 46 months, Stafford was sentenced to 60 months. This sentence was contested by Stafford, but the court remained firm in its decision. \n\nIn conclusion, the case of United States vs. Marlen Lavern Stafford, Jr. serves as a stark testament to the escalating nature of criminal behavior and the importance of enforcing consequences for such actions. While the defense made procedural and substantive challenges to Stafford's 60-month sentence, these were ultimately dismissed by the presiding judges, highlighting the seriousness with which the justice system regards repeat and escalating offenses.","NOT SUGGESTED FOR PUBLICATION\nFile Designation: 24a0024n.06\n\nCase Designations: 23-1180\/1183\n\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nSIXTH CIRCUIT                                    FILED\n                                                  January 19, 2024\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                      )           KELLY L.

Moises Jesus Macario-Ramirez pleaded guilty to\n\none count of illegal reentry as per 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and was given a guidelines\n\nsentence of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment at its lower end. Macario-Ramirez now appeals this sentence, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court inappropriately evaluated the\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, giving excessive weight to the negative aspects of\n\nhis criminal history and the need for a sentence of deterrence, while inadequately considering mitigating elements, such as his impoverished upbringing and his role as the sole provider for his family. We, however, find that the district court did not misuse its\n\ndiscretion in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in the case of Macario-Ramirez and hence, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                                             I.\n\nMoises Jesus Macario-Ramirez is a native of Guatemala who has had multiple encounters with the\n\nUnited States immigration system over the past decade due to his undocumented status. Macario-Ramirez migrated\n\nto the United States after experiencing intense poverty in Guatemala. At the tender age of twelve, he\n\nstarted working as a laborer in the fields to assist his family financially. Since his arrival in the United States,\n\nhe has held several jobs to provide for his wife and young child in Indiana as well as for his family back in his home country.\n\nThroughout his stay, Macario-Ramirez has been involved in multiple incidents with law enforcement agencies. Authorities first apprehended Macario-Ramirez when he was nineteen years old in 2010 following suspicion of erratic driving. He failed an on-site sobriety test and confessed to driving under the influence. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to reckless driving and driving without a license.\n\nThe following year, Macario-Ramirez was arrested again after he presented falsified identification papers to the police during a traffic stop. This resulted in two felony charges. Macario-Ramirez failed to attend the preliminary hearing related to these offenses and was subsequently charged with bail jumping. After admitting guilt to each charge, Macario-Ramirez served a two-year prison sentence and was deported to Guatemala in 2015.\n\nDespite his deportation, Macario-Ramirez returned to the United States soon thereafter and continued to accumulate traffic and substance-related offenses. In 2018, for instance, he pleaded guilty to driving without a license following a car accident. In 2020, Macario-Ramirez was arrested for public intoxication at a fashion mall. Following this arrest, it was discovered that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had placed a hold on Macario-Ramirez, and he was subsequently taken into ICE custody. He was then deported from the United States for a second time.\n\nShortly afterwards, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States and was deported for the third time in 2021 after being imprisoned for six months on an illegal reentry charge in Arizona. This charge also resulted in a thirty-six-month term of supervised release for Macario-Ramirez, which prohibited him from committing any further federal, state, or local crimes, and from entering the United States without legal authorization.\n\nDespite these restrictions, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States again in 2022 and was apprehended for his current offense. He was intercepted by customs officers in Port Huron, Michigan.","Citation: Unpublished U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Appeal No. 22-1933, Plaintiffs - Appellants Carl T. Norton & Norhurst Properties Danville, LLC v. Defendants - Appellees Wilkins & Co. Realty, Inc., James Buckner, Edward B. Walker, RE Prospects, LLC, and 2291 Schoolfield, LLC.\n\nThis appeal arises from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, at Danville [Case No. 4:21-cv-00039-TDS-JEP] presided by District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder. The appeal was submitted on November 30, 2023, and the court delivered its decision on January 18, 2024.\n\nThe panel consisted of Circuit Judges Niemeyer and Heytens, along with Senior Circuit Judge Floyd. The judgement was upheld and affirmed through an unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\nLegal representatives for the appellants were J. Chapman Petersen and Won Y. Uh from Chap Petersen & Associates, PLC, located in Fairfax, Virginia. The appellees had various legal representatives; James A. L. Daniel, Khalilah A. Walters, and Michael A. Nicholas from Daniel, Medley & Kirby, PC in Danville, Virginia represented James Buckner. Wilkins & Co. Realty, Inc was represented by Mark E. Feldmann, Sr., and Paul G. Beers from Glenn, Feldmann, Darby & Goodlatte in Roanoke, Virginia. Finally, Harold E. Johnson from Williams Mullen in Richmond, Virginia, and Mark D. Loftis from Woods Rogers Vandeventer Black PLC in Roanoke, Virginia represented Edward B. Walker, RE Prospects, LLC, and 2291 Schoolfield, LLC.\n\nThe case revolves around a real estate transaction involving Carl Norton and Norhurst Properties Danville, LLC as plaintiffs who sued the above-mentioned defendants under the court's diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiffs alleged claims of fraud and civil and statutory conspiracy under Virginia law. \n\nThe appeal was brought forth following the district court's order to dismiss the plaintiffs' action on the grounds of failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). After thorough scrutiny and analysis, the court found no error and therefore affirmed the decision.\n\nThe court's review was de novo, accepting the factual allegations of the complaint as true and interpreting them favorably towards the nonmoving party. Quoting from Rockville Cars, LLC v. City of Rockville, 891 F.3d 141, 145 (4th Cir. 2018), the court stated that to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \n\nThe plaintiffs' fraud claim was addressed first under Virginia law. The plaintiffs needed to allege a false representation of a material fact, made intentionally and knowingly with intent to mislead, and that they relied on this misinformation, resulting in damages (Fessler v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., 959 F.3d 146, 153). However, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' allegations did not amount to a fraud claim as the buyer's identity was immaterial to the transaction and the plaintiffs had disclaimed reliance on the buyer's identity in the purchase agreement.\n\nSimilarly, the court found that the district court was correct to dismiss the plaintiffs' civil and statutory conspiracy claim. As per Virginia law, actions for common law civil conspiracy and statutory business conspiracy can only be considered if the plaintiff sustains damages as a result of an act that is itself wrongful or tortious (Dunlap v. Cottman Transmission Sys., LLC, 754 S.E.2d 313, 317). The court concluded that in this case, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate this.\n\nConsequently, the court upheld the decision of the district court, affirming the dismissal of the plaintiffs' action for failing to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of the specificity and materiality of allegations in stating a claim under federal law.","Case Citation: Gugel v.

The presiding judge over the District Court case was Bruce H. Hendricks, with the case number being 3:21-cv-01444-BHH. The appeal was presented before Circuit Judges Niemeyer and Richardson, and Senior Circuit Judge Keenan.\n\nThe appeal was brought forth by Wayne Gugel, with Dolores Stegelin and Anne H. Rack as plaintiffs, against Pacific Life Insurance Company, with Shurwest, LLC as the defendant. The appeal was submitted on 21st November 2023 and was decided on 18th January 2024. As per the ruling, the court affirmed the initial decision, upholding it without any modifications.\n\nThe appeal was made against the District Court's orders which granted Pacific Life Insurance Company's motion to dismiss, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), Gugel's claims under South Carolina law for aiding and abetting the breach of a fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation. The District Court also denied Gugel\u2019s motions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 15(b).\n\nUpon reviewing the case record and finding no reversible errors in the District Court's rulings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the initial court's orders. It was expressly noted in Gugel v. Pacific Life Insurance Co., No. 3:21-cv-01444-BHH (D.S.C. Mar. 18, 2022 & Dec. 21, 2022) that there was no need for oral argument since the facts and legal contentions were adequately presented in the materials before the court, and it was judged that an oral argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\nNotably, Robert Rikard and Jeremy C. Hodges from Rikard & Protopapas, LLC, Columbia, South Carolina represented the appellant, while J. D. Quattlebaum and Jonathan D. Klett, from Haynsworth Sinkler Boyd, P.A., Greenville, South Carolina; and Todd M. Fuller from Carlton Fields, P.A., Miami, Florida represented the appellee.\n\nIt must be noted that unpublished opinions such as this one are not considered as binding precedent in this circuit. The court, in this case, followed the standard procedure of reviewing the appeal based on the facts and legal contentions presented in the court materials and found that there was no reversible error in the initial court's orders. Consequently, the court affirmed the orders, indicating that the initial court's rulings were upheld, thereby resolving the appeal.","Citation:\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals: Fourth Circuit.

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria. Judge Rossie D. Alston, Jr. (Case No. 1:21-cv-01179-RDA-TCB; 1:21-cv-01123-RDA-TCB) Argued October 25, 2023; Decided January 18, 2024. Presiding Judges: Harris, Quattlebaum, and Bell. Affirmed by published opinion. Majority opinion authored by Judge Harris, joined by Judge Quattlebaum and Judge Bell.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn this case, the court deliberated whether and to what extent money owed under a pre-suit settlement agreement arising from a willful and malicious injury fall within the scope of Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code which excepts from discharge debts for willful and malicious injury to another. While the Bankruptcy Code is created to give debtors a fresh start, there are exceptions to the general rule of dischargeability. The court agreed with the district court ruling that the debts in question in this case are non-dischargeable under Section 523(a)(6) and therefore affirmed the judgment.\n\nThe debtor in question, Lee Andrew Hilgartner, had physically assaulted the plaintiff, Yasuko Yagi, in two separate incidents in 2010. Following these incidents, both parties entered into two agreements that obligated Hilgartner to compensate Yagi for the harm he had caused her. The first agreement described the incidents in detail, with Hilgartner admitting to his violent actions. The agreement required him to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments. However, Yagi did not release her claims, leading to a second settlement agreement years later. The second agreement reiterated Hilgartner's factual and legal responsibility for his infliction. The dispute in this case revolves around whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation for a willful and malicious injury creates a non-dischargeable debt for that injury under Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code and whether debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable under the same section.","In a case pertaining to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling that debts incurred from a pre-suit settlement for willful and malicious injury are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the code. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff Yasuko Yagi and against the defendant Lee Andrew Hilgartner.\n\nThe case is cited as follows:\n\nYasuko Yagi, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

Argued October 25, 2023; Decided January 18, 2024. Before Judges Pamela Harris and A. Marvin Quattlebaum, and Judge Kenneth D. Bell of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, sitting by designation. Affirmed by published opinion. Judge Harris wrote the majority opinion, in which Judges Quattlebaum and Bell joined. James A. DeVita represented the Appellant; Alfredo Acin represented the Appellee. \n\nIn summary, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code typically allows debtors a fresh start by presuming the dischargeability of all legal obligations, no matter how remote or contingent. However, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) enumerates exceptions to this general rule, including \u00a7 523(a)(6), which prevents the discharge of any debt incurred from willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. \n\nIn this case, the defendant Hilgartner had physically assaulted the plaintiff Yagi in 2010. The parties had subsequently entered into two agreements, in which Hilgartner admitted to his violent actions and agreed to compensation payments to Yagi. The first agreement, which is not the main concern of this case, involved Hilgartner admitting to the assault and agreeing to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments. The second agreement, which is central to this case, reiterated Hilgartner's factual and legal responsibility for the harm inflicted on Yagi.\n\nThe issue at hand was whether the settlement agreement that was entered into to avoid litigation over a willful and malicious injury creates a non-dischargeable debt for that injury. Moreover, if it does, the court had to determine whether debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are also non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). The court agreed with the lower court's judgment that these debts are indeed non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). \n\nThis case sets a precedent for future cases involving personal injury settlements and bankruptcy - such debts arising from willful and malicious injury are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, regardless of whether they arise from court judgments or pre-litigation settlements. This interpretation of the law ensures that individuals cannot use bankruptcy as a tool to evade their responsibility for the harm they have inflicted on others.","Citation:\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, Case No. 23-3037. In the matter of Anthony Williams, Petitioner. Petition for Writ of Mandamus from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Related to D.C. No. 5:20-cv-03511. Submitted under Rule 21, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, December 28, 2023. Before Circuit Judges Bibas, Matey, and Chung. Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe case in view pertains to a pro se petition filed by Anthony Williams, the petitioner, for a writ of mandamus. This writ would compel the presiding District Judge to recuse himself from Williams' civil rights action. After careful consideration, the court proceeds to deny the petition for the writ of mandamus.\n\nWilliams had previously lodged a complaint alleging the breach of his constitutional rights. His accusation was based on the assaults and conditions he endured while in prison. The District Court partially granted and partially dismissed the defendants' motion to dismiss Williams' second amended complaint. Following the discovery process, the defendants issued a motion for summary judgment, which is still pending.\n\nIn the time leading up to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Williams filed a motion seeking the District Judge's recusal on the grounds of alleged bias. He claimed the District Judge had denied his motions for sanctions against attorney Lucas Repka for purportedly filing papers on behalf of a deceased defendant, and against Repka and another attorney for allegedly making false claims in a discovery-related filing. Williams also stated his motions to depose the defendants and procure interrogatory responses had been denied, and asserted the defendants had not complied with the discovery orders issued by the Court. \n\nThe District Court denied Williams\u2019 motion for recusal along with several other motions, including a motion for compliance and a motion to extend the discovery deadline. The court observed that the discovery deadline had long since passed and that the defendants had fulfilled their remaining discovery obligations.\n\nWilliams, in response, filed his petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court, asserting that the District Judge's recusal was mandated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) as the District Judge's impartiality could be reasonably questioned. He called for the issuance of a writ that would remove the District Judge and reopen discovery.\n\nTo obtain a writ of mandamus, Williams must demonstrate that he has no other adequate means of redress, that he has a clear and indisputable right to the writ, and that the issuance of the writ would be appropriate under the circumstances. However, Williams' reliance on the District Judge\u2019s denials of his motions and his disagreement with the defendants' compliance with their discovery obligations do not form an adequate basis for the District Judge\u2019s recusal. \n\nWilliams has not shown that he is entitled to relief. His displeasure with the legal rulings does not constitute a valid basis for recusal. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that a reasonable person would conclude that the District Judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Therefore, Williams' mandamus petition will be denied by the court.\n","DLD-054                                                         NOT PRECEDENTIAL\n\n                       UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                            FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                 ___________\n\n                                       No. 23-2782\n                                       ___________\n\n                            UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n                                             v.\n\n                             GREGORY WASHINGTON,\n                                             Appellant\n                       ____________________________________\n\n                     On Appeal from the United States District Court\n                        for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n                     (D.C.

The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm\n\nthe District Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n       Because we recently outlined this case\u2019s procedural history in affirming the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of another \u00a7 3582 motion, see United States v. Washington, No.\n\n22-3264, 2023 WL 2182376, at *1 (3d Cir. Feb. 23, 2023) (per curiam), we do so only\n\nbriefly here. In short, Washington was convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin and\n\nsentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2015, he filed a motion under 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3582 arguing that he was entitled to resentencing under Amendment 782 to the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines. The District Court determined that, while Washington was\n\neligible for resentencing, no decrease to his sentence was warranted based on its\n\nconsideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\n       Washington then filed another \u00a7 3582 motion, raising more arguments concerning\n\nAmendment 782. The District Court determined that the motion was meritless. We\n\naffirmed, concluding that Washington was not entitled to relitigate the District Court\u2019s\n\ninitial denial of relief. See Washington, 2023 WL 2182376, at *2.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       On June 8, 2023, Washington filed the instant motion for compassionate release.\n\nDkt No. 1825. Washington argued that he was entitled to compassionate release based on\n\n(1) a serious health risk due to the spread of COVID-19 and other contaminants; (2)\n\nsufficient rehabilitation; and (3) subsequent changes in applicable sentencing law. The\n\nGovernment responded in opposition. On August 30, 2023, the District Court denied the\n\nmotion, concluding that Washington failed to present extraordinary and compelling\n\nreasons that warrant a reduction, and additionally, may not relitigate arguments denied in\n\nprior motions. Dkt No. 1833. Washington appeals.1\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion a district court\u2019s order denying a motion for compassionate release. United\n\nStates v. Pawlowski, 967 F.3d 327, 330 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201c[W]e will not disturb the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision unless there is a definite and firm conviction that it committed a\n\nclear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant\n\nfactors.\u201d Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). We may take summary action if the\n\nappeal presents no substantial question. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n1\n While there is a question regarding the timeliness of Washington\u2019s notice of appeal, we\nneed not resolve that question to decide this case, for Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(b)(1)(A)\u2019s 14-day appeal period is not a jurisdictional rule, see United States\nv. Muhammud, 701 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir. 2012), and the Government asks us to\nsummarily affirm in lieu of dismissing.\n\n                                             3\n\f       We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. Under\n\n\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), a district court may reduce a prison term if \u201cextraordinary and\n\ncompelling reasons warrant such a reduction.\u201d We conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in concluding that the circumstances presented by Washington did\n\nnot amount to extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying release.\n\n       First, in determining that Washington had not established extraordinary and\n\ncompelling reasons, the District Court reasonably relied on the absence of evidence of\n\nWashington\u2019s alleged health issues and his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broadfield, 5 F.4th 801, 803 (7th Cir. 2021) (reasoning that \u201ca\n\nprisoner who remains at elevated risk because he has declined to be vaccinated cannot\n\nplausibly characterize that risk as an \u2018extraordinary and compelling\u2019 justification for\n\nrelease\u201d). Moreover, we note that, to the extent that Washington relies on generalized\n\nconcerns regarding the institution\u2019s alleged failure to combat the pandemic, these\n\nallegations are insufficient to constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons. See\n\nUnited States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (explaining that \u201cthe mere\n\nexistence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular\n\nprison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release\u201d). This conclusion is\n\nsimilarly true with regard to Washington\u2019s concerns pertaining to the other contaminants\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwhich Washington alleges present a health concern to him; he has failed to present any\n\nevidence to substantiate these claims.\n\n       Second, while Washington has provided evidence of his rehabilitation efforts, the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that rehabilitation alone cannot constitute\n\nextraordinary and compelling grounds under \u00a7 3582, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(t), and he has\n\nnot shown that those efforts combined with his health concerns warrant relief.\n\n       Finally, as we have previously explained, Washington is not entitled to relitigate\n\nthe District Court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim concerning Amendment 782. See\n\nWashington, 2023 WL 2182376, at *2.\n\n       Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f","","","                            2024 IL App (3d) 220517\n\n                          Opinion filed January 19, 2024\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                   IN THE\n\n                       APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                               THIRD DISTRICT\n\n                                     2024\n\nSTOP NORTHPOINT, LLC; BRIAN PODEST;)          Appeal from the Circuit Court\nJOHN LENER JR.; COLEY O\u2019CONNELL; )            of the 12th Judicial Circuit,\nSARAH O\u2019CONNELL; ROBERT HAUERT; )             Will County, Illinois,\nANGEL HAUERT; JOSEPH KINSELLA;         )\nATTILIO MICCI; GERALDINE MICCI         )\nJONES; DOMINIC ORLANDO; TRICIA         )\nMAAS; HARRY HOECHBAUER; GUS            )\nBASELEON; KENNETH HICKEY, By and )\nThrough His Mother and Legal Guardian, )\nSharon Hickey;                         )\nDAN DE CAPRIO; CAROL DE CAPRIO;        )\nROBERT PILLION; ALEJANDRO              )\nGUTIERREZ; WILLARD GUTIERREZ;          )\nKEVIN POMYKALA; JOHN WALKER;           )\nMICHAEL PAMONICUTT; BARBARA J.         )\nWHITFIELD; JOHN VALLRUGO;              )\nJONATHAN JANS; ANDREW KANIVE;          )\nKATHLEEN A.

Original Complaint\n\n\u00b64           In October 2020, Stop NorthPoint, LLC, along with 17 individuals, filed suit to prevent the\n\n     City from annexing, and East Gate from developing, 1262 acres of unincorporated land in Will\n\n     County between the villages of Elwood and Manhattan. Plaintiffs alleged that East Gate\u2019s\n\n                                                      2\n\f     proposed development, an industrial business park (NorthPoint Development) complete with\n\n     warehouses and truck terminals, would constitute a public and private nuisance and that\n\n     defendant\u2019s preannexation agreement providing for the development was null and void. Thereafter,\n\n     plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming 18 additional plaintiffs. They also moved for a\n\n     temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the City from holding two\n\n     hearings scheduled for December 2020 regarding the preannexation agreement. The circuit court\n\n     denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\n\n\u00b65          Defendants executed an annexation and development agreement (annexation agreement)\n\n     following the second December 2020 hearing. The annexation agreement provided that East Gate\n\n     intends to develop a multi-phased light industrial business park on primarily vacant land within\n\n     three miles of two major intermodal facilities. The agreement acknowledged the presence of \u201clittle\n\n     residential property in close proximity to the Property\u201d and stated that the NorthPoint Development\n\n     \u201cis specifically designed to minimize its impact on the surrounding community, and to decrease\n\n     the current amount of truck traffic on Illinois Route 53 and other local roads outside of the park by\n\n     a variety of features described herein, including bridges and a closed loop truck network.\u201d In\n\n     addition to its annexation and zoning provisions, the agreement provided for, inter alia, road\n\n     improvements, a closed loop truck network, sewer and water systems, residential buffers,\n\n     subdivision applications, and community enhancement contributions. It included a \u201ctime is of the\n\n     essence\u201d clause and provided for a 20-year term.\n\n\u00b66                                    B. Second Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b67          In March 2021, plaintiffs filed a 10-count second amended complaint naming 20 additional\n\n     plaintiffs, for a total of 56. Aside from Stop NorthPoint, LLC, which was formed to oppose the\n\n     NorthPoint Development, plaintiffs are primarily military veterans organizations and individuals\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f     (many veterans themselves) who own property or reside in Will County. Some have family or\n\n     friends interred in the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, a national shrine located southwest of\n\n     the proposed development. Some own property near or contiguous to the proposed development.\n\n     The second amended complaint alleges, most notably, that the proposed development will\n\n     constitute a nuisance, the annexation agreement is void, and the City conducted the December\n\n     2020 hearings without proper notice and in violation of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120\/1\n\n     et seq. (West 2020)).\n\n\u00b68          In April 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to\n\n     section 2-619.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5\/2-619.1 (West 2020)). After\n\n     briefing and an oral argument, the circuit court issued a written order in July 2021 granting\n\n     defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, though without prejudice as to any\n\n     specific, identifiable private nuisance claim an individual plaintiff may acquire in the future.\n\n\u00b69          In August 2021, plaintiffs moved to reconsider and, in the alternative, for leave to file a\n\n     third amended complaint. After their motion was fully briefed, plaintiffs learned the City\u2019s plan\n\n     commission intended to hold a public hearing in November 2021 to address an amended\n\n     annexation agreement which plaintiffs believed could moot part of the second amended complaint\n\n     and give rise to new causes of action. Plaintiffs asked the court to stay its ruling on the motion to\n\n     reconsider until after the plan commission\u2019s meeting. The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request and\n\n     ultimately granted plaintiff leave to file a third amended complaint. In December 2021, defendants\n\n     executed the amended annexation agreement following a public hearing. 1 Plaintiffs filed a third\n\n     amended complaint in February 2022.\n\n\n\n\n            1\n              The amended agreement largely retained the provisions of the original annexation agreement as\n     stated in paragraph five of this opinion.\n                                                       4\n\f\u00b6 10                                     C. Third Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b6 11                                       1. Allegations and Exhibits\n\n\u00b6 12           Plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint contains the five counts at issue in this appeal. Counts\n\n       I and II form the gravamen of the third amended complaint. Under those counts, plaintiffs allege\n\n       that, if allowed to proceed, the NorthPoint Development would constitute a private nuisance (count\n\n       I) and a public nuisance (count II). The complaint cites a 2020 traffic impact study commissioned\n\n       by the Village of Manhattan indicating that \u201cat full build-out, the Development will generate an\n\n       additional 10,370 trucks per day.\u201d This figure, plaintiffs allege, is a conservative estimate.\n\n\u00b6 13           In support of their private and public nuisance claims, plaintiffs allege that constant truck\n\n       traffic will (1) cause noise, vibration, pollution, and harm to the environment; (2) interfere with\n\n       the dignity, serenity, and quiet of the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery; (3) endanger\n\n       pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers; (4) generate noxious exhaust and diesel fumes harmful to\n\n       public health and to wildlife, wetlands, and streams; (5) deteriorate streets and necessarily increase\n\n       property taxes to cover repairs; (6) lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and cause constant noise and\n\n       vibrations rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable; (7) produce vibrations likely to\n\n       cause damage to nearby homes, property, and structures; (8) increase plaintiffs\u2019 travel times; and\n\n       (9) lead to a rise in semi-truck crash incidents and collisions with wildlife. Count II additionally\n\n       alleges the proposed development will constitute a public nuisance under the City\u2019s municipal\n\n       code.\n\n\u00b6 14           Count III, brought as a purported taxpayer claim, alleges the new annexation agreement is\n\n       null and void, and unenforceable for vagueness and indefiniteness.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f\u00b6 15          Count IV alleges the November 2021 plan commission hearing was constitutionally\n\n       deficient due to a notice fraught with deficiencies and inaccuracies relating to parcel index numbers\n\n       (PINs), legal descriptions, and acreage.\n\n\u00b6 16          Count V alleges violations of the Open Meetings Act based on the City\u2019s failure to require\n\n       face masks at the November and December 2021 plan commission hearings despite a state-wide\n\n       individual mask mandate and despite the risk that attendees would contract the Omicron variant of\n\n       COVID-19.\n\n\u00b6 17          All counts include a request for (1) a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining\n\n       defendants from developing the proposed industrial business park, (2) a declaratory judgment that\n\n       the annexation agreement is void and the annexation is unlawful, and (3) attorney fees and costs.\n\n\u00b6 18          Plaintiffs attached the following exhibits to their complaint: (1) defendants\u2019 amended\n\n       annexation agreement, (2) a letter to the Village of Elwood from the Department of Veterans\n\n       Affairs-National Cemetery Administration, expressing            concerns about the NorthPoint\n\n       Development, (3) traffic crash reports involving truck drivers causing property damage to the\n\n       Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, (4) a research study finding that older Americans who\n\n       regularly breathe even low levels of air pollution face an increased mortality risk, (5) a resolution\n\n       passed by the City of Edgerton, Kansas, to issue $500 million in industrial revenue bonds to fund\n\n       the second development phase of a logistics park similar to the NorthPoint Development, (6) a\n\n       public health study predicting 1900 premature deaths and $17 billion in social costs nationwide\n\n       due to emissions attributable to traffic congestion, and (7) the public hearing notice for the City\u2019s\n\n       November 2021 plan commission hearing.\n\n\u00b6 19                                          2. Motion to Dismiss\n\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f\u00b6 20          In March 2022, defendants filed a combined motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619.1\n\n       of the Code (735 ILCS 5\/2-619.1 (West 2022)). Under section 2-615, they argued that all five\n\n       counts failed to allege sufficient facts to support any cause of action. Under section 2-619,\n\n       defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 standing under counts I (private nuisance) and III (annexation\n\n       agreement validity). As to count I, defendants argued that, except for a few plaintiffs who allegedly\n\n       own property contiguous to the proposed development, none of the plaintiffs have standing to\n\n       bring a claim for private nuisance. As to count III, defendants argued plaintiffs had no standing to\n\n       challenge the annexation agreement\u2019s enforceability and, moreover, contract enforceability does\n\n       not provide a basis for a taxpayer suit.\n\n\u00b6 21          In response, plaintiffs argued defendants\u2019 section 2-615 argument attempted to hold\n\n       plaintiffs to an \u201cimpossible pleading standard.\u201d Plaintiffs maintained they had standing to raise\n\n       their claims and emphasized defendants were \u201ctrying to push through this gargantuan trucking and\n\n       warehouse development without even a traffic or environmental study.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 22                              3. Environmental Consultation Requirement\n\n\u00b6 23          After briefing and oral argument, the court took the matter under advisement and directed\n\n       the parties to submit any law with respect to the necessity of an environmental impact study. Upon\n\n       receiving the parties\u2019 submissions, the court found that \u201cissues should be considered with regards\n\n       to the provisions of the Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30\/17) and *** McHenry\n\n       County Defenders v. City of Harvard, 384 Ill. App. 3d 265 (2008).\u201d In July 2022, the court allowed\n\n       plaintiffs to file a fourth amended complaint restating the third amended complaint \u201cin full as it\n\n       exists now\u201d and adding any counts to address issues concerning the Illinois Natural Areas\n\n       Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30\/1 et seq. (West 2022)). The court further stated that the parties\u2019\n\n       arguments concerning defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cshall stand as a fully briefed and argued\n\n\n                                                        7\n\f       Motion to Dismiss those counts that are restated in the Fourth Amended Complaint, with ruling as\n\n       to those counts to remain pending.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24           Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint maintaining the existing five counts\n\n       and adding a sixth count, which sought a writ of mandamus directing the City to engage in\n\n       environmental consultations with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. On defendants\u2019\n\n       motion, the court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s mandamus claim (count VI) for mootness, finding the City\n\n       had completed the environmental consultation process demanded by plaintiffs. Count VI is not at\n\n       issue in this appeal.\n\n\u00b6 25                                       D. Circuit Court Decision\n\n\u00b6 26           In September 2022, the circuit court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I through\n\n       V of the fourth amended complaint, which had \u201crestated verbatim the 5 Counts of the Third\n\n       Amended Complaint and added Count VI seeking Mandamus.\u201d The court entered a written ruling\n\n       in which it found count I (private nuisance) improperly \u201clumps Plaintiffs that have distinct rights\n\n       and interests into a single group.\u201d Observing the nonuniform impact of noise and exhaust\n\n       emissions on plaintiffs and that \u201csafety will vary greatly based on proximity,\u201d the court dismissed\n\n       count I \u201cwithout prejudice as to any future individual nuisance claim any Plaintiff may acquire\n\n       when a parcel in the annexed area threatens or creates a specific identifiable and measurable\n\n       nuisance use on the parcel.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 27           The court found the nuisance allegations failed to state a cause of action for prospective\n\n       nuisance, whether private or public. In particular, the court found that while plaintiffs alleged the\n\n       proposed development would substantially increase truck traffic, \u201ca proposed or contemplated\n\n       time for completing build-out is not alleged and frankly is not known.\u201d It further stated, \u201cThe\n\n       complaint is describing conditions at an undetermined point in the future which by the nature of\n\n\n                                                        8\n\f       the development remains several years away.\u201d The court found, accordingly, that \u201c[t]he threat of\n\n       future high volume truck traffic is not supported by any factual allegations showing that the threat\n\n       is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u00b6 28          Further, in dismissing count II (public nuisance), the court opined that, due to the operation\n\n       of a nearby intermodal facility, truck traffic was likely to increase even if the proposed\n\n       development was enjoined. The court emphasized the need for benchmark data to allow for an\n\n       assessment of unreasonableness. It stated,\n\n              \u201cExisting high volumes of local truck traffic already pose environmental and safety\n\n              concerns which the Fourth Amended Complaint does not factually or statistically allege\n\n              and is needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable levels by\n\n              comparison. If an unreasonable level can be determined and factually alleged, it is possible\n\n              that current volumes of truck traffic exceed it and would then be subject to injunctive\n\n              relief.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29          In dismissing count III, which challenged the annexation agreement\u2019s validity, the court\n\n       found plaintiffs had not shown a failure to agree on an essential term. It further found plaintiffs\n\n       had not alleged a legal basis, in the annexation agreement or otherwise, for their claim that a traffic\n\n       study was a condition precedent to the agreement\u2019s execution. The court observed that count III\n\n       was \u201cpremature in assuming that *** the parties to the Annexation Agreement will disagree on\n\n       topics not specifically defined in the agreement.\u201d The court did not address defendants\u2019 standing\n\n       argument directly; however, it observed that \u201c[n]o disagreement or dispute between the parties to\n\n       the [annexation agreement] is before the Court.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30          In dismissing count IV, which alleged a deficient hearing notice, the court determined that\n\n       the Open Meetings Act did not \u201crequire that the notice be as detailed and error-free as argued [by]\n\n\n                                                         9\n\f       plaintiffs.\u201d The court also noted that plaintiffs did not allege the legal descriptions or PINs\n\n       prevented anyone from understanding the size, location, or boundaries of the area covered by the\n\n       proposed annexation.\n\n\u00b6 31           Finally, in dismissing count V, which alleged Open Meetings Act violations, the court\n\n       noted the Governor\u2019s face-mask mandate was directed at individuals, not municipalities. It further\n\n       noted that no legal basis exists, in statute or common law, to invalidate an ordinance or annexation\n\n       agreement passed at a public hearing where face masks were not worn.\n\n\u00b6 32           Stop NorthPoint, LLC, the Allen J. Lynch Medal of Honor Veterans Foundation, and 33\n\n       individual plaintiffs appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling. 2\n\n\u00b6 33                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 34           On appeal, plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred in dismissing counts I through V of\n\n       their fourth amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action under section 2-615 of the\n\n       Code (735 ILCS 5\/2-615 (West 2022)). A section 2-615 motion to dismiss challenges a\n\n       complaint\u2019s legal sufficiency based on facial defects. Marshall v. Burger King Corp., 222 Ill. 2d\n\n       422, 429 (2006). Because Illinois is a fact-pleading jurisdiction, a complaint must contain\n\n       sufficient factual allegations to bring its claims within legally recognized causes of action. Id. at\n\n       429-30. The circuit court considers, in ruling on a section 2-615 motion, whether the complaint\u2019s\n\n       factual allegations, when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, are sufficient to state a\n\n       claim on which relief can be granted. Id. at 429. A section 2-615 motion to dismiss admits all well-\n\n       pled facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. Id. A complaint should not be dismissed\n\n       under section 2-615 unless it is clear no set of facts can be proven that will entitle the plaintiff to\n\n\n\n               2\n                The remaining 21 plaintiffs did not participate in this appeal and are not further referred to herein\n       as plaintiffs.\n                                                            10\n\f       relief. Id. We review an order granting a section 2-615 motion de novo, drawing all reasonable\n\n       inferences in favor of the nonmovant. Id. Moreover, we review the circuit court\u2019s judgment, not\n\n       its rationale, and may affirm the judgment on any basis supported by the record. Smith v. The\n\n       Purple Frog, Inc., 2019 IL App (3d) 180132, \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 35                                             A. Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 36          Because plaintiffs bring claims for both private and public nuisance, we begin by\n\n       distinguishing between the two types of nuisances.\n\n\u00b6 37                                         1. Private Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 38          \u201cA private nuisance is the substantial invasion of a person\u2019s interest in the use and\n\n       enjoyment of his property.\u201d Whipple v. Village of North Utica, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 45.\n\n       The invasion must be unreasonable and either intentional or negligent. Id. \u201cWhether particular\n\n       conduct constitutes a \u2018nuisance\u2019 is determined by the conduct\u2019s effect on a reasonable person.\u201d Id.\n\n       \u201cA nuisance must be physically offensive to the senses to the extent that it makes life\n\n       uncomfortable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 39                                          2. Public Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 40          Unlike a private nuisance, which is an unreasonable interference with a property interest,\n\n       a public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the public. City of\n\n       Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 213 Ill. 2d 351, 366 (2004). \u201cSuch rights include the rights of\n\n       public health, public safety, public peace, public comfort, and public convenience.\u201d Id. at 370-71.\n\n       Nuisance may affect both a public and private right simultaneously; therefore, claims for private\n\n       and public nuisance are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\u00b6 41                              B. Count I\u2014Prospective Private Nuisance\n\n\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f\u00b6 42          Because plaintiffs seek to enjoin a proposed development still in the planning phase, they\n\n       necessarily proceed on a prospective nuisance theory. \u201c[A] prospective nuisance is a fit candidate\n\n       for injunctive relief.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 86 Ill. 2d\n\n       1, 25 (1981). \u201c[A] court of equity may enjoin a threatened or anticipated nuisance, where it clearly\n\n       appears that a nuisance will necessarily result from the contemplated act or thing which it is sought\n\n       to enjoin.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 26. Stated differently, an anticipated nuisance\n\n       may be enjoined preemptively if its threatened or potential harm is highly probable. See id. at 26-\n\n       27.\n\n\u00b6 43          Plaintiffs argue they have sufficiently pled a prospective private nuisance claim. We agree,\n\n       in part. Plaintiffs have alleged the proposed development will result in a significant increase in\n\n       semi-truck traffic, which will lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and generate constant noise,\n\n       vibration, and light pollution, rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable. They have\n\n       also alleged the increased truck traffic will substantially increase environmental pollutants, in the\n\n       form of smoke, fumes, and soot. They attached to their complaint a public health study indicating\n\n       that constant exposure to even low levels of air pollution increases the mortality risk for older\n\n       individuals. Because neighboring residents will be disproportionately subjected to the alleged\n\n       pollutants, count I raises a sufficient claim for private nuisance. Our analysis, however, does not\n\n       stop there.\n\n\u00b6 44                                           1. Property Interest\n\n\u00b6 45          Defendants argue that almost no plaintiffs possess a property interest at risk of invasion by\n\n       the proposed development. Defendants presented this argument in the circuit court as (1) a\n\n       sufficiency challenge under section 2-615 and (2) a standing challenge under section 2-619(a)(9).\n\n       Under both sections, defendants argued, in essence, that the lack of an actionable property interest\n\n\n                                                        12\n\f       was evident on the face of the complaint. Section 2-619 provides that a motion to dismiss must be\n\n       supported by affidavit if the alleged defects do not appear on the face of the pleadings. 735 ILCS\n\n       5\/2-619 (West 2022). By negative inference, if the grounds do appear on the face of the pleadings,\n\n       the motion need not be supported by affidavit. In fact, even a section 2-615 motion can be a proper\n\n       vehicle for an affirmative defense if that defense is apparent from the face of the complaint. R&B\n\n       Kapital Development, LLC v. North Shore Community Bank & Trust Co., 358 Ill. App. 3d 912,\n\n       921 (2005). Because defendants\u2019 argument does not tread beyond the complaint, it is \u201cpeculiarly\n\n       within the area of confluence between section 2-615 and section 2-619(a)(9).\u201d Illinois Graphics\n\n       Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill. 2d 469, 486 (1994).\n\n\u00b6 46          On appeal, defendants renew only their sufficiency argument. They maintain that, while a\n\n       plaintiff\u2019s property interest \u201cis an aspect of standing that may be raised as an affirmative defense,\n\n       it is also an element of the cause of action for private nuisance.\u201d Although we may consider any\n\n       argument in defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss that supports the circuit court\u2019s ruling, we give\n\n       precedence to the argument before us\u2014namely, that count I is insufficiently pled as to any plaintiff\n\n       who failed to allege an actionable property interest.\n\n\u00b6 47          Private nuisance has been defined as the \u201csubstantial invasion of another\u2019s interest in the\n\n       use and enjoyment of his or her land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In re Chicago Flood Litigation, 176 Ill.\n\n       2d 179, 204 (1997). Although the land-interest requirement is inherent to this definition, we have\n\n       only had the opportunity to address this requirement in the context of a section 2-619 standing\n\n       challenge. In Whipple, for instance, we addressed as a threshold matter the claim that plaintiffs\n\n       lacked standing to challenge the passage of annexation ordinances and the grant of a special use\n\n       permit for mining operations. Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 17. Ultimately, we found the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\f       defendants failed to meet their burden of proving lack of standing where \u201ceach plaintiff allege[d]\n\n       a possessory interest in property adjacent to or nearby the proposed mine site.\u201d Id. \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 48          Having established that each Whipple plaintiff alleged a possessory property interest, we\n\n       did not revisit the issue when discussing the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 prospective nuisance\n\n       allegations. Indeed, there was no need to revisit the issue where the plaintiffs were each alleged to\n\n       \u201cown, reside on, and\/or operate farmland that is adjacent to or within \u00bd mile of\u201d the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. \u00b6 3. This case is distinguishable in that regard, as plaintiffs\u2019\n\n       property interests vary widely with respect to the proposed development. We now address the\n\n       property-interest requirement in the context of defendant\u2019s section 2-615 sufficiency challenge.\n\n       To survive a section 2-615 challenge, a prospective private nuisance claim must allege a property\n\n       interest under threat of invasion.\n\n\u00b6 49          Plaintiffs have pled count I in a manner suggesting all plaintiffs are similarly situated in\n\n       relation to the alleged nuisance. This grouping, however, is belied by the complaint itself, which\n\n       alleges that only some plaintiffs have a property interest in the immediate vicinity of the proposed\n\n       development. According to the complaint, some plaintiffs are individuals who simply have\n\n       occasion to visit the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. Others are veterans organizations in\n\n       neighboring counties. One plaintiff is an individual who does not reside or own property in Illinois.\n\n       This in stark contrast to Whipple, in which the complaint alleged that all of the plaintiffs, without\n\n       exception, had a possessory interest in land adjacent to or within one-half mile of the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. Here, the lumping together of individuals and organizations with\n\n       disparate property interests is unhelpful and obfuscates the ultimate private nuisance analysis. It is\n\n       not, however, fatal to the claims of plaintiffs with actionable property interests.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        14\n\f\u00b6 50           Under the fourth amended complaint, many individual plaintiffs reside or own property in\n\n       various localities throughout Will County. 3 Only a few plaintiffs, however, are specifically alleged\n\n       to possess property interests that would neighbor the NorthPoint Development or be directly\n\n       impacted by it in some way. Plaintiff Kathleen Kirby, a Jackson Township resident, is alleged to\n\n       own property that \u201cwill be adjacent to the footprint of the development.\u201d Plaintiff Joseph Kinsella\n\n       is alleged to own a family farm and business in Wilton Township adjacent to Route 52, \u201cwhich\n\n       will certainly be impacted by the overflow truck traffic caused by the proposed industrial park.\u201d\n\n       Four plaintiffs are alleged to own property contiguous or adjacent to the proposed development:\n\n       Coley O\u2019Connell, Sarah O\u2019Connell, Robert Hauert, and Angel Hauert. Viewing the complaint in\n\n       the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we find count I sufficiently pled as to these six plaintiffs.\n\n\u00b6 51           We acknowledge the circuit court found count I deficiently pled due to the lack of\n\n       (1) allegations substantiating the immediacy of the threat of harm and (2) allegations detailing a\n\n       \u201cspecific identifiable and measurable nuisance use.\u201d Because these objections mirror defendants\u2019\n\n       arguments on appeal, we address both.\n\n\u00b6 52                                          2. Immediacy of Threat\n\n\u00b6 53           First, the circuit court emphasized that, for an injunction to issue, a threat of harm must be\n\n       \u201creal and immediate.\u201d Accordingly, it held plaintiffs to a pleading standard requiring \u201cfactual\n\n       allegations showing that the threat is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court derived its\n\n       immediacy requirement from the following language quoted by this court in Whipple:\n\n               \u201c \u2018While, as a general proposition, an injunction will be granted only to restrain an actual,\n\n               existing nuisance, a court of equity may enjoin a threatened or anticipated nuisance, where\n\n\n               In 2020, Will County had a land area of 835.88 square miles. U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts:\n               3\n\n       Will County, Illinois, U.S. Census Bureau, https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/willcountyillinois\/\n       LND110220 (last visited Jan. 16, 2024) [https:\/\/perma.cc\/WG6T-5UT5].\n                                                           15\n\f              it clearly appears that a nuisance will necessarily result from the contemplated act or thing\n\n              which it is sought to enjoin. This is particularly true where the proof shows that the\n\n              apprehension of material injury is well grounded upon a state of facts from which it appears\n\n              that the danger is real and immediate. While care should be used in granting injunctions to\n\n              avoid prospective injuries, there is no requirement that the court must wait until the injury\n\n              occurs before granting relief.\u2019 \u201d Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 46 (quoting Fink v.\n\n              Board of Trustees of Southern Illinois University, 71 Ill. App. 2d 276, 281-82 (1966)).\n\n       Fink sets forth the following guiding principle: a prospective nuisance may be enjoined where it\n\n       clearly appears a nuisance will necessarily result. Id. It then observes, \u201c \u2018This is particularly true\n\n       where the proof shows that the apprehension of material injury is well grounded upon a state of\n\n       facts from which it appears that the danger is real and immediate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. (quoting\n\n       Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 281-82). The circuit court underscored Fink\u2019s \u201creal and immediate\u201d\n\n       language but overlooked its context. Even so, plaintiffs\u2019 prospective nuisance allegations are well\n\n       grounded upon a highly probable state of facts derived from defendants\u2019 annexation agreement.\n\n       See Kaiser v. Fleming, 315 Ill. App. 3d 921, 925 (2000) (exhibits attached to complaint become\n\n       part of complaint for purpose of motion to dismiss). When viewed alongside plaintiffs\u2019 allegations,\n\n       the agreement substantiates the threat of a real and immediate danger.\n\n\u00b6 54          Indeed, immediacy is sufficiently alleged where an intergovernmental contract has been\n\n       executed, binding defendants for 20 years and providing for the development of a warehousing\n\n       and truck terminal park. The contract carries with it significant obligations on the contracting\n\n       parties and must be presumed enforceable through completion. If the agreement\u2019s objectives are\n\n       realized, there is little doubt the outcome will be an increase in truck traffic and, necessarily, all\n\n       consequences of that increase. \u201cWhile care should be used in granting injunctions to avoid\n\n\n                                                        16\n\f       prospective injuries, there is no requirement that the court must wait until the injury occurs before\n\n       granting relief.\u201d Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 282. Although the NorthPoint Development will take years\n\n       to complete, there is no reason plaintiffs should wait until full build-out to seek an injunction.\n\n\u00b6 55           The circuit court misconstrued Fink\u2019s immediacy language as requiring specific facts at\n\n       the pleading stage indicating a real and immediate danger. Such a requirement is an overextension\n\n       of the court\u2019s statement, made in the context of proof, not pleading, and prefaced by the phrase\n\n       \u201cthis is particularly true,\u201d serving to highlight a circumstance where the guiding principle (see\n\n       supra \u00b6 53) is particularly, though not exclusively, applicable. Our supreme court has, in fact,\n\n       recognized that establishing a serious and imminent threat of harm is only one way to prompt the\n\n       issuance of a permanent injunction. See Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 30 (\u201c \u2018Ordinarily a permanent\n\n       injunction will not lie unless (1) either the polluter seriously and imminently threatens the public\n\n       health or (2) he causes non-health injuries that are substantial and the business cannot be operated\n\n       to avoid the injuries apprehended.\u2019 \u201d (Emphases added.) (quoting Harrison v. Indiana Auto\n\n       Shredders Co., 528 F.2d 1107, 1123 (7th Cir. 1975))). Thus, while evidence of a real and\n\n       immediate danger makes a prospective nuisance an especially apt candidate for injunctive relief,\n\n       it is not essential at the pleading stage.\n\n\u00b6 56           Further, the immediacy language reflects the unique facts in Fink, in which a real and\n\n       immediate danger was shown where the defendant testified it intended to regularly spill large\n\n       quantities of sewage effluent, after chlorination treatment, into an intermittent watercourse flowing\n\n       past the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 279. The intermittent watercourse was already\n\n       present at the time of the injunction hearing, and it was just a matter of spilling the effluent in the\n\n       watercourse for the harm to be done. Id. at 279-280. The nature of the alleged nuisance in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                         17\n\f       present case is different, and perhaps more intrusive, than in Fink. 4 Count I sufficiently alleges\n\n       both the vexing effects of vibrations, noise, and air pollution and the pernicious effects of increases\n\n       in truck-generated smoke, fumes, and soot on plaintiffs with actionable property interests.\n\n\u00b6 57                                      3. Specific Nuisance Allegations\n\n\u00b6 58           The circuit court offered individual plaintiffs a chance to bring private nuisance actions in\n\n       the future, on the condition they could allege a \u201cspecific, identifiable and measurable nuisance\n\n       use\u201d\u2014whether threatened or actual\u2014on \u201ca parcel in the annexed area.\u201d Presumably, the court did\n\n       not believe truck-traffic congestion could yield an actionable nuisance. It stated that while it agrees\n\n       with the allegation that truck traffic is \u201cannoying\u201d due to noise, exhaust emissions, and safety\n\n       concerns, and that it will likely increase over the coming years, plaintiffs failed to allege \u201cspecific\n\n       facts showing a real threat of immediate harm, physical injury or violation of property interest.\u201d\n\n       (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u00b6 59           Once again, the court underscored immediacy. Such a requirement is satisfied by virtue of\n\n       defendants\u2019 fully executed annexation agreement. It makes little sense to foreclose a prospective\n\n       nuisance action simply because the enabling contract will be actualized in phases or over a period\n\n       of years. See Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 52 (executed annexation agreement establishes\n\n       basis for not viewing allegations of prospective harm as merely uncertain or speculative).\n\n       Moreover, while we agree that allegations of \u201cspecific, identifiable, measurable nuisance use\u201d\n\n       would be advantageous to plaintiffs\u2019 cause, the complaint furnishes sufficient allegations for a\n\n       court, viewing the complaint in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, to find it sufficiently states a\n\n       claim for private nuisance. Truck traffic that constantly annoys neighboring property owners due\n\n\n\n               4\n                In Fink, the court affirmed the grant of injunctive relief despite recognizing the harm was largely\n       subjective. Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 280.\n                                                           18\n\f       to noise, exhaust emissions, and safety concerns fits squarely within a private nuisance\u2019s general\n\n       definition: a substantial invasion of a person\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of his property.\n\n       Id. \u00b6 45. The court should not attempt, at the pleading stage, to weigh the threatened harm on a\n\n       \u201creasonableness scale.\u201d In resolving a section 2-615 motion to dismiss, the court may not assess\n\n       whether truck-traffic congestion will necessarily result in a substantial and unreasonable\n\n       interference with the neighboring residents\u2019 property interests. Accordingly, count I should have\n\n       been allowed to stand. We reverse the dismissal of count I as to the following plaintiffs: (1) Coley\n\n       O\u2019Connell, (2) Sarah O\u2019Connell, (3) Robert Hauert, (4) Angel Hauert, (5) Kathleen Kirby, and\n\n       (6) Joseph Kinsella.\n\n\u00b6 60                               C. Count II\u2014Prospective Public Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 61          Plaintiffs\u2019 briefs to this court make no reference to public nuisance as defined in the City\u2019s\n\n       municipal code. Accordingly, plaintiffs have forfeited any argument that the circuit court erred in\n\n       dismissing count II for failure to state a claim under the City\u2019s municipal code. See Ill. S. Ct. R.\n\n       341(h)(7) (eff. Oct. 1, 2020) (\u201cPoints not argued are forfeited ***.\u201d). We now consider whether\n\n       plaintiffs sufficiently pled a claim for public nuisance under the common law.\n\n\u00b6 62          \u201cWhen the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability is public nuisance, the pleading requirements are\n\n       not exacting because the \u2018concept of common law public nuisance *** elude[s] precise\n\n       definition.\u2019 \u201d Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 213 Ill. 2d at 364 (quoting City of Chicago v. Festival Theatre\n\n       Corp., 91 Ill. 2d 295, 306 (1982)). \u201cA sufficient pleading in a public nuisance cause of action will\n\n       allege a right common to the general public, the transgression of that right by the defendant, and\n\n       resulting injury.\u201d Id. at 369. Rights common to the general public include \u201cthe rights of public\n\n       health, public safety, public peace, public comfort, and public convenience.\u201d Id. at 370-71.\n\n       Because the alleged injury is prospective, plaintiffs must sufficiently plead that it \u201cwill necessarily\n\n\n                                                         19\n\f       result from the contemplated act or thing which it is sought to enjoin.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\n\n       omitted.) Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 26.\n\n\u00b6 63           Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for common-law public nuisance. With respect\n\n       to public health, plaintiffs alleged that a substantial increase in truck traffic will generate\n\n       significant amounts of noxious exhaust and diesel fumes especially harmful to the older members\n\n       of the community. With respect to public peace and comfort, plaintiffs alleged truck-traffic noise,\n\n       vibration, and pollution will interfere with the dignity, serenity, and quiet of visitors at a nearby\n\n       national cemetery. With respect to public convenience, plaintiffs alleged truck-traffic congestion\n\n       will increase motorists\u2019 travel times in the community. With respect to public safety, plaintiffs\n\n       alleged constant truck traffic will lead to a rise in semi-truck crash incidents.\n\n\u00b6 64           Defendants argue plaintiffs failed to allege that the NorthPoint Development would violate\n\n       any noise or air pollution regulations. While this could be a factor for the circuit court to consider\n\n       at an injunction hearing, it is not a pleading requirement. Defendants also argue that an\n\n       Environmental Defense Fund article referenced in plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief to this court, which\n\n       discusses the burden of truck-generated air pollution exposure, \u201crecognizes that there is a market-\n\n       driven need for warehouses, which bring jobs and economic growth opportunities; that there are\n\n       affordable ways to mitigate pollution, including zero-emissions trucks[;] and that recent moves of\n\n       the government are turbocharging investments in clean non-diesel trucks.\u201d This information, while\n\n       perhaps relevant in an injunction proceeding, does not negate the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 well-pled\n\n       allegations.\n\n\u00b6 65          The circuit court, in dismissing count II, stated that injunctive relief would be \u201cof dubious\n\n       value since truck traffic in the Joliet area *** is likely to increase even if this development were\n\n       enjoined since warehouse and industrial uses continue to grow ***, simply due to the existence of\n\n\n                                                         20\n\f       the intermodal facility now operating at its Will County location.\u201d The court further stated that the\n\n       complaint\u2019s public nuisance allegations were insufficient for failing to allege the \u201cenvironmental\n\n       and safety concerns\u201d of existing levels of local truck traffic. The court opined that such \u201cfactual[ ]\n\n       and statistical[ ]\u201d information \u201cis needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable\n\n       levels by comparison.\u201d 5 We do not agree with the need for specific benchmark statistics at the\n\n       pleading stage. An injunction hearing is required if the court wishes to compare current and\n\n       prospective data to determine whether the proposed development is reasonable. Moreover, the\n\n       court\u2019s prognosis of the requested injunction\u2019s efficacy is improper at this stage\u2014as is its\n\n       consideration of the existing intermodal facility in Will County. \u201c[C]ourts may not rely on matters\n\n       outside the complaint in considering a section 2-615 motion.\u201d Lake Point Tower Condominium\n\n       Ass\u2019n v. Waller, 2017 IL App (1st) 162072, \u00b6 10.\n\n\u00b6 66           We emphasize that section 2-615 warrants dismissal only if it is clear from the pleadings\n\n       that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts entitling them to relief. Id. Construing the complaint in the\n\n       light most favorable to plaintiffs, and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, it is not clear\n\n       that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts entitling them to relief. As pled, count II sufficiently alleges\n\n       rights common to the general public, the likely transgression of those rights by defendants, and\n\n       resulting injuries. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of count II insofar as it adequately states\n\n       a claim for common-law public nuisance.\n\n\u00b6 67                           D. Count III\u2014Validity of Annexation Agreement\n\n\u00b6 68           Plaintiffs argue they have sufficiently pled count III, in which they seek to void defendants\u2019\n\n       annexation agreement for vagueness. Count III rests on the theory that the annexation agreement\n\n\n\n\n               The circuit court also highlighted what it believed was the lack of an immediate threat, which we\n               5\n\n       have already addressed. Supra \u00b6\u00b6 53-59.\n                                                          21\n\f       is so indefinite and vague that a contract was never formed. It alleges, primarily, that numerous\n\n       essential terms are expressly contingent on a traffic study, the absence of which renders the\n\n       material terms of the agreement vague and the parties\u2019 contractual obligations undeterminable.\n\n\u00b6 69           Defendants argue, as they did in the section 2-619 portion of their combined motion to\n\n       dismiss, that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the annexation agreement\u2019s enforceability. A\n\n       section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss is proper where \u201cthe claim asserted against defendant is\n\n       barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.\u201d 735 ILCS\n\n       5\/2-619(a)(9) (West 2022). \u201cLack of standing is an \u2018affirmative matter\u2019 properly challenged in a\n\n       section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss.\u201d McCready v. Secretary of State, 382 Ill. App. 3d 789, 794-\n\n       95 (2008). Much like section 2-615, section 2-619 requires the circuit court to take all well-pled\n\n       facts in the complaint as true. Id. at 795. The court\u2019s dismissal under either section is subject to\n\n       de novo review. Id.\n\n\u00b6 70           \u201c[O]nly a party to the contract, one in privity with a party to the contract, or a third-party\n\n       beneficiary of the contract has standing to sue on a contract.\u201d Haake v. Board of Education for\n\n       Glenbard Township High School District 87, 399 Ill. App. 3d 121, 128-29 (2010). Nonparties to a\n\n       contract, including a municipal contract, who wish to sue based on the contract must plead their\n\n       status as third-party intended beneficiaries. See Salvi v. Village of Lake Zurich, 2016 IL App (2d)\n\n       150249, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55. Plaintiffs have not alleged third-party beneficiary status. Instead, they argue\n\n       count III is properly brought as a taxpayer action by six individual plaintiffs who pay taxes to the\n\n       City.\n\n\u00b6 71           A taxpayer action is brought \u201cfor the purpose of seeking relief from illegal or unauthorized\n\n       acts of public bodies or public officials, which acts are injurious to their common interests as such\n\n       taxpayers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Scachitti v. UBS Financial Services, 215 Ill. 2d\n\n\n                                                        22\n\f       484, 493 (2005). While the thrust of the complaint is arguably to prevent \u201cacts injurious to\n\n       [plaintiffs\u2019] common interests,\u201d count III seeks to invalidate a contract based on vague and\n\n       indefinite provisions. Unsatisfactory contract drafting does not qualify as an illegal or unauthorized\n\n       act of a public body or public official. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal, although we\n\n       do so under section 2-619 of the Code. See 735 ILCS 5\/2-619 (West 2022); see also People v.\n\n       Gawlak, 2019 IL 123182, \u00b6 39 (reviewing court may affirm on any basis in the record).\n\n\u00b6 72                              E. Count IV\u2014Hearing Notice Deficiencies\n\n\u00b6 73          Count IV also seeks to invalidate the annexation agreement. Unlike count III, however,\n\n       count IV does not attack the contract\u2019s substance. Instead, it attacks the notice issued for the public\n\n       hearing at which the agreement was approved. Plaintiffs alleged the City issued an inaccurate and\n\n       confusing notice which failed to comport with due process under the Illinois Constitution.\n\n       Specifically, plaintiffs alleged the notice contained incomplete, missing, and mismatched PINs.\n\n       Plaintiffs did not, however, allege any prejudice resulting from the alleged defects. Failure to allege\n\n       prejudice from a defective notice is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 claim. See Rogers v. City of Jerseyville, 196\n\n       Ill.

See Exec. Order No. 2021-\n\n       22, 45 Ill. Reg. 11,639 (Sept. 3, 2021), https:\/\/coronavirus.illinois.gov\/content\/dam\/soi\/en\/web\/\n\n       illinois\/documents\/government\/executive-order-2021-22.pdf            [https:\/\/perma.cc\/6ZVT-ES2M].\n\n       Plaintiffs alleged the City did not require masks at either hearing despite holding both during the\n\n       outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in an indoor public place subject to the governor\u2019s\n\n       mask mandate. As a result, members of the public who wished to participate in the hearings were\n\n       forced to risk their health and the health of their families and friends. This, according to plaintiffs,\n\n       amounted to a violation of section 2.01 of the Open Meetings Act (Act), which requires meetings\n\n       be held at \u201cspecified times and places which are convenient and open to the public.\u201d (Emphasis\n\n       added.) 5 ILCS 120\/2.01 (West 2020). Plaintiffs argue that an open meeting held in an\n\n       inconvenient place violates the Act.\n\n\u00b6 76          \u201cA meeting can be open in the sense that no one is prohibited from attending it, but it can\n\n       be held in such an ill-suited, unaccommodating, unadvantageous place that members of the public,\n\n       as a practical matter, would be deterred from attending it.\u201d Gerwin v. Livingston County Board,\n\n       345 Ill. App. 3d 352, 361 (2003).\u201cSection 2.01 requires a place that is \u2018convenient\u2019 not merely to\n\n       members of the public who show up for the meeting but to the \u2018public\u2019 as a whole.\u201d Id. at 362.\n\n       \u201cThe concept of public convenience seems to imply a rule of reasonableness, not absolute\n\n       accessibility but reasonable accessibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 77          In essence, count V alleges the City\u2019s decision not to mandate masks amounted to a\n\n       violation of the Act\u2019s convenient-meetings requirement. Although the City\u2019s failure to mandate\n\n       masks is arguably contrary to the spirit of the Act, as it could deter public participation, it is not\n\n       contrary to the Act\u2019s plain language. \u201cThe best indicator of legislative intent is the statutory\n\n       language itself, given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d Cothron v. White Castle Systems, Inc., 2023\n\n\n                                                         24\n\f       IL 128004, \u00b6 20. \u201cWhere the language is clear and unambiguous, we must apply the statute without\n\n       resort to further aids of statutory construction.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 78          Section 2.01 requires municipalities to hold public hearings at convenient places and times.\n\n       5 ILCS 120\/2.01 (West 2020). The section does not require municipalities to adjust their hearing\n\n       protocols based on public health advisories or external health directives. Moreover, by plaintiffs\u2019\n\n       own admission, the health directives in this case targeted individuals, not municipal governments.\n\n       See supra \u00b6 75. Thus, given that (1) the executive order did not task municipal governments with\n\n       mask-mandate enforcement and (2) the legislature placed a convenience requirement exclusively\n\n       on meeting places and times, the complaint cannot state a claim under section 2.01 of the Act. In\n\n       so ruling, we recognize the hearings\u2019 mask-optional rule might have deterred public participation;\n\n       however, the judiciary may not act as a policymaker in construing the Act\u2019s provisions. See\n\n       Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Rosen, 242 Ill. 2d 48, 56 (2011) (\u201c[W]hen the legislature has declared,\n\n       by law, the public policy of the State, the judicial department must remain silent, and if a\n\n       modification or change in such policy is desired the law-making department must be applied to,\n\n       and not the judiciary, whose function is to declare the law but not to make it.\u201d (Internal quotation\n\n       marks omitted.)).\n\n\u00b6 79          Count V does not allege the City failed to provide a convenient time for its hearings. Nor\n\n       does it allege the City held the hearings in an \u201cill-suited, unaccommodating, [or] unadvantageous\u201d\n\n       place. Gerwin, 345 Ill. App. 3d at 361. Accordingly, when construed in the light most favorable to\n\n       plaintiffs, count V failed to state a cause of action under the Act.

No. CGC22597932)\n           Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         This appeal arises from successive lawsuits relating to administration\nof the San Francisco Teacher Residency Program (Residency program).\nLoran Simon, a former employee of the Residency program, filed two prior\nlawsuits based on allegations that appellant University of San Francisco\n(USF) and respondent Community Initiatives fraudulently obtained federal\nfunding to administer the Residency program. In the present action, USF\nseeks indemnity from Community Initiatives for damages it incurred in\nconnection with the Simon litigation. This appeal is from an order\ndisqualifying Michael Vartain and Vartain Law Group (Vartain) from\nrepresenting USF in the pending indemnity action due to Vartain\u2019s prior\nrepresentation of Community Initiatives in the Simon lawsuits. We affirm\nthat order.\n\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                              BACKGROUND\nThe Prior Lawsuits\n      Simon\u2019s Complaints\n      In November 2016, Simon filed a federal action against USF and\nCommunity Initiatives under qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. At\nthe time, Simon was Assistant Director of the Residency program, which he\ndescribed as a training program for teachers to improve achievement of\nhistorically underserved students that was operated by five organizations:\nUSF; Community Initiatives; the San Francisco Unified School District (SF\nUnified); the Stanford University Teacher Education Program (Stanford); and\nUnited Educators of San Francisco. According to his complaint, Simon was\ninitially employed by USF in June 2014, and in September 2016 his\nemployment was transferred to Community Initiatives, a fiscal sponsor that\nassisted with administration of the Residency program.\n      Simon alleged that during his tenure as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program, USF and Community Initiatives submitted fraudulent\nclaims to obtain grant money from federal programs, including AmeriCorps\n(previously known as the Corporation for National and Community Services).\nAccording to the complaint, all teacher candidates who participated in the\nResidency program obtained an AmeriCorps stipend, as well as other\nfinancial benefits from their respective universities. Simon alleged that the\ndefendants failed to \u201ctrack\u201d the time and effort of these AmeriCorps\nparticipants and instead used falsified timesheets to obtain federal funding.\n      In June 2019, while his federal case was pending, Simon filed a state\ncourt action seeking damages for wrongful termination, naming multiple\ndefendants including USF, Community Initiatives, and Peter Williamson, a\nStanford faculty member who served as Chairman of the Residency\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\fprogram\u2019s Advisory Board. Simon alleged that on June 30, 2017, he was\nwrongfully terminated from his employment as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program in retaliation for engaging in protected activity, including\ncontesting racial discrimination, and reporting violations of the state and\nfederal False Claims Acts. Simon alleged that the defendants were all liable\nfor his wrongful termination as they were his joint employers and acted\ntogether to terminate him.\n      Arbitration Petitions In Simon\u2019s Wrongful Termination Case\n      On October 2, 2019, USF petitioned the superior court to compel\narbitration and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination action. Vartain drafted\nand filed the petition on behalf of USF. USF sought to compel arbitration\npursuant to a provision in its written employment agreement with Simon.\n      The following day, USF executed a Joint Defense and Confidentiality\nAgreement (JDA) with Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson. The\nstated purpose of the JDA was to \u201censure that exchanges and disclosures of\nconfidential, privileged, and otherwise protected information\u201d among the\nparties for purposes of pursuing a petition for an order to arbitrate were not\ninterpreted as a waiver of the confidential or privileged nature of the\ninformation that was disclosed. Michael Vartain signed the JDA on behalf of\nVartain as attorneys for USF, and Stanford\u2019s Vice President and General\nCounsel, Debra Zumwalt, signed the JDA as attorney for Williamson and\nCommunity Initiatives.\n      The terms of the JDA were set forth in 24 numbered paragraphs,\naddressing issues such as the type of material covered by the agreement, and\nongoing obligations of the parties and their counsel to protect the privileged\nnature of the shared material. Paragraph 11 addressed the subject of\ncontinued representation should a party to the JDA assert a claim against\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fanother party in the wrongful termination case or separate litigation. In that\nevent, the JDA states, \u201ceach attorney of any Party who has access to or\nreceives any Joint Defense Material shared under [the JDA] shall remain\nnonetheless qualified to continue to represent his or her client in the defense\nor pursuit of the claim(s).\u201d In paragraph 11, the parties also agreed to the\nfollowing: \u201cAny conflict of interest arising out of the sharing of Joint Defense\nMaterials under this Agreement is waived. Any right of any Party to move to\ndisqualify any attorney for any Party to this Agreement on the grounds that\nsuch attorney has received Joint Defense Materials shared under this\nAgreement is waived.\u201d\n      On October 4, 2019, Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson filed\na petition for an order to arbitrate and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination\ncomplaint (the non-signatories\u2019 petition). The non-signatories\u2019 petition and\nsupporting documents were signed by Vartain as attorneys for Community\nInitiatives and Williamson. Michael Vartain filed a supporting declaration,\nwhich stated that he was appearing on behalf of Community Initiatives and\nWilliamson for the limited purpose of filing and arguing their arbitration\npetition. In a supporting memorandum, Vartain argued that USF\u2019s\narbitration agreement encompassed Simon\u2019s entire complaint, that Simon\nwas estopped from refusing to arbitrate his claims against Community\nInitiatives and other entity defendants, and that the arbitration agreement\napplied to Williamson and other individual defendants pursuant to principles\nof agency.\n      On November 1, 2019, the superior court held a hearing on both\narbitration petitions. USF\u2019s petition was granted pursuant to an uncontested\ntentative ruling that Simon\u2019s broad arbitration agreement with USF applied\nto his employment law claims. Simon contested a tentative ruling to grant\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fthe non-signatories\u2019 petition, but after the matter was argued, the court\ngranted that petition as well.\n      Dismissals of Simon\u2019s Lawsuits\n      The Simon lawsuits were both resolved in May 2020. On May 18, the\nUnited States government intervened in the qui tam action \u201cfor settlement\npurposes against defendant [USF].\u201d During negotiations between the\ngovernment and USF, Vartain requested that a contemplated release of\nSimon\u2019s qui tam claims also include Community Initiatives, and the\ngovernment agreed to the request. On May 18, the United States and Simon\nfiled a joint proposed dismissal of the qui tam action with prejudice. The\norder was filed May 21, confirming Simon\u2019s dismissal extended to all\ndefendants. The United States dismissed Simon\u2019s claims with prejudice to\nthe extent they were \u201cbrought against USF under the False Claims Act,\narising from USF\u2019s status as the fiscal agent which applied AmeriCorps funds\nto support and administer the [Residency program] during the 2014, 2015,\nand 2016 grant years.\u201d The following week, on May 27, Simon dismissed his\nwrongful termination case, serving notice of the dismissal on Vartain as\nattorneys for USF, Community Initiatives, and Williamson.\nThe Current Indemnity Action\n      In February 2022, USF, represented by Vartain, filed the underlying\naction for contractual and equitable indemnity and declaratory relief, seeking\nto recover more than $4.5 million as damages it incurred to settle the qui tam\naction. USF alleges that its liability in the Simon cases was based solely on\nconduct by the Residency program\u2019s manager, who was the employee and\nagent of SF Unified. In its original complaint, USF named SF Unified as the\nsole defendant, but its operative first amended complaint names Community\nInitiatives and Stanford as additional defendants. USF\u2019s pleaded theory is\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fthat each defendant must indemnify USF in proportion to its relative fault\nrelating to the fraudulent procurement of AmeriCorps funds because they\nwere all USF\u2019s partners and comembers of the Residency program\u2019s Advisory\nBoard.\n      In November 2022, Stanford filed its answer to USF\u2019s complaint along\nwith a cross-complaint. Community Initiatives filed a demurrer, which was\nvigorously opposed and ultimately denied on December 22. On December 14,\nwhile the demurrer was still pending, Community Initiatives filed a motion\nto disqualify Vartain from representing USF in the present action.\nCommunity Initiatives argued that Vartain\u2019s previous attorney-client\nrelationship with Community Initiatives in the Simon cases created a conflict\nof interest that Community Initiatives did not waive. Stanford filed a joinder\nin Community\u2019s Initiatives disqualification motion and USF filed vigorous\nopposition.\nThe Disqualification Order\n      On January 18 and 20, 2023, the trial court held a hearing before\ntaking the disqualification motion under submission. On January 23, the\ncourt disqualified Vartain from representing USF in the pending action,\nmemorializing its findings in a six-page order.\n      The trial court\u2019s analysis of the disqualification motion was framed by a\npreliminary finding that Vartain represented Community Initiatives in\nSimon\u2019s wrongful termination case. The court emphasized that Vartain\nsigned and filed Community Initiatives\u2019 successful petition to compel\narbitration, supporting memorandum, and reply brief, and all these court\nfilings identified Vartain as \u201c \u2018Attorneys for Defendant Community\nInitiatives.\u2019 \u201d The court made an additional finding that Vartain assisted\nCommunity Initiatives with \u201c \u2018getting released\u2019 \u201d from the qui tam case, which\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\fwas also brought by Simon and named Community Initiatives and USF as\ncodefendants.\n      Turning to the merits of the motion, the court applied a \u201c \u2018substantial\nrelationship\u2019 \u201d test, which courts use to evaluate alleged attorney conflicts\nthat arise from successive representation of clients with adverse interests.\n(Citing, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc. (2006)\n38 Cal.4th 839, 847 (Cobra Solutions).) Concluding that Community\nInitiatives made the requisite showing of a substantial relationship between\nVartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and their current\nrepresentation of USF, the court made two sets of material findings.\n      First, Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\ninitiatives during the prior actions. This finding was based on Michael\nVartain\u2019s personal involvement in successfully litigating Community\nInitiatives\u2019 arbitration petition, and the fact that the petition was the most\nimportant motion in the wrongful termination case because after that\npetition was granted \u201c \u2018[t]he case was over.\u2019 \u201d Simon \u201c \u2018never submitted the\ndispute to arbitrat[ion]\u2019 and instead dismissed it with prejudice.\u201d (Quoting\nMichael Vartain\u2019s declaration.) In addition, the court observed that after\nVartain obtained a positive outcome for Community Initiatives in the\nemployment termination case, they offered further assistance by helping to\nsecure a release from liability for Community Initiatives in the federal qui\ntam action.\n      Second, the court found that the Simon cases and the pending\nindemnity action are linked by their subject matter, as they involve\noverlapping parties and issues. As the court explained, the wrongful\ntermination case and USF\u2019s current indemnity action concern the same\nallegations of \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against Community Initiatives\u2014that it played a\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\frole in submitting falsified timesheets for AmeriCorps funding\u2014which is the\nsame conduct that led USF to settle Simon\u2019s qui tam action. After previously\ndefending Community Initiatives from those allegations, Vartain was now\nattempting to prove wrongdoing by Community Initiatives, and, the court\nfound, \u201cinformation material to the former representation and assistance is\nalso material to the subsequent representation.\u201d\n      The court found that because a substantial relationship exists between\nthe former representation and the current case, \u201cit is \u2018conclusively presumed\nthat [the] attorney knows confidential information adverse to [his or her]\nformer client.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting National Grange of Order of Patrons of Husbandry\nv. California Guild (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 706, 717 (National Grange).)\nUnder these circumstances, the court concluded, the substantial relationship\nbetween Vartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and the\nsubject matter of the current action mandates disqualifying Michael Vartain\nand his firm from representing USF in the pending case.\n      In reaching this disposition, the court rejected contentions by USF that\nCommunity Initiatives waived its right to seek disqualification of Vartain.\nSpecifically, USF argued that Community Initiatives consented to Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent representation of USF by signing the JDA in Simon\u2019s wrongful\ntermination action. The court disagreed, finding that the JDA pertained to\nthe sharing of information among codefendants, not to a waiver of future\nconflicts of interest. USF also argued that Community Initiatives was\nattempting to gain an unfair tactical advantage by bringing its motion after\n21 months\u2019 delay and causing extreme prejudice to USF. The court found\nthat \u201cdelay and any prejudice\u201d in bringing the motion \u201cwere minimal,\u201d\npointing out that the case began when Vartain sued SF Unified; that\nCommunity Initiative was later added as a defendant in the amended\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fcomplaint, which was not served until July 2022; discovery did not begin\nuntil November; and the disqualification motion was filed the following\nmonth.\n                                  DISCUSSION\n      \u201cThe authority of a trial court \u2018to disqualify an attorney derives from\nthe power inherent in every court \u201c[t]o control in furtherance of justice, the\nconduct of its ministerial officers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at\np. 846.) Disqualification motions implicate conflicts between the client\u2019s right\nto counsel of choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of\nprofessional responsibility, but the \u201c \u2018paramount concern must be to preserve\npublic trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of\nthe bar.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) We review the trial court\u2019s decision on a disqualification\nmotion for abuse of discretion, applying the deferential substantial evidence\ntest to any disputed findings of fact. (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v.\nSpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1143.) \u201cHowever,\nthe trial court\u2019s discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles,\u201d and \u201ca\ndisqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the\ntrial court\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d (Id. at p. 1144.)\nI. Issues on Appeal\n      Attorney disqualification matters typically arise from one of two\ncommon factual scenarios: successive representations, where an attorney\nseeks to represent a client with interests that are potentially adverse to a\nformer client; and concurrent representations, where an attorney seeks to\nsimultaneously represent clients with potentially or actually adverse\ninterests. (Flatt v. Superior Court (1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 283; Antelope Valley\nGroundwater Cases (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 602, 617 (Antelope Valley).)\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fCourts have developed distinct disqualification standards to address each\nscenario. (Flatt, at p. 283.)\n      In this case, we review a disqualification order that precludes Vartain\u2019s\nsuccessive representation of clients with adverse interests. \u201cIt is well\nestablished that an attorney, after severing his or her relationship with a\nclient, \u2018may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in\nany matter in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use\nagainst his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the\nprevious relationship.\u2019 [Citations.] This prohibition is grounded in both the\nCalifornia State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, former rule 3-310(E) in\neffect until November 1, 2018, and rule 1.9, effective November 1, 2018, and\ngoverning case law.\u201d (O\u2019Gara Coach Co., LLC v. Ra (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th\n1115, 1124.)\n      The \u201cenduring duty to preserve client confidences precludes an attorney\nfrom later agreeing to represent an adversary of the attorney\u2019s former client\nunless the former client provides an \u2018informed written consent\u2019 waiving the\nconflict.\u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847, quoting Rules Prof.\nConduct, former rule 3-310(E); see current rule 1.9 (citations to rules refer to\nthe California State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct).)1 \u201cIf the attorney\nfails to obtain such consent and undertakes to represent the adversary, the\nformer client may disqualify the attorney by showing a \u2018 \u201csubstantial\nrelationship\u201d \u2019 between the subjects of the prior and current representations.\u201d\n\n\n\n      1  In moving for Vartain\u2019s disqualification from this case, Community\nInitiatives relied specifically on rule 1.9(a), which states: \u201cA lawyer who has\nformerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent\nanother person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that\nperson\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client\nunless the former client gives informed written consent.\u201d\n\n                                       10\n\f(Cobra Solutions, at p. 847; see also Victaulic Co. v. American Home\nAssurance Co. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 485, 506 (Victaulic).) \u201cWhen a\nsubstantial relationship between the two representations is established, the\nattorney is automatically disqualified from representing the second client.\u201d\n(Cobra Solutions, at p. 847.)\n      On appeal, USF implicitly concedes that Community Initiatives is\nVartain\u2019s former client. But it contends the trial court abused its discretion\nby disqualifying Vartain because (1) there is no substantial relationship\nbetween the previous representation and the present action, and (2)\nCommunity Initiatives waived Vartain\u2019s conflict of interest. We reject both\narguments.\nII. Substantial Relationship Analysis\n      In Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th 847, the California Supreme\nCourt affirmed that the substantial relationship test should be used to\nevaluate disqualification issues in successive representation cases and\nsummarized the key features of this inquiry. The court \u201cmust first determine\nwhether the attorney had a direct professional relationship with the former\nclient in which the attorney personally provided legal advice and services on\na legal issue that is closely related to the legal issue in the present\nrepresentation. [Citation.] If the former representation involved such a\ndirect relationship with the client, the former client need not prove that the\nattorney possesses actual confidential information. [Citation.] Instead, the\nattorney is presumed to possess confidential information if the subject of the\nprior representation put the attorney in a position in which confidences\nmaterial to the current representation would normally have been imparted to\ncounsel.\u201d (Id. at p. 847; see also rule 1.9, comment 3 [two matters are\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fsubstantially related for purposes of this rule if they involve a substantial\nrisk of a violation of a duty owed to the former client].)\n      \u201cWhen the attorney\u2019s contact with the prior client was not direct, then\nthe court examines both the attorney\u2019s relationship to the prior client and the\nrelationship between the prior and the present representation. If the\nsubjects of the prior representation are such as to \u2018make it likely the attorney\nacquired confidential information\u2019 that is relevant and material to the\npresent representation, then the two representations are substantially\nrelated.\u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847.)\n      We conclude that the trial court correctly applied the principles set\nforth in Cobra Solutions, and its findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.2\n      The finding of a direct professional relationship between Vartain and\nCommunity Initiatives is supported by Michael Vartain\u2019s personal\nappearance on behalf of Community Initiatives in the wrongful termination\ncase, and the substantive legal services Vartain rendered to successfully\nlitigate the non-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF contends Vartain\u2019s\nprior representation of Community Initiatives was indirect and insubstantial\nbecause it was a limited appearance based on work Vartain had already put\ninto preparing USF\u2019s arbitration petition. In fact, the record shows that the\ntwo arbitration petitions presented distinct legal issues; USF\u2019s petition was\ngranted pursuant to an arbitration agreement, while the non-signatories\u2019\npetition was granted pursuant to principles of agency and estoppel.\nMoreover, the minute order from the hearing on the petitions reflects that\n\n\n\n      2  Although the trial court expressly relied on Cobra Solutions in\nreaching its conclusions, the case is not even mentioned in the appellate\nbriefs that Vartain prepared and filed on behalf of USF.\n\n                                        12\n\fUSF\u2019s petition was unopposed, while Community Initiatives\u2019 petition was\ncontested. Beyond that, as Michael Vartain conceded below, the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition was dispositive, leading directly to dismissal\nof the wrongful termination action.\n      USF argues that Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration conclusively shows\nthere was no direct prior relationship with Community Initiatives because\nMr. Vartain\u2019s only contact with Community Initiatives occurred prior to the\narbitration hearing, when he was briefly introduced to Community Initiatives\nVice President, David McGee. We are unpersuaded by this argument, which\nis premised on an untenably narrow conception of the word \u201cdirect.\u201d McGee,\nwho also filed a declaration in the lower court, recalled exchanging an email\nwith Michael Vartain and also having an in-person discussion with him about\nVartain\u2019s representation of Community Initiatives when they met before the\nhearing. Moreover, Michael Vartain acknowledged that he worked directly\nwith attorneys from Stanford\u2019s General Counsel office to draft the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF fails to diminish Vartain\u2019s role by\npointing out that Stanford\u2019s General Counsel also represented Community\nInitiatives. Vartain\u2019s collaboration with other lawyers who also represented\ntheir client is additional evidence of Vartain\u2019s direct representation of\nCommunity Initiatives in the wrongful termination case.\n      Substantial evidence also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the\nlegal services Vartain provided during their prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives involved a legal issue that is substantially related to\nthe legal issue in the pending action. Indeed, a pivotal issue in the wrongful\ntermination case underlies this indemnity action\u2014whether Community\nInitiatives is liable for problems in the administration of the Residency\nprogram, including the submission of false claims for AmeriCorps funding,\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\fand the alleged retaliatory discharge of Simon for reporting this misconduct.\nAfter previously defending Community Initiatives against these allegations,\nVartain now seeks to change sides and pursue those same allegations of\nwrongdoing against Community Initiatives.\n      In its reply brief, USF posits that these two matters are not sufficiently\nrelated to satisfy the substantial relationship test. We disagree. In the\nwrongful termination action, Simon\u2019s claims against Community Initiatives\nwere premised on agency allegations, including that Community Initiatives\nbecame his joint employer in October 2016, and that Community Initiatives\nconspired with USF to wrongfully terminate him in 2017 in retaliation for\nengaging in protected activity.3 Simon\u2019s allegedly protected activity included\nreporting violations of the False Claims Act, which was the same conduct at\nissue in Simon\u2019s qui tam case, the settlement of which gave rise to USF\u2019s\npending indemnity claims against Community Initiatives.\n      USF takes the position that the substantive nature of the wrongful\ntermination case is irrelevant since Vartain\u2019s representation of Community\nInitiatives was limited to the petition to arbitrate. To begin with, the record\ndoes not show that Vartain and Community Initiatives agreed to a limited\nscope representation. USF acknowledged at oral argument before this court\nthat Vartain did not file a form CIV-150 Notice of Limited Scope\nRepresentation. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.36.) And the declaration\nMichael Vartain filed in the wrongful termination case stated that he was\nappearing in court on behalf of the non-signatories\u2019 for a limited purpose but\ndid not address the nature or scope of Vartain\u2019s agreement to represent\n\n\n      3 According to USF, Simon\u2019s \u201caccusation of whistleblower retaliation\nwas specifically aimed at USF and not [Community Initiatives].\u201d Not so.\nEvery cause of action alleged against USF in the wrongful termination case\nwas also alleged against Community Initiatives.\n\n                                       14\n\fCommunity Initiatives. In any event, USF overlooks that the grounds for the\nnon-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition were the very agency allegations upon\nwhich Simon sought to hold Community Initiatives jointly liable for wrongful\ntermination in his employment case and for violating the False Claims Act in\nthe federal qui tam case. This factor connects not only Simon\u2019s two cases, but\nthe pending action in which USF seeks indemnity from Community\nInitiatives. Only this time, Vartain is not defending Community Initiatives\nagainst allegations of joint misconduct but attempting to hold it liable for\nthat precise reason.\n      Taking a different tack, USF argues that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by finding a substantial relationship between the qui tam action\nand the current action despite the fact that Vartain did not represent\nCommunity Initiatives in the qui tam action. This argument misconstrues\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, which did not parse out the qui tam case as an\nindependent basis for disqualification. Instead, the court found evidentiary\nsupport for Community Initiative\u2019s argument in the fact that after Vartain\nappeared in court as Community Initiative\u2019s lawyer in the wrongful\ntermination case, they provided additional assistance to Community\nInitiatives by obtaining its release in the qui tam case. This evidence\nreinforces that the two Simon cases and the present indemnity action are\ninterrelated, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s taking account\nof this fact.\n      Attempting to shore up its sufficiency of the evidence challenge, USF\ncontends that Community Initiatives failed to carry its burden of proof\nbecause there is no evidence that Vartain actually obtained relevant\nconfidential information about Community Initiatives. However, no such\nshowing is required when, as here, a substantial relationship exists between\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe former and current representation. (See e.g., National Grange, supra, 38\nCal.App.5th at p. 717; Henriksen v. Great American Savings & Loan (1992)\n11 Cal.App.4th 109, 114.) \u201cIf the former client establishes the existence of a\nsubstantial relationship between the two representations the court will\nconclusively presume that the attorney possesses confidential information\nadverse to the former client and order disqualification.\u201d (Henriksen, at\np. 114.) Indeed, \u201cwhere the lawyer was personally involved in providing legal\nadvice and services to the former client\u2014then it must be presumed that\nconfidential information has passed to the attorney and there cannot be any\ndelving into the specifics of the communications between the attorney and the\nformer client in an effort to show that the attorney did or did not receive\nconfidential information during the course of that relationship.\u201d (Jessen v.\nHartford Casualty Ins. Co. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 698, 709 (Jessen).)\n      Insisting that Vartain\u2019s prior relationship with Community Initiatives\ndoes not give rise to a presumption that confidences were shared, USF\nmistakenly relies on Victaulic, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th 485. In that protracted\ninsurance coverage litigation, the defendants filed a motion to disqualify the\nplaintiff\u2019s law firm on the ground that two lawyers who recently joined the\nfirm had\u2014several years earlier\u2014done work for the claims-handling arm of\nthe defendants\u2019 parent company. (Id. at p. 491.) An order denying\ndisqualification was affirmed on appeal pursuant to a detailed evidentiary\nanalysis that we need not recount here. Suffice it to say, both the trial and\nappellate court agreed that the defendants failed to prove that the two\nattorneys in question had a direct personal relationship with them, or even\nthat a prior attorney-client relationship existed. (Id. at pp. 501\u2013502 & 510.)\nWithout that showing, there was no presumption the attorneys possessed\nconfidential information. (Id. at p. 502; see also Cobra Solutions, supra, 38\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fCal.4th at p. 847.) For this reason, the Victaulic court also considered\nwhether other circumstances showed that it was likely the attorneys acquired\nconfidential information that was relevant and material to the current\nmatter, and again agreed with the trial court that the defendants failed to\nmake that showing. (Victaulic, at pp. 511\u2013514; see pp. 502\u2013503.)\n      In contrast to Victaulic, in the present case we review an order\ngranting disqualification, and because the trial court\u2019s findings are supported\nby substantial evidence, USF\u2019s heavy reliance on Victaulic is misplaced.\nUnlike that case, here a closer consideration of the nature of the prior\nrelationship was unnecessary once Community Services carried its burden of\nshowing that Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\nServices and personally provided legal advice and services in a\nrepresentation that is substantially related to the present action. As the trial\ncourt found, these facts give rise to a presumption Vartain possesses\nconfidential information, without the need for further proof that material\nconfidential information was likely conveyed. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38\nCal.4th at p. 847; Jessen, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at p. 709.)\nIII. Waiver Analysis\n      \u201cNot all conflicts of interest require disqualification. In some\nsituations, the attorney may still represent the client if the client\u2019s consent is\nobtained. [Citations.] \u2018Giving effect to a client\u2019s consent to a conflicting\nrepresentation might rest either on the ground of contract freedom or on the\nrelated ground of personal autonomy of a client to choose whatever champion\nthe client feels is best suited to vindicate the client\u2019s legal entitlements.\u2019 \u201d\n(Zador Corp. v. Kwan (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1295.)\n      Under the circumstances presented here, involving successive\nrepresentation of clients with adverse interests, Vartain may not represent\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fUSF in this action that is substantially related to its prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives without obtaining informed written consent waiving\nthe conflict. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847; rule 1.9(a).) USF\nargues that Vartain did obtain the requisite consent from Community\nInitiatives, and the trial court abused its discretion by finding otherwise. We\ndisagree.\n      USF bases its claim of error on the JDA that was executed in the\nwrongful termination case. As discussed in our background summary, the\nJDA is an agreement to share defense materials without waiving privileges\napplicable to those materials. The only attorney conflict that was waived in\nthe JDA is the conflict arising from access to joint defense materials that\nwere shared pursuant to that agreement. As the trial court found, the JDA\ndoes not address the type of conflict that arose when Vartain filed USF\u2019s\nindemnity complaint against their former client. USF\u2019s contrary view is not\nsupported by the language of the JDA or the factual circumstances. Indeed,\nit appears that when the JDA was executed by the parties\u2019 counsel on\nOctober 3, 2019, Vartain did not have an attorney-client relationship with\nCommunity Initiatives. However, in the ensuing weeks and months, Vartain\nappeared in court on behalf of Community Initiatives and provided additional\nassistance in the related qui tam case. Now, more than two years later,\nVartain seeks to sue its former client on behalf of USF. The JDA does not\nexpressly or implicitly address Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest. On its\nface, the JDA is not informed written consent to Vartain\u2019s current\nrepresentation of an adversary of their former client.\n      USF argues that the JDA should be construed as a waiver of Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent conflict because it shows that the parties in the wrongful termination\ncase did not have any expectation of confidentiality with respect to material\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthey exchanged under the JDA. This logic is flawed; the fact that USF and\nCommunity Initiatives agreed to share discrete information in the prior\nlitigation does mean there was a blanket waiver of attorney-client\nconfidentiality. By signing the JDA, the parties agreed expressly to waive\none specific right: to bring a disqualification motion based on the fact that\nthey shared defense materials. Evidence of that narrowly drawn waiver cuts\nagainst USF\u2019s theory here that all of Vartain\u2019s conflicts of interest were\nwaived by signing the JDA.\n      USF\u2019s other arguments pertaining to the JDA lack factual and legal\nsupport. For example, USF assumes that the trial court failed to consider\nevidence that the JDA was drafted by Stanford\u2019s general counsel, pointing\nout that ambiguities in a contract must be construed against the drafter. But\nUSF fails to identify ambiguous language in the JDA. Relatedly, USF\nintimates that the JDA contains a latent ambiguity, requiring consideration\nof extrinsic evidence to determine whether the agreement is a broad waiver of\nany potential conflict relating to Vartain\u2019s representation of USF. (Citing\nFremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,\n114.) However, extrinsic evidence is admissible only when it is relevant to\nsupport a reasonable interpretation of the contract. (Brown v. Goldstien\n(2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 418, 432\u2013433.) USF\u2019s extrinsic evidence consists of\nstatements in Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration to the effect that USF was\nunwilling to consent to Vartain\u2019s concurrent representation of Community\nInitiatives in the wrongful termination case unless the JDA contained a\nconflict of interest waiver.4 This evidence pertains to USF\u2019s motivation for\n\n\n      4Similar statements appear in a declaration by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nDonna Davis. Davis states that she \u201callowed\u201d Vartain to represent\nCommunity Initiatives as a \u201ccourtesy to Stanford\u201d because she viewed\nStanford\u2019s and Community Initiatives\u2019 signatures on the JDA as an\n\n                                       19\n\fwaiving Vartain\u2019s separate conflict arising out of Vartain\u2019s concurrent\nrepresentation of clients with potentially adverse interests in the wrongful\ntermination case. It does not support USF\u2019s theory here that the JDA can be\nconstrued reasonably as a blanket waiver of all future attorney conflicts in\ncases involving these parties.\n      Shifting focus, USF appears to contend that Community Initiatives\nimpliedly consented to Vartain\u2019s adverse representation of USF by agreeing\nto present a joint defense with USF in the wrongful termination action. We\nhave a few problems with this argument, beginning with Cobra Solutions,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847, which states that the former client\u2019s informed\nwritten consent is required to waive a conflict arising out of successive\nrepresentation of the former client\u2019s adversary in a substantially related\nmatter. We note, however, that the disputed issue in Cobra Solutions\npertained to vicarious disqualification; whether a city attorney\u2019s admitted\nconflict of interest required disqualification of the entire government office.\n(Id. at p. 848.) Because there was no contention in Cobra Solutions that the\nformer clients consented to the conflict, that decision does not squarely hold\nthat informed consent to an otherwise disqualifying attorney conflict must be\nin writing.\n      USF cites Antelope Valley, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at pp. 619\u2013624, for\nthe proposition that consent to an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest can be\nimplied. We note that the conflict of interest analyzed in Antelope Valley\narose from an attorney\u2019s concurrent representation of clients with adverse\ninterests (id. at pp. 616\u2013617), but even if the same analysis were to apply in\ncases of successive representation (see id. at pp. 619, 621\u2013625), we conclude\n\n\n\nassurance that those parties would have no basis for disqualifying Vartain\nfrom representing USF.\n\n                                       20\n\fthat Antelope Valley does not support USF\u2019s argument under the facts\npresented here.\n      Antelope Valley involved multiple consolidated lawsuits arising from a\nprotracted dispute about water rights. (Antelope Valley, supra, 30\nCal.App.5th at p. 608.) The law firm Best Best & Krieger, LLP (BB&K)\nundertook to represent a water district defendant in the consolidated\nproceedings, while it was simultaneously representing a water contractor in\nother matters. (Id. at pp. 609\u2013610.) The water contractor also had an\ninterest in the consolidated proceedings, and, at some point, it was named as\na cross-defendant by an unrelated party. The water contractor retained the\nBrunick law firm to represent it in the consolidated proceedings, while\ncontinuing to use BB&K to represent it in other matters. (Id. at p. 611.)\nMore than 10 years later, the water contractor terminated its relationship\nwith BB&K and filed a motion to disqualify BB&K from continuing to\nrepresent the water district in the consolidated proceedings, claiming for the\nfirst time that the concurrent representation was a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest. (Id. at p. 613.) The trial court denied the motion, finding that the\nwater contractor impliedly consented to BB&K\u2019s concurrent representation of\nthe water district by accepting BB&K\u2019s advice on other matters for more than\n10 years without ever objecting to the concurrent representation. (Id. at\npp. 613\u2013614.)\n      On appeal, the Antelope Valley court affirmed the order denying the\ndisqualification motion on two independent grounds. First, the finding that\nthe water contractor impliedly consented to the concurrent representations\nwas supported by substantial evidence. (Id. at pp. 618 & 625.) Rejecting a\ncontention that the absence of the water contractor\u2019s written consent was\ndispositive, the Antelope Valley court held that \u201ca trial court may deny a\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fdisqualification motion when it finds the moving party by its conduct gave\nknowing and informed consent to the concurrent representation of\nthemselves and another client.\u201d (Id. at p. 625.) Alternatively, the court\nfound that even if implied consent was insufficient, the water contractor\nwaived its right to bring a disqualification motion by failing to bring the\nmotion within a reasonable time. (Id. at pp. 625\u2013626.)\n      Like the Antelope Valley court, we affirm a trial court ruling on a\ndisqualification matter because it is supported by substantial evidence. If we\nwere to assume, as the Antelope Valley court did, that informed consent to an\notherwise disqualifying conflict of interest can be implied from conduct, that\nfactor would not alter our conclusion that the disqualification order is\nsupported by substantial evidence. In contrast to the situation in Antelope\nValley, in this case there is no concrete evidence that the party asserting a\nconflict of interest knowingly participated in the arrangement for years\nwithout objection. USF\u2019s theory that Community Initiatives impliedly\nconsented to Vartain\u2019s conflict is based on the same evidence that USF uses\nto argue express consent, i.e., the fact that Community Initiatives signed the\nJDA. As explained, the language of the JDA and the factual circumstances of\nthis case support finding that the JDA was an agreement to share defense\nevidence, not to waive all potential future attorney conflicts of interest.\n      USF contends that if Community Initiatives did not impliedly consent\nto Vartain\u2019s conflict, it impliedly waived its right to bring a motion to\ndisqualify Vartain. \u201c \u2018[A]ttorney disqualification can be impliedly waived by\nfailing to bring the motion in a timely manner.\u2019 [Citation.] As explained by\none court, \u2018it is not in the interests of justice to make the \u201csubstantial\nrelationship\u201d rule so unyielding as to permit the former client to inexcusably\npostpone objections without penalty. Therefore, a narrow exception should\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fapply if the present client, by way of opposition, offers prima facie evidence of\nan unreasonable delay by the former client in making the motion and\nresulting prejudice to the current client.\u2019 [Citation.] To operate as a waiver,\nhowever, the \u2018delay [and] . . . the prejudice to the opponent must be extreme.\u2019\n[Citations.] If the opposing party makes a prima facie showing of extreme\ndelay and prejudice, the burden then shifts to the moving party to justify the\ndelay.\u201d (Fiduciary Trust Internat. of California v. Superior Court (2013) 218\nCal.App.4th 465, 490.)\n      Consistent with these principles, the Antelope Valley court found\n\u201cample justification\u201d for finding that the water contractor\u2019s delay in bringing\na disqualification motion was unreasonable and extremely prejudicial.\n(Antelope Valley, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 626.) The court based this\nconclusion on evidence that the water contractor waited 10 years to bring the\nmotion while reaping \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d from BB&K\u2019s representation of\nthe water district during that same period; that the water district would\nsuffer substantial financial cost if required to replace BB&K; and that the\ncourts and other interested parties would also be harmed by BB&K\u2019s removal\nfrom the ongoing litigation. (Id. at p. 626.)\n      In contrast to Antelope Valley, in this case USF failed to make a prima\nfacie showing of unreasonable delay or extreme prejudice. Again, it relies\nprimarily on Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration. Mr. Vartain states that for\nseveral months before and after the current lawsuit was filed, he spent\nconsiderable time attempting to negotiate a settlement with the attorneys\nrepresenting Stanford and Community Initiatives, and nobody complained\nabout a conflict of interest. In our view, the time Vartain spent on settlement\nefforts on behalf of USF is not evidence that Community Initiatives engaged\nin unreasonable delay. The record contains ample evidence that once Vartain\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fmade the decision to sue its former client, Community Initiatives acted\npromptly to address Vartain\u2019s conflict. Community Initiatives was served\nwith process in July 2022 and filed its motion to disqualify Vartain five\nmonths later.\n         Regarding prejudice, Mr. Vartain posits that no other attorney can\nadequately replace him in the pending indemnity action. He states, for\nexample, that he represents USF in most if not all litigation that is filed in\nSan Francisco, that he has \u201cthousands of attorney hours of experience\nworking on this lawsuit,\u201d and that his institutional knowledge of USF is \u201cnot\nreplaceable.\u201d This glowing review is corroborated by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nbut it is not evidence of prejudice attributable to Community Initiatives.\nDespite Vartain\u2019s close relationship with USF, they elected to represent\nCommunity Initiatives in a prior, substantially related matter. Promptly\nafter Vartain\u2019s decision to sue Community Initiatives on behalf of USF in the\npending action, Community Initiatives asserted the conflict and filed a\ndisqualification motion. Thus, it neither consented to nor waived its right to\nobject to Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest.\n                                                DISPOSITION\n          The order is affirmed.

The\nsuperior court issued a series of ex parte 20-day protective orders followed by a long-\nterm protective order.\n\f             The man appealed the long-term protective order, arguing in part that the\nsuperior court lacked the personal or subject matter jurisdiction necessary to grant such\nan order against someone who had never set foot in the state. Although we reject the\nman\u2019s argument about subject matter jurisdiction, we agree that the superior court\nlacked the personal jurisdiction necessary to justify an order imposing affirmative and\nlong-term obligations on an out-of-state respondent who has no contacts with Alaska.\nWe have already issued a summary order vacating the long-term protective order; this\nopinion explains our reasoning.\n      FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      A.     Facts\n             Jason Armstrong and Lacie Chance are the parents of a five-year-old\ndaughter. They never married, but at the time of the superior court proceedings they\nhad been in a relationship for eight years. They lived together in California until late\nApril 2022, when Chance left with their daughter and relocated to Wrangell.\n             The day after Chance arrived in Alaska, she filed a petition for a domestic\nviolence protective order (DVPO) against Armstrong in the superior court in Wrangell.\nThe petition sought both a 20-day protective order and a long-term protective order\n(typically of one-year duration). The petition alleged \u201cabout 7 years\u201d of domestic\nviolence, including physical and mental abuse of both Chance and her daughter. The\npetition requested temporary custody of the daughter, asked that Armstrong be awarded\nno visitation, and asked for no child support.\n      B.     Proceedings\n             The superior court issued a 20-day protective order on April 28, 2022,\nfinding probable cause to believe that Armstrong had committed or attempted to\ncommit assault or reckless endangerment. The order granted temporary custody of the\nparties\u2019 daughter to Chance and denied Armstrong any visitation rights because of a\nperceived risk to the safety of Chance and the child. The order set a hearing on Chance\u2019s\nrequest for a long-term protective order for May 17.\n\n                                           -2-                                     7681\n\f              Meanwhile, Armstrong pursued his own remedy in California.             The\nCalifornia superior court granted his ex parte application on May 13, issuing a\ntemporary emergency order for the return of the child to Armstrong\u2019s custody in\nCalifornia and setting a hearing for June 6.\n              The Alaska hearing began on May 17 and continued over four days.\nArmstrong appeared telephonically and by videoconference through his California\nattorney. Both parties presented witnesses. Armstrong maintained throughout the\nproceedings that the Alaska courts did not have jurisdiction over the matter because he\nhad never been to Alaska and all the alleged acts of domestic violence happened in\nCalifornia. The court overruled Armstrong\u2019s jurisdictional objections, finding it had\n\u201ctemporary jurisdiction at least [to] the extent for [the court] to hear the domestic\nviolence claims,\u201d and acknowledging that Armstrong had preserved the issue for\nappeal.\n              Armstrong appealed both the superior court\u2019s factual findings and its\nassertion of subject matter and personal jurisdiction. He asked that we vacate the\nsuperior court\u2019s judgment and reverse the long-term protective order. We concluded\nthat the Alaska court did not have personal jurisdiction over Armstrong, and we\ntherefore vacated the DVPO in a summary order with an explanation to follow.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              \u201cWe apply our independent judgment to questions of law, including\nstatutory interpretation.\u201d 1   \u201cWe review questions regarding both subject matter\njurisdiction and personal jurisdiction de novo, as \u2018[j]urisdictional issues are questions\n\n\n\n\n       1\n              Mitchell v.

We\nreject Armstrong\u2019s first argument but agree with his second.4\n       A.     The Superior Court Had Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Chance\u2019s\n              Domestic Violence Petition.\n              Subject matter jurisdiction is \u201cthe legal authority of a court to hear and\ndecide a particular type of case.\u201d5 In Alaska the superior court \u201cis the trial court of\ngeneral jurisdiction, with original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters.\u201d6 The\nstatute defining the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction states expressly that \u201ca petition for a\nprotective order under AS 18.66.100\u201318.66.180\u201d is \u201can action that falls within the\n\n\n\n\n       2\n             S.B. v.

Ha, 591 P.2d 1281, 1284 n.6 (Alaska 1979).\n       4\n             In support of its assertion of jurisdiction, the superior court cited the\ntemporary emergency jurisdiction provision of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction\nand Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), codified in Alaska as AS 25.30.330. Armstrong\ndisagrees with this interpretation of AS 25.30.330. Since our finding that the court had\nsubject matter jurisdiction is based on other grounds, we need not address these\narguments.\n       5\n           Hawkins v. Attatayuk, 322 P.3d 891, 894 (Alaska 2014) (quoting Nw.\nMed. Imaging, Inc. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 151 P.3d 434, 438 (Alaska 2006)).\n       6\n              AS 22.10.020(a) (emphasis added).\n\n                                            -4-                                       7681\n\fconcurrent jurisdiction of the superior court and the district court\u201d and thus may be filed\nin either.7\n              Consistent with these jurisdictional statutes, AS 18.66.100(a) provides\nthat \u201c[a] person who is or has been a victim of a crime involving domestic violence may\nfile a petition in the district or superior court for a protective order against a household\nmember.\u201d8 The appropriate venue is mandated by rule.9 Alaska Civil Rule 3(h)\nprovides:\n              A petition or request for a protective order on domestic violence\n              under AS 18.66 or a protective order on stalking or sexual assault\n              under AS 18.65 may be filed in either the judicial district or the\n              court location closest to\n                 (1) where the petitioner currently or temporarily resides;\n                 (2) where the respondent resides; or\n                 (3) where the domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault\n                    occurred.\n              Other than these venue restrictions \u2014 not at issue here, as it is undisputed\nthat Chance filed her petition in \u201cthe judicial district . . . where [she] currently or\ntemporarily reside[d]\u201d \u2014 no Alaska statute or rule limits an Alaska trial court\u2019s subject\nmatter jurisdiction over domestic violence claims. This is with good reason, as many\n\n\n\n\n       7\n             Id.; see also AS 22.15.030(a)(10) (providing for district court jurisdiction\n\u201cover cases involving protective orders for domestic violence under AS 18.66.100\u2013\n18.66.180\u201d).\n       8\n             See also AS 22.10.020(a) (noting concurrent jurisdiction of superior court\nand district court over \u201ca petition for a protective order under AS 18 66.100\u2013\n18.66.180\u201d).\n       9\n             See AS 22.10.030 (\u201cVenue for all actions shall be set under rules adopted\nby the supreme court.\u201d).\n\n                                            -5-                                       7681\n\fother courts have recognized: \u201c[A] state has the legitimate right to protect anyone\nwithin its borders from abuse regardless of the geographical source of the abuse.\u201d10\n             In support of his contrary position, Armstrong cites the United States\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion in Williams v. North Carolina,11 which he suggests stands for\nthe proposition that due process requires the petitioner to be domiciled in the state in\nwhich the petition is filed. Williams did not involve a domestic violence petition; in\nWilliams the Supreme Court held that North Carolina was constitutionally required to\ngive full faith and credit to a Nevada divorce when there was no dispute that the parties\nhad been domiciled in Nevada when divorced, as required by Nevada law.12 The Court\nexpressly avoided deciding whether the same full faith and credit should be accorded a\ndivorce granted to parties who were temporary residents of Nevada as opposed to\ndomiciled there; 13 the case thus has nothing to offer on the question of whether\ntemporary residence in a state is enough to allow the state\u2019s courts to adjudicate a\npetition for a domestic violence restraining order.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n               Shah v. Shah, 875 A.2d 931, 938 (N.J. 2005) (noting that while Georgia\nand Illinois \u201cstatutorily prohibit the filing of a domestic violence complaint against a\nnon-resident defendant when there has been no proof of any in-state domestic violence,\n. . . the overwhelming majority of states protect a victim of domestic violence while she\nis in the state, regardless of where the abuse occurred\u201d). The court in Shah identifies\nAlaska as one of the states whose statutes \u201care silent as to both venue and personal\njurisdiction in domestic violence matters\u201d and therefore \u201cdefault to their general venue\nprovisions.\u201d Id. at 938 n.4.\n      11\n             317 U.S. 287 (1942).\n      12\n             Id. at 302-03.\n      13\n             Id. at 302 (stating that because the Court \u201cmust assume that petitioners\nhad a bona fide domicil in Nevada,\u201d there was \u201cno question on the present record\nwhether a divorce decree granted by the courts of one state to a resident as distinguished\nfrom a domiciliary is entitled to full faith and credit in another state\u201d).\n\n                                           -6-                                      7681\n\f              Alaska\u2019s divorce statutes require that at least one spouse be a resident at\nthe time a divorce action is commenced in the state. 14 The DVPO statutes, on the other\nhand, make no mention of a residency requirement, and we see no other indication that\nthe legislature intended there to be one. Indeed, such a requirement would run afoul of\nwhat we now expressly recognize as Alaska\u2019s \u201clegitimate right to protect anyone within\nits borders from abuse regardless of the geographical source of the abuse.\u201d 15 We\ntherefore conclude that the superior court had the subject matter jurisdiction necessary\nto consider Chance\u2019s petition for a long-term DVPO.\n         B.   The Superior Court Did Not Have Personal Jurisdiction Over\n              Armstrong And Therefore Could Not Grant A Long-Term DVPO\n              Against Him.\n              Our holding that the superior court properly exercised subject matter\njurisdiction over Chance\u2019s DVPO petition requires us to answer a second question: Did\nthe court have the personal jurisdiction necessary to bind Armstrong? Our answer is\nthat it did not, given the prohibitions and obligations the order contained.\n              1.    The superior court lacked personal jurisdiction over\n                    Armstrong because he has no contacts with the state.\n              \u201cAlaska\u2019s long-arm statute, AS 09.05.015, lays out a list of circumstances\nunder which personal jurisdiction may be exercised.\u201d16 The list is not exclusive; the\n\n\n\n         14\n              AS 25.24.420 (\u201cOne of the parties to a complaint for legal separation must\nbe a resident of the state at the time the action is commenced.\u201d); see also AS 25.24.090\n(allowing out-of-state spouse to file for divorce in Alaska if defendant spouse is Alaska\nresident). \u201cResidency\u201d under Alaska law is conceptually similar to the domiciliary\nrequirement at issue in Williams. See Williams, 317 U.S. at 298 (observing that \u201cit\nseems clear that the provision of the Nevada statute that a plaintiff in this type of case\nmust \u2018reside\u2019 in the State for the required period requires him to have a domicil as\ndistinguished from a mere residence in the state\u201d).\n         15\n              Shah, 875 A.2d at 938.\n         16\n              See Alaska Telecomm., Inc. v.

General jurisdiction requires that the defendant be domiciled in the forum\nstate, 21 while specific jurisdiction requires that the defendant have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d\nwith the forum state.22 The minimum contacts analysis \u201cusually means that the party\n\n\n\n         17\n             AS 09.05.015(c) (\u201cThe jurisdictional grounds stated in (a)(2)-(10) of this\nsection are cumulative and in addition to any other grounds provided by the common\nlaw.\u201d).\n         18\n              Polar Supply Co., v.

But that is not the end of the inquiry, as there is a split among state courts with\nregard to what exactly due process requires in the context of DVPO litigation. Some\nstates require personal jurisdiction to the same extent as they would in any other civil\nmatter, while others waive the usual jurisdictional requirements for DVPOs as long as\nthe order imposes no affirmative duties on the respondent.

The DVPO both prohibits certain conduct and imposes certain\n                     affirmative obligations. 25\n              The order at issue here, like all long-term DVPOs that follow the Alaska\nCourt System\u2019s standardized form,26 both prohibits certain conduct by the respondent\nand imposes on him certain affirmative obligations.            Armstrong is specifically\nprohibited from \u201cthreaten[ing] to commit or commit[ting] acts of domestic violence,\nstalking or harassment\u201d and \u201ctelephon[ing], contact[ing], or communicat[ing] in any\nway, directly or indirectly, with petitioner except . . . [b]y telephone or text message for\npurposes of facilitating child custody visitation as provided for in the California custody\n[order].\u201d Armstrong is prohibited from serving legal papers \u201cabout any other case\ninvolving the parties\u201d (emphasis in original) except \u201cthrough a process server while this\ndomestic violence order is in effect,\u201d unless the court first modifies the order at\nArmstrong\u2019s request. He is also prohibited from coming within 50 feet of Chance\u2019s\nresidence and from \u201center[ing], follow[ing], or interfer[ing] with the operation of any\nvehicle occupied by [Chance] or in [her] possession.\u201d\n              The order goes on to warn Armstrong of its various impacts and potential\nconsequences: \u201cYou can be arrested without a warrant for violating this order after you\nare served\u201d; \u201c[i]f you possess a firearm or ammunition while this order is in effect, you\nmay be charged with a federal offense even if [the order\u2019s express provisions] do not\nprohibit you from possessing these items\u201d; and \u201c[i]f you are convicted of assault in the\nfourth degree committed in violation of this order, you will be sentenced to at least 20\ndays in jail.\u201d The order also requires Armstrong (as well as Chance) to notify the court\n\n\n\n       25\n              As noted above, we previously vacated the long-term protective order by\nsummary order. For purposes of this opinion, however, we provide our explanation and\nanalysis as though the order were still in effect.\n       26\n              See Long-Term Domestic Violence Protective Order (One Petitioner),\nForm DV-105 (5\/23), ALASKA COURT SYSTEM (on file with court). The standard form\nused in this matter was a previous version, Form DV-105 (1\/21) (also on file with court).\n\n                                           -10-                                       7681\n\fin writing of \u201c[a]ny changes in address or telephone numbers\u201d and of \u201c[p]ending civil\ncourt actions and domestic violence criminal actions involving either the respondent or\nthe petitioner\u201d as long as the order remains in effect. And the order may last a long\ntime: Those aspects of the order that \u201cprohibit[] the respondent from committing or\nthreatening to commit acts of domestic violence, stalking or harassment, will remain in\neffect indefinitely, until dissolved by court order.\u201d\n                In sum, although the order is largely prohibitory, it also requires\nArmstrong to do certain things even though he may never appear in Alaska. For\nexample, he must limit his long-distance contacts with Chance to certain modes and\ncertain subjects, serve Chance only through a process server in any litigation between\nthem, advise the Alaska court of any changes of address or phone number, and advise\nthe Alaska court of any pending civil or \u201cdomestic violence criminal actions involving\neither\u201d party. And the order has serious consequences not only if Armstrong violates it\nbut even if he fully complies with it; most notably, as long as the order is in effect, he\nis prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms and ammunition.27\n                Recognizing the State\u2019s strong interest in protecting persons within its\nborders from abuse, we still must determine whether Alaska\u2019s courts may impose these\nprohibitions and obligations on a respondent over whom Alaska\u2019s courts lack personal\njurisdiction.\n                3.    Several states have allowed DVPOs even absent personal\n                      jurisdiction insofar as the orders are only prohibitory.\n                Some courts that allow DVPOs against absent defendants despite due\nprocess objections have reasoned that such an order can be characterized as a \u201cstatus\ndetermination\u201d for which personal jurisdiction is not necessary. In Bartsch v. Bartsch,\nfor example, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed a protective order granted against the\nplaintiff\u2019s out-of-state husband, relying in part on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\n\n\n       27\n                18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8).\n\n                                           -11-                                     7681\n\fWilliams that personal jurisdiction is not necessary in certain cases that simply\ndetermine the status of the in-state litigant rather than enter judgment against the absent\nlitigant. 28 The Bartsch court observed that a protective order was just such a \u201cstatus\ndetermination,\u201d as it \u201cmerely ordered the defendant to \u2018stay away from the protected\nparty\u2019 and not assault or communicate with her, in furtherance of the State\u2019s strong\ninterest in protecting Iowa residents from domestic abuse.\u201d29 Noting that many courts\nallow orders affecting marriage, custody, and parental rights even absent personal\njurisdiction over one party, the court explained:\n             The greater and more immediate risk of harm from domestic\n             violence, as opposed to the \u201cconsiderable interest in preventing\n             bigamous marriages and in protecting the offspring in marriages\n             from being [illegitimate]\u201d in dissolution proceedings, . . . makes\n             application of the status exception to protective orders even more\n             compelling than in dissolution actions. Indeed, the State\u2019s interest\n             in protecting victims of domestic abuse is equal to, if not greater\n             than, its interest in actions determining child custody or terminating\n             parental rights because it involves the safety of the protected\n             parties.[30]\n             The New Jersey Supreme Court followed a similar path in Shah v. Shah,\nholding that its trial courts could enter temporary orders prohibiting acts of domestic\nviolence even absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant so long as the orders did\n\n\n\n\n      28\n              Bartsch v. Bartsch, 636 N.W.2d 3, 6-10 (Iowa 2001); see also Shaffer v.\nHeitner, 433 U.S. 186, 208 n.30 (1977) (recognizing that certain jurisdictional rules\n\u201csuch as the particularized rules governing adjudication of status\u201d are not \u201cinconsistent\nwith the standard of fairness\u201d); S.B., 61 P.3d at 14 (observing that \u201c[t]he majority of\ncourts that have addressed the issue have held that child custody proceedings conducted\nunder the jurisdictional rules of the UCCJA fit within Shaffer\u2019s \u2018status\u2019 exception,\nmeaning that personal jurisdiction over non-consenting parties is not required\u201d).\n      29\n             636 N.W.2d at 10.\n      30\n            Id. at 9 (alteration in original) (quoting In re Kimura, 471 N.W.2d 869,\n875 (Iowa 1991)).\n\n                                           -12-                                       7681\n\fnot require any affirmative acts of the defendant. 31 The court reasoned that such a\nprohibitory order was \u201caddressed not to the defendant but to the victim: it provides the\nvictim the very protection the law specifically allows, and it prohibits the defendant\nfrom engaging in behavior already specifically outlawed.\u201d32\n              We largely agree with the rationale of these cases: A domestic violence\nprotective order issued without personal jurisdiction over the absent respondent, but\nwhich does nothing but grant the petitioner a protected status within Alaska\u2019s borders,\ndoes not violate the absent respondent\u2019s right to due process.\n              4.     We join the several states that require personal jurisdiction\n                     over the defendant for a long-term, non-emergency DVPO to\n                     be granted.\n              The order at issue here establishes more than just Chance\u2019s status as a\nprotected person under Alaska law. As explained above, it also imposes significant and\npotentially long-lasting restrictions and obligations on Armstrong: it restricts his right\n\n\n       31\n              875 A.2d 931, 940 n.5, 942 (N.J. 2005).\n       32\n              Id. at 939. The court in Shah also noted the existence of a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nprovision in the state\u2019s domestic violence statute, allowing the petitioner to file the\npetition \u201cin a court having jurisdiction over the place . . . where the plaintiff resides or\nis sheltered.\u201d Id. at 936 (quoting N.J.

Donovan, 879 N.E.2d\n117, 123, 125 (Mass. 2008) (explaining that protective order which \u201cprohibits the\ndefendant from abusing the plaintiff and orders him to have no contact with and to stay\naway from her . . . serves a role analogous to custody or marital determinations, except\nthat the order focuses on the plaintiff\u2019s protected status rather than [the plaintiff\u2019s]\nmarital or parental status\u201d); Hemenway v. Hemenway, 992 A.2d 575, 580-82 (N.H.\n2010) (affirming final protective order \u201cto the extent that it protects the wife from abuse,\nbut revers[ing] to the extent that the order requires affirmative action from the\ndefendant\u201d).\n\n                                           -13-                                       7681\n\fto communicate with Chance even by phone, text, and email from California; mandates\na method of service in \u201cany other case involving the parties\u201d; requires notice to the\nAlaska court of any changes of address or phone number and the pendency of other\ncivil or \u201cdomestic violence criminal\u201d litigation involving the parties; and restricts\nArmstrong\u2019s gun ownership.        Violation of any of these terms could carry harsh\nconsequences. We conclude that an order containing these terms violates due process\nif entered in the absence of personal jurisdiction over the respondent.\n              In Mannise v. Harrell, the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that a\ntrial court cannot enter a DVPO absent personal jurisdiction over the respondent\nbecause such an order \u201cinvolves both legal and non-legal collateral consequences[,]\u201d\nincluding impacts on custody proceedings and job prospects. 33 The order \u201cmay also\nplace restrictions on where a defendant may or may not be located, or what personal\nproperty a defendant may possess or use.\u201d 34 The order at issue in Mannise, for example,\n\u201cimplicate[d] substantial rights of Defendant, including visitation with and the care,\ncustody, and control of his minor son, or access to the schools he is attending.\u201d 35 The\nplaintiff was therefore required to prove that the North Carolina courts had personal\njurisdiction over the defendant. 36 \u201cTo hold otherwise would violate Due Process and\n\u2018offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d37\n              The North Carolina Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in Mucha\nv. Wagner, declining to extend the status exception to a petition for a DVPO against a\ndefendant over whom the state\u2019s courts lacked personal jurisdiction. 38 The court\n\n\n       33\n              791 S.E.2d 653, 660 (N.C.

By\n             contrast, when a trial court enters a DVPO, the court creates\n             a \u201cstatus\u201d which did not previously exist and then invokes\n             that newly-created status to \u201cprohibit[ the defendant] from\n             engaging in behavior that would be entirely legal but for the\n             court\u2019s order.\u201d[40]\nThe Mucha court also cited Mannise, echoing the same concerns about the impacts to\nsubstantive rights of defendants and other collateral consequences, and noting further\nthat even a DVPO which appears on its face to be merely prohibitory may still impose\naffirmative obligations on a defendant.41 For example, compliance with the DVPO\nmight require the defendant to vacate a home or surrender possession of shared\nresidences or personal property to the plaintiff.42 The court concluded that these\n\u201cfairness concerns\u201d required a court to have personal jurisdiction over the defendant\nbefore issuing a DVPO. 43\n             We share these fairness concerns.

Even prohibitory\norders may come with long-distance consequences.45 For example, both federal law46\nand California law 47 prohibit persons subject to a DVPO from possessing firearms\nwhile the DVPO is in effect, and certain aspects of Alaska\u2019s standard DVPO \u201cremain\nin effect indefinitely, until dissolved by court order.\u201d And California, where custody of\nthe parties\u2019 daughter is being litigated, applies a rebuttable presumption against custody\nby a party found to have \u201cperpetrated domestic violence within the previous five years\nagainst the other party seeking custody of the child.\u201d48 The effect of the long-term\nDVPO against Armstrong could thus reach well beyond Alaska\u2019s borders even if we\ncould characterize it as merely prohibitory.\n              To be clear, this opinion does not curtail trial courts\u2019 ability to exercise\ntemporary jurisdiction on an emergency basis to issue ex parte protective orders where\n\u201cthe petition establishes probable cause that a crime involving domestic violence has\noccurred, it is necessary to protect the petitioner from domestic violence, and . . . the\npetitioner has certified to the court . . . the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide\n\n\n\n\n       44\n             See, e.g., Shah v.

Addington\n\n\n                                 EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER\n\n\n       Jeff Emerson worked as firefighter for the City of Cookeville, Tennessee for twenty-\nfour years. During his employment, he developed colorectal cancer and filed a claim for\nworkers\u2019 compensation benefits, which Cookeville eventually denied. The question is\nwhether Mr. Emerson\u2019s work was the primary cause of his cancer. The Court held a hearing\non January 9, 2024, and holds that Mr. Emerson is not likely to prove that his work was\nthe primary cause of his cancer.\n                                              Claim History\n\n       As part of his job with Cookeville, Mr. Emerson underwent yearly physicals by Dr.\nToney Hudson through its voluntary program. Unfortunately, in November 2021, a colon\ncancer screen detected cancerous cells, and Mr. Emerson notified Cookeville.\n\n      Dr. Hudson referred Mr. Emerson to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy, which\nfound cancer. The gastroenterologist referred Mr. Emerson to oncologist Dr. Algis Sidrys,\nwho ordered chemotherapy and radiation, and now Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer is in remission.1\n\n       After receiving notice, Cookeville offered Mr. Emerson a panel, and he chose Dr.\nHudson. Cookeville asked Dr. Hudson for a causation opinion on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer.\nDr. Hudson responded that another oncologist, Dr. Venumada Kotla, would be better suited\nto give an opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n    Mr. Emerson received this care through his personal health insurance.\n\n                                                      1\n\f       At Cookeville\u2019s request, Dr. Kotla saw Mr. Emerson and gave a causation\nstatement. He wrote: \u201cIn my best clinical judgment, it would not be possible to assign a\nnumerical risk of causation of 50% or more given the limitations of available epidemiologic\ndata.\u201d He assigned the causative effect of Mr. Emerson\u2019s work on his cancer at thirty\npercent. Cookeville denied Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim based on the assessment.\n\n       In response, Mr. Emerson asked Dr. Sidrys to address causation. Dr. Sidrys noted:\n\n       Given the lack of other risk factors for Mr. Emerson and given the clear proof\n       that firefighters are at an increased risk of GI cancers, specifically rectal\n       cancers, I do believe that Mr. Emerson\u2019s employment as a fireman has a\n       significant (greater than 51%) chance of having been a causative agent in his\n       malignancy.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        Mr. Emerson testified that he was exposed to toxins from structure, vehicle, and\nbrush fires. He gave approximate monthly numbers for each type of incident. He said that\nhe ate grilled red meat in moderation and drank from twelve to twenty beers a week. He\nquit smoking fourteen years ago but smoked a pack and a half daily before. He testified\nthat during his employment, he often got soot on his work uniform, was exposed to diesel\nexhaust fumes, and inhaled smoke from various types of fires. He said that he regularly\nexercised to stay in shape for his job. He requested medical and temporary benefits for his\ninjury.\n\n       Cookeville, through the affidavit of its human resource director, asserted that Dr.\nKotla was Mr. Emerson\u2019s authorized treating physician, and that it had properly denied his\nclaim after Dr. Kotla gave his opinion.\n\n      The parties also obtained expert medical opinions from two other physicians, Dr.\nDanny Whu (Mr. Emerson), and Dr. Sarkis Chobanian (Cookeville). Both doctors\nacknowledged that they do not know the cause of Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but gave their\nopinion based on risk factors to which they believed his work exposed him.\n\n       Dr. Whu is a retired firefighter and physician who serves as the Chief Medical\nOfficer of the International Association of Firefighters. He is an advocate for firefighters\nacross the nation. He prepared a report on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer and testified by\ndeposition.\n\n       In his report, he stated he reviewed literature on the subject, Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ntreatment records, and colorectal cancer generally. He found an absence of non-work-\nrelated risk factors and pointed out Mr. Emerson\u2019s job exposed him to multiple\ncarcinogens. He ended his report by saying \u201chis occupation as a fire fighter resulted in a\n\n                                             2\n\fnumerical risk value greater than 51% specific to his development of rectal cancer.\u201d He\nalso equated Mr. Emerson\u2019s exposure to \u201ceasily\u201d greater than 51% and then explained that\nTennessee law does not require a preponderance of evidence because the law provides a\npresumption that his cancer was caused by his work. He also stated that the benefit of the\ndoubt should be found in Mr. Emerson\u2019s favor.2\n\n       Dr. Whu further testified that in his job he advocates for firefighters to receive the\nbenefits they were due and testified before legislative bodies to help accomplish the unions\ngoals. He firmly stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary risk that caused his cancer\nand discounted other risk factors.\n\n       Dr. Chobanian is a board-certified gastroenterologist. He has performed over\n100,000 colonoscopies in his career. Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian a significant fee for\nhis time spent on the file and his trial testimony.\n\n        He testified in person that more likely Mr. Emerson\u2019s colorectal cancer was caused\nby the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which a colon lining cell mutates and becomes\nmore and more abnormal until it becomes cancerous. He excluded genetic causes because\npathologists found none during Mr. Emerson\u2019s treatment. He noted that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ncolon contained another non-cancerous polyp, which the surgeon removed, different from\nthe cancer in his lower colon \u0336 which shows the process had also started in the front of his\ncolon. He acknowledged Mr. Emerson\u2019s risk factor as a firefighter and determined that his\nfirefighting duties may have increased his risk of cancer but did not cause it. He also\ndiscussed Mr. Emerson\u2019s drinking and smoking and pointed out that they were significant\nrisk factors as well.\n\n                          Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n        Mr. Emerson must show that he would likely prevail at a hearing on the merits that\nhis cancer and need for treatment arose primarily out of and in the course and scope of his\nemployment. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-6-239(d)(1), 50-6-102(12) (2023). Specifically, he\nmust show \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [the work] contributed more\nthan fifty percent (50%) in causing the . . . disablement or need for medical treatment,\nconsidering all causes.\u201d \u201cShown to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d means that,\nin the opinion of the treating physician, it is more likely than not considering all causes as\nopposed to speculation or possibility. Id. at -102(12)(C)-(D).\n\n       For his part, Mr. Emerson testified credibly about his employment and exposure to\nvarious toxins in the smoke from fires, soot that collected on his gear, and diesel exhaust\nfumes from the firetruck engines in the firehouse garage. He testified about the\n\n2\n Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony about presumptions in the workers\u2019 compensation law is inaccurate. The Court relies\non his report solely as to his understanding of Tennessee workers\u2019 compensation law.\n\n                                                   3\n\fapproximate times he fought structure fires, vehicle fires, and vegetation fires. However,\nhe did not supply exact information of this nature for the experts to consider. He also\ntestified about his diet, weight, smoking, and alcohol intake.\n\n       For medical causation, both parties relied on experts to support their contentions.\nAll four experts were competent to testify about Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition. 3 However,\nneither Dr. Sidrys or Kotla fully explained how they reached their conclusions, based on\nthe information they received from Mr. Emerson and from medical studies.\n       Dr. Whu provided helpful insight about firefighting and exposure to toxins.\nHowever, he is an advocate for firefighters nationwide, and his testimony can be construed\nas biased in favor of Mr. Emerson by that very role. He also did not have a correct\nunderstanding of the Tennessee Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, nor is he qualified to testify\nas to what the law means. For these reasons, the Court gives little weight to his causation\nanalysis.\n       Although Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian well for his opinion, he was unbiased as\nto his causation analysis. He reviewed each risk factor and testified that some were\nmitigated, and others were more serious. He reasoned that it is impossible to say for sure\nwhat caused Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but most likely the major cause was the adenoma-\ncarcinoma sequence.\n        In summary of the experts\u2019 causation opinions, Dr. Sidrys stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\njob had a significant chance of being \u201ca\u201d causative agent of his cancer. (Emphasis added.)\nHe did not say that his job \u201cprimarily\u201d caused his cancer but only that it was a main risk,\nand the opinion contains an impermissible degree of speculation. Dr. Kotla assigned a\nthirty-percent risk to his job as causing Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but did not adequately\nexplain how arrived at this numeric value. It too seems speculative. Dr. Whu assigned over\nfifty-one percent, but as explained above his opinion carries little weight. In contrast, Dr.\nChobanian, whom the Court fully accredits, considered the risk factors and assigned them\nan appropriate weight. He found that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was not the primary risk factor of\nhis cancer.\n        Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job increased the\nrisk of him getting colorectal cancer, but the weight of the evidence does not establish that\nMr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary cause. The Court holds he is unlikely to prevail at a\n3\n Cookeville made two evidentiary objections to Mr. Emerson\u2019s medical experts. First, the City moved to\nexclude Dr. Sidrys\u2019s and Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony due to speculation. The Court overrules the motion, as both\ndoctors explained that they did not just speculate but evaluated the risk factors for Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition.\nSecond, Cookeville moved to exclude Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony based on a violation of Tennessee Rules of\nCivil Procedure 34.02 (2023) and his unauthorized investigation of fire stations. Neither Mr. Emerson nor\nhis attorney asked Dr. Whu to conduct these investigations. Dr. Whu did not obtain permission from\nCookeville\u2019s attorney to conduct the investigation. The Court grants the motion in part and excludes only\nhis testimony about and pictures of his investigation of the local fire stations.\n\n\n                                                      4\n\fhearing on the merits in proving that his cancer and the need for treatment arose primarily\nout of and in the course and scope of his employment.\n       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:\n       1. Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim against the City of Cookeville for the requested benefits is\n       denied at this time.\n\n       2. The Court sets a Status Hearing on March 19, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Central.

Ct. No. 15F03945)\n\n           v.\n\n ANTJUAN SYDNOR,\n\n                    Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n         In a prior opinion, we affirmed the murder conviction of defendant Antjuan\nSydnor but remanded for the trial court to consider its discretion to strike a firearm\nenhancement under then recently enacted Senate Bill No. 620 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.).\nOn remand, the trial court declined to strike the enhancement.\n         Defendant appeals, contending the trial court misinterpreted and misapplied Penal\nCode section 1385 and erred in not considering other interim sentencing changes under\nSenate Bill No. 567 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) and Assembly Bill No. 518 (2021-2022 Reg.\nSess.). (Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.)\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f       We conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in declining to strike\ndefendant\u2019s firearm enhancement but abused its discretion by failing to consider other\ninterim changes in the sentencing law. The sentence is vacated, and the matter remanded\nfor resentencing. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       Defendant and a codefendant entered the home of \u201cByron D., bound Byron and his\ngirlfriend, and forced them to the floor. [Defendant and the codefendant] then beat Byron\nwhile repeatedly asking him for money. Byron was shot in the head and killed when he\ndid not give them money.\u201d (People v. Sydnor (May 27, 2021, C085040, C085760)\n[nonpub. opn.] (Sydnor).) A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder with a\nrobbery special circumstance, robbery, and the enhancement of personally discharging a\nfirearm causing death for both counts (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)). The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to life without parole for the murder conviction plus 25 years to life for the\nfirearm enhancement. The court also sentenced defendant to the upper term of six years\nfor robbery but stayed that sentence, along with its firearm enhancement.\n       Defendant appealed, and we affirmed his convictions but remanded for the trial\ncourt to consider its discretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement. (Sydnor,\nsupra, C085040.)\n       In April 2022, the trial court held a hearing and noted this court \u201caffirmed the\nconviction but remanded to this Court solely to exercise the Court\u2019s discretion under the\nintervening legislation, [Senate Bill No.] 620, from 2017 that now gives the Court the\ndiscretion to strike the enhancement for personal discharge of a firearm causing\ndeath . . . . There is not a full resentencing.\u201d\n       At the hearing, the trial court pointed out to the People that \u201cone of the strongest\narguments\u201d by the defense was \u201cif there\u2019s already a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole, what does the additional 25-years-to-life add, other than it looks like\na sentence that would be imposed in Mississippi. For practical purposes, the Court has\n\n                                               2\n\fsentenced [defendant] to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d The People responded,\n\u201cthere is really no reason that the Court can cite to\u201d in section 1385 \u201cto allow something\nto be stricken in this case.\u201d The trial court then asked defense counsel if there were any\nmitigating circumstances, adding \u201cthis was a fairly cold-blooded killing. The victim was\nbound, tied in his own home[,] and then shot execution style. [Defendant] was on federal\nparole at the time.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cAll I can do is just submit the matter,\nyour Honor.\u201d\n       The trial court declined to exercise its discretion, explaining it had \u201ctwo reasons\nunder what I\u2019m calling the old traditional interest of justice analysis. Looking at the\ncircumstances of the crime, the fact that [defendant] was on federal parole at the time and\nconduct in prison, there are no mitigating circumstances that would argue it\u2019s in the\ninterest of justice to strike the enhancement. [\u00b6] Under a more specific analysis of the\nLegislature\u2019s amendment to [section] 1385[, subdivision ](c), I don\u2019t think this results in\na sentence that exceeds 20 years. Obviously it\u2019s life without, but I think the Legislature\nthere was talking about determinant sentencing; otherwise, the enhancement under\n12022.53[, subdivision ](d) could not be applied. But assuming for the sake of argument\nthat 20-year sentence is a mitigating factor, the Court would still find that dismissal could\nendanger public safety given the nature of the circumstances of this offense. I\u2019m going to\nnot exercise my discretion to resentence, and I\u2019m not modifying the sentence at all from\nthe remitt[itu]r.\u201d\n       Defendant timely appeals.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant contends the trial court violated three different statutes: (1) section\n1385, (2) Senate Bill No. 567\u2019s changes to section 1170; and (3) Assembly Bill No. 518\u2019s\nchanges to section 654. We review the trial court\u2019s sentencing decisions for an abuse of\ndiscretion (People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 847), but review alleged errors of\nlaw de novo (People v. Tran (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1217-1218).\n\n                                              3\n\f                                              I\n                                The Firearm Enhancement\n       Senate Bill No. 620 amended sections 12022.53 and 12022.5 to permit trial courts\nto strike these firearm enhancements in the interests of justice pursuant to section 1385.\n(\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (c), 12022.53, subd. (h).) Section 1385 subdivision (c)(1) states in\nrelevant part, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law, the court shall dismiss an enhancement if\nit is in the furtherance of justice to do so.\u201d Subdivision (c)(2) provides: \u201cIn exercising its\ndiscretion under this subdivision, the court shall consider and afford great weight to\nevidence offered by the defendant to prove that any of the mitigating circumstances in\nsubparagraphs (A) to (I) are present. Proof of the presence of one or more of these\ncircumstances weighs greatly in favor of dismissing the enhancement, unless the court\nfinds that dismissal of the enhancement would endanger public safety. \u2018Endanger public\nsafety\u2019 means there is a likelihood that the dismissal of the enhancement would result in\nphysical injury or other serious danger to others.\u201d One mitigating circumstance listed in\nsection 1385, subdivision (c)(2) is if \u201c[t]he application of an enhancement could result in\na sentence of over 20 years. In this instance, the enhancement shall be dismissed.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1385, subd. (c)(2)(C).)\n       First, defendant argues reversal is required under section 1385 because \u201cthe trial\ncourt misunderstood the scope of its discretion to strike or stay an enhancement under\nsection 1385, subdivision (c) when it found that it did not apply enhancements imposed\nupon indeterminate sentences.\u201d We disagree.\n       Defendant\u2019s argument rests on a misinterpretation of the plain language of the\nstatute. The mitigating circumstance he relies on states the \u201capplication of an\nenhancement could result in a sentence of over 20 years.\u201d (\u00a7 1385, subd. (c)(2)(C).)\nHere, the sentence could and likely will be a term of over 20 years, but independent from\nthe application of the enhancement. Defendant is subject to a life without parole sentence\nfor the murder conviction regardless of whether the enhancement is imposed.\n\n                                              4\n\f       Second, defendant argues that \u201c[i]f the court had determined to strike appellant\u2019s\nenhancement in total, appellant would still be incarcerated for the remainder of his life.\nThere is therefore no conceivable way that striking or reducing the enhancement would\nendanger public safety.\u201d But whether striking the enhancement would endanger public\nsafety is a consideration under subdivision (c)(2) that applies only if there is \u201c[p]roof of\nthe presence of one or more of these [mitigating] circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 1385, subd. (c)(2).)\nSince no mitigating circumstances are applicable, subdivision (c)(1)\u2019s \u201cfurtherance of\njustice\u201d analysis governed the trial court\u2019s discretion.\n       The furtherance of justice analysis is one often applied to discretionary sentencing\ndecisions. \u201c \u2018[G]enerally applicable sentencing principles\u2019 relevant to a court\u2019s\ndetermination of whether dismissal is in furtherance of justice \u2018relat[e] to matters such as\nthe defendant\u2019s background, character, and prospects.\u2019 [Citation.] Those principles\nrequire consideration of circumstances in mitigation (and aggravation) in the broader\ncontext of the recognized objectives of sentencing, which are not limited to public\nsafety.\u201d (People v. Ortiz (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1087, 1097.) In declining to strike the\nenhancement, the trial court found that defendant \u201cwas on federal parole at the time,\u201d and\nthere were \u201cno mitigating circumstances that would argue it\u2019s in the interest of justice to\nstrike the enhancement.\u201d Defendant does not argue this reflects an abuse of discretion\nunder the furtherance of justice analysis, nor can we make such a conclusion. We\ntherefore conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in declining to strike\ndefendant\u2019s firearm enhancement.\n                                              II\n                                 Other Sentencing Changes\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to apply Senate Bill No. 567 and\nAssembly Bill No. 518, both of which went into effect before the resentencing hearing on\nremand. Because defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not request consideration of these\nsentencing changes in the trial court, the claims were forfeited. We nevertheless exercise\n\n                                              5\n\four discretion to reach the merits of these claims to eliminate the need to address\ndefendant\u2019s alternative ineffective assistance of counsel claim. (People v. Crittenden\n(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 146; In re Victor L. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 902, 928.) We agree\nwith defendant that remand is appropriate.\nA.     Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518\n       At the time of defendant\u2019s original sentencing, trial courts had discretion under\nsection 1170 to select the appropriate term if a statute prescribed a sentencing triad.\n(\u00a7 1170, former subd. (b).) Pursuant to Senate Bill No. 567, effective January 1, 2022,\nsection 1170, subdivision (b)(1) now provides that \u201cthe court shall, in its sound\ndiscretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (2).\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b)(1); Stats. 2021, ch. 731, \u00a7 1.3.)\nThe referenced exception provides a term exceeding the middle term may be imposed\n\u201conly when there are circumstances in aggravation of the crime that justify the imposition\nof a term of imprisonment exceeding the middle term[,] and the facts underlying those\ncircumstances have been stipulated to by the defendant or have been found true beyond a\nreasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial.\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd.\n(b)(2).)\n       Assembly Bill No. 518, also effective January 1, 2022, modified section 654 to\ngive trial courts discretion to choose the count on which they would stay execution of\nsentence. (\u00a7 654, subd. (a); Stats. 2021, ch. 441, \u00a7 1.) \u201cThus, under newly amended\nsection 654, a trial court is no longer required to punish under the longest possible term\nof imprisonment when multiple offenses are based on the same act or omission.\n[Citation.] Section 654 \u2018now provides the trial court with discretion to impose and\nexecute the sentence of either term, which could result in the trial court imposing and\nexecuting the shorter sentence rather than the longer sentence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nWhite (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1229, 1236.)\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Although our remittitur directed the trial court to consider whether to exercise its\ndiscretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement under Senate Bill No. 620, the trial\ncourt is not precluded from considering an intervening change of law after the issuance of\nthe remittitur that \u201cwas not, and could not have been, addressed in our remand order, and\nso it was not within the scope of the remittitur.\u201d (People v. Hargis (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th\n199, 207.) Thus, Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518, both of which became\neffective after we issued our opinion, were applicable at resentencing. But the trial court\nheld the resentencing hearing \u201csolely to exercise\u201d its discretion under Senate Bill\nNo. 620. This was an abuse of discretion. (In re White (2020) 9 Cal.5th 455, 470.)\n       When a trial court is unaware of the scope of its discretion, remand for\nresentencing is required \u201cunless the record \u2018clearly indicate[s]\u2019 that the trial court would\nhave reached the same conclusion \u2018even if it had been aware that it had such\ndiscretion.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1391.) Our record contains\nno such clear indication. Instead, the trial court expressed concerns over the length of\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. Remand is therefore appropriate for the trial court to exercise its\ndiscretion under Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518.\n       We reject the People\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was simply too\negregious for the trial court to even remotely entertain staying the most serious\nconviction of murder in favor of imposing such minimal punishment for robbery.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the applicable law governing the defendant\u2019s sentence has substantively changed\nafter sentencing, it is almost always speculative for a reviewing court to say what the\nsentencing court would have done if it had known the scope of its discretionary powers at\nthe time of sentencing. Mere reliance on the length of the original sentence and attendant\ndecisions, such as imposing consecutive sentences, imposing middle or upper term\nsentences, or declining to strike enhancements, is not sufficient to provide a clear\nindication of what a sentencing court might do on remand if it had been fully aware of the\nscope of its discretionary powers.\u201d (People v. Salazar (2023) 15 Cal.5th 416, 431.)\n\n                                              7\n\f       Having concluded remand is appropriate, we need not consider the People\u2019s\ncontention that the trial court properly relied on the aggravating factors in the probation\nreport in selecting the upper term on the robbery count.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded for the trial court to consider\nexercising its discretion under Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518. The trial\ncourt should also consider any additional, applicable changes to sentencing laws. The\njudgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                   \/s\/\n                                                  MESIWALA, J.\n\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n \/s\/\nMAURO, Acting P.

The arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief filed by\nThe Appellate Law Firm involve matters unrelated to the order appealed\nfrom, egregious mischaracterizations of the family court\u2019s rulings, reliance on\ntrial evidence not in the record, and assertions unsupported by any legal\nauthority. We dismiss the appeal as frivolous and impose sanctions of\n$9,421.50 against The Appellate Law Firm.1\n\n         1 At oral argument, Weinert personally appeared and asked to\n\nsubstitute in as his own counsel of record. The court indicated that it did not\nintend to issue sanctions against Weinert based upon a frivolous appeal or\ndelay tactics, but against the law firm that filed the brief. Counsel from The\nAppellate Law Firm, former appellate counsel to Weinert, was permitted to\nand did address the propriety of sanctions as to the law firm. Weinert was\npermitted to and did address the merits of the appeal.\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                         MEMORANDUM OPINION2\n      Schuster filed a petition for legal and physical custody of Minor in\nDecember 2021. Schuster then filed a request for a DVRO. The DVRO\nrequest alleged, among other things, that Weinert was harassing Schuster on\nthe shared parenting application they used to communicate about Minor.\nThe family court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) against\nWeinert for no contact with Schuster except \u201cbrief and peaceful contact\u201d to\ncommunicate about Minor for court-ordered visits.\n      A three-day trial was held on the DVRO request and child custody in\nAugust 2022. The family court made an oral pronouncement at the\nconclusion of the trial, finding Weinert\u2019s behavior rose to the level of domestic\nviolence under the Domestic Violence Protection Act (DVPA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7\n6200 et seq.) and citing \u201cthe texts . . . especially with regard to the fact that\nMr. Weinert continually. . . commented in negative ways to Ms. Schuster\ndespite the testimony that there were repeated attempts asking Mr. Weinert\nto stop doing that.\u201d The court also found that Schuster \u201cdid testify credibly\u201d\nthat Weinert had sent her documents in violation of the TRO, which was\n\u201cprima facie evidence of harassment and the disturbing of the peace.\u201d It\ncontinued: \u201cWith the ruling on the DVRO, the Court does order, based on the\ndiscussed behaviors, that the best interest of [Minor], then, would be for\ncustody to be provided to [Schuster]\u201d with visitation to Weinert. A DVRO\nwas entered on August 29, 2022. It attached a custody and visitation order\ngranting legal and physical custody of Minor to Schuster.\n\n\n\n\n      2 We resolve this case by memorandum opinion under California\n\nStandards of Judicial Administration, section 8.1.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      Weinert appealed. Schuster filed a motion for attorney fees and\/or\nsanctions under California Rules of Court, rule 8.2763 against both Weinert\nand The Appellate Law Firm. The motion included a declaration from\nSchuster\u2019s counsel Edward Schrock that she had been billed $6,009.50 (at a\ndiscounted rate) for his preparation of the respondent\u2019s brief. It also included\na declaration from Schuster\u2019s other counsel, Richard Moller, that he had\nagreed to assist with the respondent\u2019s brief for $1,200. The motion requested\nattorney fees plus $412 in costs for filing the brief. We ordered that the\nmotion would be considered with the appeal and notified Weinert and The\nAppellate Law Firm that we were considering imposing sanctions. The\nAppellate Law Firm then filed an opposition to the motion, contending that\nthe arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief were not frivolous. The opposition did\nnot include any argument regarding the amount of fees or costs requested in\nthe motion.\n      \u201cCalifornia courts have the inherent power to dismiss frivolous appeals\u201d\nand \u201c \u2018[w]hen it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous\nor taken solely for delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as\nmay be just.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Gong & Kwong (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 510,\n516 (Gong); Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907.) Rule 8.276, subdivision (a)(1) provides\nthat we may impose sanctions on a party or attorney for \u201c[t]aking a frivolous\nappeal or appealing solely to cause delay.\u201d The first standard is objective: an\nappeal is objectively frivolous \u201cwhen a reasonable person would \u2018agree that\nthe appeal is completely devoid of merit.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Deal (2022) 80\nCal.App.5th 71, 79 (Deal).) The second standard is subjective, focused on the\nmotives and \u201cgood faith\u201d of appellant and counsel. (Gong, at p. 516.) \u201c \u2018While\n\n      3 Undesignated rule references are to the California Rules of Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\feach of the above standards provides independent authority for a sanctions\naward, in practice the two standards usually are used together \u201cwith one\nproviding evidence of the other. Thus, the total lack of merit of an appeal is\nviewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Ibid.) Sanctions \u201cshould be used sparingly to deter only the most egregious\nconduct,\u201d but they are imposed \u201c \u2018 \u201cto discourage further frivolous appeals,\nand to compensate for the loss that results from the delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (In re\nMarriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 651; Deal, at p. 79.)\n      All seven arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief show that the appeal here\nis objectively frivolous and intended to delay. First, the brief argues the\nfamily court \u201cabused its discretion in failing to enforce subpoenas,\u201d\nidentifying subpoenas purportedly issued to the parties\u2019 mediator Joseph\nHale, a car dealership, and a police officer. The record shows that at least\none of those subpoenas was unrelated to the trial on the DVRO: Weinert had\nfiled a subpoena for Hale to appear at an earlier proceeding on Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for an emergency temporary custody order. The brief offers nothing\nto show that the other two subpoenas were served, or that Weinert requested\nthe court take any action on these subpoenas (let alone that any failure to act\nwas an abuse of discretion).\n      Second, the brief argues that the family court erred in finding Weinert\nin contempt but fails to cite any such finding in the record. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(C) [matters must be supported by citation to record].) Schuster\nhad previously filed an order to show cause for contempt, but dismissed it\nbefore the trial on the DVRO. The brief appears to argue that the TRO (not\nthe DVRO) was \u201cpredicated\u201d on this contempt charge (the allegations, not any\nfinding by the court). Any information considered by the trial court prior to\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fissuance of the ex parte TRO is not before this court on appeal. Only the\nrestraining order after hearing dated August 29, 2022, was appealed.\n      Third, appellant\u2019s brief argues there was no substantial evidence to\nsupport a determination limiting Weinert\u2019s ability to manage Minor\u2019s medical\ncare. The brief does not address Family Code section 3044\u2019s rebuttable\npresumption that joint legal and physical custody is not in the best interests\nof a child following the decision to grant a request for a domestic violence\nrestraining order. Instead, the brief argues that the evidence did not support\na finding that Weinert \u201cmade [Minor\u2019s] doctor\u2019s appointments during\n[Schuster\u2019s] parenting time,\u201d and thus he should not have been deprived of\nparental rights over Minor\u2019s medical care. As a preliminary matter, the brief\nfails to cite the record showing the court relied on this evidence to find that\nproviding legal custody (including decisions on health care) to Schuster was\nin the Minor\u2019s best interests. Even if it did, the brief disputes this evidence\nby pointing to testimony from Minor\u2019s doctor that is not in the record. We\ncannot analyze a substantial evidence argument without an adequate record,\nincluding portions of the record that appellant has argued are relevant. (See,\ne.g., Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 181, 189\n[\u201cWithout a proper record, there is no way for this court to find that the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence\u201d].)4 The brief\nalso refers to documents Weinert presented on his earlier request for an\n\n\n\n      4 At oral argument, Weinert suggested the trial court failed to provide\n\nthe complete trial record and that this omission was intentional. Weinert\nbore the burden of ensuring an adequate record for review on appeal or\npursuing appropriate remedies if he believed the record was not provided in\nerror. (See, e.g., World Business Academy v. State Lands Commission (2018)\n24 Cal.App.5th 476, 492\u2013493.)\n\n\n                                        5\n\femergency temporary custody order, without any citation that this was\nevidence admitted in the DVRO trial.\n      Fourth, the brief argues there was no substantial evidence to support\nthe DVRO because Schuster \u201cmanipulated text messages that were presented\nto the trial court,\u201d but the trial exhibits\u2014including the voluminous text or\nFamily Wizard messages\u2014are not included in the record. Again, we cannot\nreach the merits of an argument without an adequate record of the evidence.\n(Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc., supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 186.)\n      Fifth, the brief argues Schuster made \u201cunfounded allegations of\nphysical incidents\u201d that did not support her earlier request for an emergency\ntemporary custody order. This is not an argument related to the DVRO, as\nthe brief appears to concede that Schuster did not raise these \u201cincidents\u201d\nafter previously alleging them.\n      Sixth, the brief argues that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion in\ndenying [Weinert\u2019s] request for a continuance in order to have a witness\ntestify.\u201d This is a gross mischaracterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nWeinert had an allotment of time to present evidence at the DVRO trial.\nTowards the end of that time, Weinert stated: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that I will\nhave enough time for [witness] to come down based upon being an hour. Is\nthere a possibility, your Honor, that I\u2019m able to get any more time?\u201d The\ncourt responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Appellant has provided no authority for any\nargument that the trial court abused its discretion in declining Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for additional time. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) [matters should be\nsupported by citation to legal authority where possible].)\n      Seventh, the brief includes an improper catch-all section that the\nfamily court made \u201cadditional blatant mistakes\u201d warranting reversal. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(B) [brief must state each point under a separate heading or\n\n                                        6\n\fsubheading summarizing the point].) It contends that Weinert was \u201cforced to\ntake pictures\u201d of trial evidence, because the family court \u201cwarned him that he\nwould not be allowed to see those records again.\u201d There is no citation to the\nrecord to support this assertion, but appears to be related to the parties\u2019\nstipulation to the return of the trial exhibits.\n      The brief then argues that the family court erred because it \u201conly\nallow[ed] the viewing of the videos [presented at trial by Weinert] silently,\nsignificantly weakening their impact and probative value.\u201d Weinert does not\ncite to any evidence in the trial record to support this argument. Indeed, the\nreporter\u2019s transcript shows that Weinert\u2019s videos were played but audio was\nnot reported.\n      Despite arguing that police call logs were improperly excluded from\ntrial\u2014citing only to a sustained objection that Weinert had to lay foundation\nbefore questioning Schuster about the logs\u2014the brief goes on to argue that\nany \u201cdocuments or reports\u201d from police or the mediator were \u201cimproperly\nadmitted.\u201d As there is no specific evidence identified, nor any citation to the\nrecord, we are unable to address the argument. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(C).)\n      In sum, all of the arguments presented in the appellant\u2019s brief involve\nmatters unrelated to the DVRO, egregious mischaracterizations of the court\u2019s\nrulings, arguments concerning documents in the court file not presented at\ntrial, arguments concerning trial evidence not in the appellate record, and\nassertions unsupported by any legal authority. Any reasonable attorney\nwould agree that the arguments as presented are completely without merit.5\n\n\n\n      5 At oral argument, Weinert raised additional arguments that were not\n\ncontained in the appellant\u2019s brief. These arguments are forfeited. (Palp, Inc.\nv. Williamsburg National Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 282, 291, fn. 2\n\n                                         7\n\f(Deal, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at p. 79.) The appeal is thus frivolous and\nwarrants sanctions. (Gong, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 516.) The tone of\nthe brief further supports this conclusion. \u201c[A]n unsupported appellate tirade\nis more than just words on paper; it represents a real cost to the opposing\nparty and to the state.\u201d (Pierotti v. Torian (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 32\u201333.)\n      At oral argument, the court clarified that sanctions would not be\nimposed against Weinert, but solely against the law firm that filed the\nchallenged brief. (See Rule 8.276 [appellate court may impose sanctions\nagainst party or attorney]; Malek Media Group, LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020)\n58 Cal.App.5th 817, 837 [same] (Malek); see also Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7128.5,\nsubd. (f)(1)(C) [\u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held\njointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and\nemployees\u201d].) \u201cSanctions are appropriate when appellant\u2019s counsel had a\nprofessional obligation not to pursue the appeal or should have declined the\ncase outright.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cSanctions against the party are appropriate when the\nrecord indicates the party benefitted from the delay or was otherwise\ninvolved in the bad faith conduct.\u201d (Ibid.)\n      We conclude that sanctions are appropriate against The Appellate Law\nFirm only. As explained above, the arguments in the firm\u2019s brief violate the\nRules of Court and are not supported by even a cursory reading of the record\npresented, let alone a \u201c \u2018careful reading of the record or the law.\u2019 \u201d (J.B.B.\nInvestment Partners Ltd. v. Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1, 17.) There is no\nevidence, however, that Weinert directly participated in this appeal: the\nnotice of appeal and appellant\u2019s brief were both filed by The Appellate Law\n\n\n[\u201c \u2018We do not consider arguments that are raised for the first time at oral\nargument\u2019 \u201d].)\n\n\n                                        8\n\fFirm. Nor is there any evidence that Weinert knew the arguments in the\nbrief were indisputably without merit, or that he benefitted from the delay.\n(Cf. Gong, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 519 [appellant benefited from\ncontinuing to delay satisfaction of monetary obligations].)\n      We impose $9,421.50 in sanctions to compensate Schuster for the loss\nresulting from this frivolous appeal. (Deal, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at p. 79.)\nFactors relevant to determining the amount of sanctions include \u201c \u2018the\namount of respondent\u2019s attorney fees on appeal; the amount of the judgment\nagainst appellant; the degree of objective frivolousness and delay; and the\nneed for discouragement of like conduct in the future.\u2019 \u201d (Gong, supra, 163\nCal.App.4th at p. 519.) Schuster\u2019s counsel filed declarations that $7,209.50\nwas incurred preparing the respondent\u2019s brief. We find this amount, plus the\n$412 filing fee and $1,800 for four hours of attorney time to prepare and\nattend oral argument (as requested by Moller at oral argument), appropriate.\nThis opinion constitutes a written statement of our reasons for imposing\nsanctions. (See In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 654.)\n                                DISPOSITION\n      The appeal is dismissed. Schuster is entitled to her costs on appeal.\n(Rule 8.278(a)(2).) The Appellate Law Firm is ordered to pay $9,421.50 in\nsanctions to Schuster for bringing this frivolous appeal. (Rule 8.276(a)(1).)\nThe clerk of this court and The Appellate Law Firm are each directed to\nforward a copy of this opinion to the State Bar of California upon issuance of\nthe remittitur. (Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6086.7, subd. (a)(3), 6068, subd. (o)(3).)\nThis opinion serves as notice to counsel that the matter of the sanctions\nimposed has been referred to the State Bar.

R. Civ. P. 9(b). Cheng did not plead facts\n\nleading to a strong inference that Kotick knew or deliberately disregarded the fact\n\nthat the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing1 and U.S. Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission investigations were nonroutine, significant,\n\nand likely to have material adverse outcomes. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A); Nguyen\n\nv.

Because Activision could only have\n\nscienter through Kotick, Cheng failed to adequately plead a strong inference of\n\nscienter against Activision. Prodanova v. H. C. Wainwright & Co., 993 F.3d 1097,\n\n1108 (9th Cir. 2021). Because Cheng\u2019s failure to adequately plead scienter\n\nconstitutes an independent basis to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the TAC,\n\nwe do not reach the adequacy of the pleading of falsity or of loss causation in the\n\n\n1\n    Now the California Civil Rights Department.\n\n                                          2\n\fTAC.

THOMAS, Circuit Judges.\n\n      JD Bols appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Mayor\n\nof San Diego (the Mayor) on his claims that the City of San Diego\u2019s moratorium\n\non the eviction of commercial tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic (the\n\nMoratorium) violated the Constitution\u2019s Takings Clause and Obligation of\n\nContracts Clause. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review de\n\nnovo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering the record in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d G & G Closed Cir. Events, LLC v.\n\nLiu, 45 F.4th 1113, 1115 (9th Cir. 2022). We affirm.\n\n      1. The Mayor argues that Bols lacks standing to sue under Article III of the\n\nConstitution because Bols likely could have evicted his tenants notwithstanding the\n\nMoratorium. Bols provided evidence, however, that he owns 99% of two LLCs\n\nthat lost roughly $60,000 in rent during the pandemic. Additionally, Bols stated\n\nduring his deposition that some of his tenants could not pay rent due to the\n\n\n\n      **\n            The Honorable Danny J. Boggs, United States Circuit Judge for the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         2\n\fpandemic, and that he believed that he could not evict them due to the Moratorium.\n\nUnder our decision in Iten v. Los Angeles, 81 F.4th 979, 992 (9th Cir. 2023), these\n\nallegations are sufficient to establish Bols\u2019s Article III standing.1\n\n      2. The Mayor claims that he has legislative immunity from Bols\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe Mayor, however, was sued only in his official capacity. \u201c[A]n official-capacity\n\nsuit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\u201d\n\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985). \u201c[P]ersonal immunity defenses\u201d\u2014\n\nsuch as absolute legislative immunity\u2014are therefore \u201cunavailable\u201d in \u201can official-\n\ncapacity action . . . .\u201d Id. at 166\u201367; see also Schmidt v. Contra Costa County, 693\n\nF.3d 1122, 1131 n.10 (9th Cir. 2012).\n\n      3. The Mayor argues that Bols\u2019s claim under the Obligation of Contracts\n\nClause is moot. Bols\u2019s requests for declaratory relief and injunctive relief were\n\nmooted by the expiration of the Moratorium. See Brach v. Newsom, 38 F.4th 6, 11\n\n(9th Cir. 2022) (finding that claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against\n\nCalifornia\u2019s pandemic-related school-closure order were mooted by the expiration\n\nof the order). And Bols has not requested monetary damages in connection with his\n\nObligation of Contracts claim. His claim under the Obligation of Contracts Clause\n\n\n1\n  The Mayor also argues that Bols lacks prudential standing under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 17 because his LLCs are the real parties in interest. We need not\nreach this issue, however, because Bols\u2019s claims fail on the merits for the reasons\ngiven below. G & G Closed Cir. Events, LLC, 45 F.4th at 1117 (we may \u201caffirm\nthe district court on any grounds the record supports\u201d).\n\n                                            3\n\fis therefore moot.\n\n      4. Bols argues that the Moratorium constitutes a per se physical taking under\n\nCedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 141 S. Ct. 2063 (2021). But the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nholding there is not as broad as Bols suggests. In Cedar Point Nursery, the Court\n\nheld only that \u201cgovernment-authorized invasions of property . . . are physical\n\ntakings requiring just compensation.\u201d Id. at 2074 (emphasis added). The\n\nMoratorium does not constitute an \u201cinvasion\u201d of property because it does not\n\nrequire commercial lessees to accommodate tenants other than those that they\n\nalready voluntarily invited. Cf. id. at 2072. This case therefore bears more\n\nsimilarity to Yee v. City of Escondido, in which the Supreme Court held that a\n\nCalifornia rent-control ordinance applicable to mobile homes did not constitute a\n\nphysical taking.2 503 U.S. 519, 526\u201332 (1992). Here, as in Yee, the government did\n\nnot \u201crequire[] any physical invasion of . . . property,\u201d because the \u201ctenants were\n\ninvited by [the owners], not forced upon them by the government.\u201d Id. at 528. And\n\nany restriction on a landlord\u2019s ability to evict tenants was temporary. Id.\n\n(explaining that the owners retained the ability to evict tenants, \u201calbeit with 6 or 12\n\n\n\n2\n  At oral argument, Bols\u2019s counsel asserted that the Moratorium also constituted a\nregulatory taking. Bols forfeited this argument, however, by failing to raise it in his\nbriefs. See Sabra v. Maricopa Cnty. Comm. Coll. Dist., 44 F.4th 867, 881 n.5 (9th\nCir. 2022). Even were we to reach this argument, the factors set forth in Penn\nCentral Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), would not\nsupport such a conclusion.\n\n                                           4\n\fmonths notice,\u201d if they wished to \u201cchange the use of [their] land\u201d).\n\n      Bols also cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alabama Ass\u2019n of Realtors\n\nv. Department of Health and Human Services, which invalidated the Centers for\n\nDisease Control\u2019s (CDC) eviction moratorium, for the proposition that eviction\n\nmoratoria intrude on \u201cthe right to exclude.\u201d 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (per\n\ncuriam). But the Supreme Court did not hold that any intrusion on the right to\n\nexclude constituted a taking. Id. On the contrary, the Court reserved judgment on\n\nthe constitutionality of the CDC\u2019s moratorium, invalidating it only because it\n\nexceeded the CDC\u2019s statutory authority. Id. at 2486. That decision therefore has no\n\napplication here.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f","                                                                              FILED\n                             NOT FOR PUBLICATION\n                                                                               JAN 19 2024\n                    UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS                        MOLLY C.

We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.\n\n      1.     The government points out that the BIA erroneously relied on\n\nstatutory provisions governing removal proceedings instead of those governing\n\ndeportation proceedings, which do not contain \u201ctime or numeric limits on motions\n\nto reopen.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D) addresses exceptions to filing\n\ndeadlines regarding orders entered in absentia in deportation proceedings, and it\n\nprovides that the time and numerical limitations shall not apply to a motion to\n\nreopen based on failure to receive notice.\n\n      The Board thus committed legal error and abused its discretion in\n\nconcluding that Petitioner\u2019s motion was \u201cboth time- and number-barred.\u201d See\n\nSingh v. Holder, 771 F.3d 647, 653 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that the BIA erred, and\n\nthus abused its discretion, when it denied a motion to reopen for lack of authority).\n\n      Nonetheless, the Board\u2019s error was harmless because substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Board\u2019s finding that Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of\n\neffective notice.

The Board reasoned that it already had rejected\n\nPetitioner\u2019s argument\u2014 that she failed to receive notice of the hearing\u2014twice.\n\nThe Board\u2019s finding in its two earlier denials of Petitioner\u2019s motion to\n\nreopen\u2014that Petitioner\u2019s evidence did not establish that she failed to receive notice\n\nbecause the envelope that she submitted with the incorrect address was postmarked\n\nJune 9, 1997, after the September 23, 1996 hearing\u2014is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      Petitioner is correct that the record establishes that she did not receive actual\n\nnotice of the hearing. Even though the envelope containing the notice informing\n\nher of the September 1996 hearing was sent to the correct address, the envelope\n\nwas stamped as unclaimed and returned to sender. This court has held \u2018that notice\n\nby certified mail sent to an alien\u2019s last known address can be sufficient under the\n\n[Immigration and Nationality] Act, even if no one signed for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMejia-Hernandez v.

We decline to reach her\n\n\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d argument because she did not present that argument to\n\nthe BIA in her second motion to reopen. See Umana-Escobar v.

FLETCHER, NGUYEN, and R.

We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. MacIntyre v.\n\nCarroll Coll., 48 F.4th 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2022). We have jurisdiction under 28\n\n\n\n      *\n             This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\fU.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n\n      1. To begin, we reject Hwang\u2019s argument that he pleaded a claim of\n\nconstructive discharge. While Hwang alleges with specificity the working\n\nconditions he believed were intolerable, the choice he believed was coercive, and\n\nthe reason he felt compelled to retire, each of which could support a claim for\n\nconstructive discharge, he does not take the necessary next step and raise a\n\nconstructive-discharge claim. We decline Hwang\u2019s invitation to find that\n\nreferences to a constructive discharge claim in case management filings could fix\n\nthe absence of such a claim in the complaint.\n\n      2. But even if Hwang had pleaded a constructive discharge claim, the district\n\ncourt properly granted summary judgment for NTESS. \u201cSummary judgment is\n\nproper if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is clearly\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Munoz v. Mabus, 630 F.3d 856, 860 (9th\n\nCir. 2010). On appeal, Hwang alleges that he was constructively discharged under\n\ntwo theories: intolerable working conditions and coercion. Both fail.\n\n      First, to establish constructive discharge due to intolerable working\n\nconditions, an employee must show the employer intentionally permitted working\n\nconditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would\n\nhave been compelled to resign. Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 555 (2016)\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f(federal law); Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1248-49 (1994)\n\n(state law). The working conditions must be so \u201csevere\u201d as to compel a reasonable\n\nemployee to resign. See Green, 578 U.S. at 558; accord Cloud v. Casey, 76 Cal.\n\nApp. 4th 895, 902 (1999) (\u201cintolerable or aggravated\u201d).\n\n      Here, the evidence is not enough to create a genuine issue of material fact\n\nthat intolerable working conditions existed. Hwang argues that by December of\n\n2019, working conditions at NTESS had become intolerable. This claim is belied\n\nby his attempt to rescind his decision to retire. But even if it were not, Hwang\u2019s\n\narguments are insufficient. Hwang tries to \u201cweave unrelated and disjointed events\n\ntogether\u201d into a pattern, but he does not show a \u201ccontinuous pattern\u201d of\n\naggravating conditions or discriminatory conduct. Turner, 7 Cal. 4th at 1255.\n\nWhile he alleges that he faced discrimination including a racist comment, criticism\n\nof his posture and demeanor, and false accusations of missing meetings, these\n\nfacts, even if true, are not enough to establish constructive discharge. See, e.g.,\n\nBrooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 930 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding no\n\nconstructive discharge after a woman quit her job when, after complaining of\n\nsexual harassment, she received low performance ratings, was scheduled for bad\n\nshifts, and had to work at the same time as the alleged perpetrator). Hwang also\n\ncomplains that he was the only manager forced to work with a coach, he received a\n\npoor \u201cBlock 9\u201d performance rating, and he was put on a Performance Expectation\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fPlan (PEP). But Hwang disputes neither that he received complaints about his\n\nbehavior and management style in 2016 and 2019, nor that performance issues\n\nwere raised with him in his year-end evaluations.\n\n      Second, under a coercion theory of constructive discharge, an employee\n\nmust show that a reasonable person under the same circumstances would feel\n\ncompelled to retire. Knappenberger v. City of Phoenix, 566 F.3d 936, 941-42 (9th\n\nCir. 2009). We consider \u201cwhether the employee was given an alternative to\n\nresignation or retirement, understood the choice, had a reasonable time in which to\n\ndecide, or could select the timing.\u201d Id. at 941.\n\n      Here, Hwang argues that giving him only 24 hours to decide between\n\nworking on a PEP plan, resigning, or appealing the decision was coercive,\n\nparticularly because he could not get a timely answer on whether he would lose his\n\nbenefits if he chose to contest his termination and was ultimately terminated. But\n\nHwang opted to retire and even chose his retirement date, setting it for after he\n\nused his vacation days. Although we view the 24-hour time frame given to Hwang\n\nas potentially problematic, it is nevertheless not sufficient to show that Hwang did\n\nnot have a real choice. See Knappenberger, 566 F.3d at 941-42 (a choice between\n\n\u201cunpleasant alternatives \u2026 does not of itself establish that a resignation was\n\ninduced by duress or coercion\u201d (citations omitted)). In Knappenberger, for\n\nexample, we considered a constructive discharge claim of an employee who chose\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fto retire after being given the choice to either retire early (and keep his lifetime\n\nhealth insurance) or be fired (and lose it). Id. at 939-42. We held that the employee\n\ndid not establish that he was coerced or deprived of his free will, even though he\n\nfelt he needed insurance because his wife had a history of breast cancer. Id. If\n\nthose facts failed to show coercion, so do the facts here. Hwang was not forced to\n\nchoose between retirement and termination, even though he alleges that he felt\n\ntermination was inevitable.\n\n      3. Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nHwang\u2019s retaliation claim under Title VII and California\u2019s Fair Employment and\n\nHousing Act (FEHA). Hwang argues that NTESS retaliated against him by\n\nrefusing to accept his rescission of retirement. Hwang\u2019s decision to retire was\n\naccepted by NTESS the same day. NTESS\u2019s refusal to accept Hwang\u2019s attempt to\n\nrescind his retirement a month later was not an adverse action that \u201cmaterially\n\naffect[ed] the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of [his] employment.\u201d\n\nChuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1126 (9th Cir.\n\n2000). Other courts have held that the \u201cfailure to accept the employee\u2019s rescission\n\nof [his] voluntary resignation is not an adverse employment action.\u201d Featherstone\n\nv. S. California Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1163-64 (2017)\n\n(citation omitted) (collecting cases). We agree.\n\n      This evidence is also not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\ffor retaliation under Title VII, which would require Hwang to establish that\n\nNTESS\u2019s refusal to accept his retirement rescission would deter a reasonable\n\nperson from reporting discrimination.

See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\f      Jones contends that the district court erred by failing to (1) calculate the\n\nGuidelines range on the record; (2) consider his arguments or the 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; and (3) explain the sentence adequately. We review\n\nfor plain error, see United States v. Valencia-Barragan, 608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th\n\nCir. 2010), and conclude that there is none. The record reflects that probation\n\ncalculated the undisputed 7-13 month Guidelines range and recommended a 3-\n\nmonth sentence and 21-month term of supervision, both to sanction Jones for his\n\nbreach of the court\u2019s trust and to permit him another opportunity to address his\n\nsubstance use issues. The record further reflects that, after reviewing probation\u2019s\n\nmemorandum and hearing argument from Jones and the government, the court\n\nadopted probation\u2019s recommendation and imposed the significantly below-\n\nGuidelines sentence. On this record, and in light of the district court\u2019s familiarity\n\nwith Jones\u2019s history during his previous term of supervision, Jones has not shown a\n\nreasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence in the\n\nabsence of the alleged errors.

Baldwin then\n   moved to reopen the case, asserting that Judge Pitman and the district court\n   judge who had ruled on her action were biased against her. The district court\n   denied the motion to reopen, again concluding that Baldwin\u2019s attempts to\n   challenge the validity of prior rulings should have been through direct appeals\n   in those cases. Baldwin has now filed a motion for authorization to proceed\n   in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, which constitutes a challenge to the\n   district court\u2019s certification that any appeal would not be taken in good faith\n   because Baldwin will not present a nonfrivolous appellate issue. See Baugh v.\n   Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).\n          Before this court, Baldwin repeats her assertions that Judge Pitman\u2019s\n   prior rulings were wrong and evinced bias against her and that she is entitled\n   to reconsideration of those decisions. She also maintains that the district\n   court should not have entered the vexatious litigant order in an earlier action.\n   Baldwin has not shown that the district court erred in ruling that any\n   challenges to those earlier rulings should have been presented in appeals from\n   those cases, rather than through new lawsuits. See Alvestad v. Monsanto Co.,\n   671 F.2d 908, 912 (5th Cir. 1982) (noting we review such decisions under an\n   abuse of discretion standard). In addition, she has not shown that her\n   assertions of bias against the district judge who ruled in those cases could not\n   have been raised and appealed in those proceedings. See Liteky v. United\n   States, 510 U.S. 540, 543-56 (1994). Thus, Baldwin has not established that\n   her proposed claims were nonfrivolous or that the district court erred in\n   denying her leave to file the complaint.\n          The appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. See Howard\n   v. King, 707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983). Accordingly, Baldwin\u2019s motion\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCase: 23-50349       Document: 00517037889           Page: 3   Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 23-50349\n\n\n   to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. See\n   id.; Baugh, 117 F.3d at 202 & n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Baldwin\u2019s motion to\n   reinstate a dissent order is DENIED.\n          The instant case is Baldwin\u2019s eighth attempt in federal court to\n   challenge the denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising from injuries\n   she suffered in 2006 and 2007. The district court has barred Baldwin from\n   filing further actions without obtaining consent from a federal district or\n   magistrate judge. In addition, this court has previously barred Baldwin from\n   filing further pleadings in an unsuccessful appeal. Despite these limits,\n   Baldwin continues to file frivolous pleadings. Accordingly, Baldwin is\n   WARNED that any further attempts to challenge the denial of benefits\n   arising from her injuries in 2006 and 2007, against any party, will invite the\n   imposition of sanctions. See Coghlan v. Starkey, 852 F.2d 806, 817 n.21 (5th\n   Cir. 1988) (holding that this court has the inherent power to sanction litigants\n   for frivolous or repetitive filings).\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f","      [Cite as In re B.M., 2024-Ohio-111.]\n\n\n\n\n                          IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\n                              SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n                                  WILLIAMS COUNTY\n\nIn re B.M., M.M.

(\u201cthe children\u201d), and granting permanent custody of the children to appellee,\n\nWilliams County Job and Family Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d). For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe affirm the judgment.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} Mother sets forth three assignments of error:\n\n             1. The trial court abused its discretion in denying A.H. and K.M.\u2019s\n\n      joint motion to dismiss based on the passage of time.\n\n             2. The trial court committed plain error by not dismissing the case as\n\n      to [the children] for the GAL\u2019s [(Guardian Ad Litem)] failure to perform\n\n      his duties, to the prejudice of A.H.\n\n             3. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and finding\n\n      that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\n      convincing evidence.\n\n      {\u00b6 3} Father sets forth one assignment of error:\n\n             1. The trial court errored [sic] when it granted the motion for\n\n      permanent custody [sic] because the original complaint had been filed more\n\n      than two years prior.\n\n                                      Background\n\n      {\u00b6 4} Mother has four biological children: S.O., born in or about 2008; X.H., born\n\nin 2010; M.M., born in November 2018; and B.M., born in April 2020. S.O. and X.H.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fwere fathered by men other than K.M., and are not involved in this appeal. However,\n\nS.O. and X.H. will be mentioned when pertinent and significant to this appeal.\n\n         {\u00b6 5} The agency\u2019s involvement with mother, father and the children spanned\n\nthree years, 2020 through 2023, during which time four cases were filed and numerous\n\ncourt hearings were held. What occurred at these hearings is helpful to understanding the\n\nprogression of the cases, thus, the relevant events are summarized below.\n\n2020\n\n         {\u00b6 6} On April 29, 2020, the agency became involved with the family when\n\nmother tested positive for oxycodone (\u201coxy\u201d), methamphetamine (\u201cmeth\u201d) and\n\namphetamine (\u201camphet\u201d)1 at the time of B.M.\u2019s premature birth. Mother denied drug\n\nuse. In May 2020, mother tested positive for meth, and again denied drug use. Safety\n\nplans were established by the agency for the benefit of all four of mother\u2019s children.\n\n         {\u00b6 7} On July 13, 2020, complaints were filed which alleged the children were\n\ndependent and neglected; father\u2019s overdose in December 2019 was mentioned.\n\n         {\u00b6 8} The agency established case plans for mother and father, which were\n\nagreeable to the parents. Mother\u2019s case plan required her to: maintain housing and\n\nemployment; complete PRC2 applications, parenting classes and the Family Intervention\n\n\n\n1\n    Meth is converted by the body into amphet.\n2\n PRC paid for visitations, parenting classes and other services. Without a completed\napplication, the parent had to self-pay for the services.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fCourt program (\u201cFIC\u201d); comply with home visits and drug screens; and undergo\n\nsubstance use and mental health treatment. Father\u2019s case plan was the same, but FIC was\n\nnot included.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On August 12, 2020, GAL Aaron Cook filed a report concerning the family\n\nmembers. Also on the day, the children were adjudicated neglected and dependent, and\n\nthe agency was granted protective supervision of the children.\n\n2021\n\n                    Semi-Annual Review Hearing - January 5, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Mother attended the hearing and consented to the agency\u2019s continued\n\nprotective supervision of the children. Father did not attend the hearing.\n\n                  Annual Review Hearing\/GAL Report - July 1, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 11} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother attended the hearing via Zoom, father did not attend. In April\n\n2021, mother had a random drug screen and was positive for meth, she failed to show for\n\nan appointment at Recovery Services (\u201cRecovery\u201d), and cancelled an appointment.\n\nMother then started inpatient treatment at Serenity Haven (\u201cSerenity\u201d); she was sober and\n\ntaking parenting classes. Her 68-year-old grandfather, T.V. (the children\u2019s great-\n\ngrandfather), took in all four of mother\u2019s children while she was in inpatient treatment.\n\nMother had two visits with the children, but visits stopped due to a verbal altercation and\n\nbecause the children had severe head lice.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\f       {\u00b6 13} In May and June 2021, father had three random drug screens and tested\n\npositive for, respectively: THC; cocaine, meth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet and\n\nTHC. The court suspended father\u2019s visits with the children due to his failure to comply\n\nwith the case plan. Protective supervision of the children was continued.\n\n                                   Show Cause - Father\n\n       {\u00b6 14} On August 12, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging father\n\nfailed to follow the court\u2019s orders; a hearing on the motion was scheduled for September\n\n8, 2021. However, father emailed the caseworker that he could not attend the hearing\n\nbecause his 20-year-old daughter died and the funeral was in Kentucky on September 8,\n\n2021. The court rescheduled the hearing, and ordered father to provide written\n\nverification of his daughter\u2019s death and funeral.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The show cause hearing was for rescheduled September 15, 2021, but\n\nfather failed to appear and there was no communication with him since his email. The\n\ncourt issued a bench warrant for father; he was arrested.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} On September 22, 2021, a bond hearing was held, with father present, and a\n\n$5,000 bond was requested to ensure father\u2019s appearance at a future hearing. Father told\n\nthe court that he lived in a trailer (\u201cthe trailer\u201d) and \u201ccame back up here to help [mother]\n\nget her place fixed up. We was working things out, I\u2019ve been there all year. That\u2019s my\n\nphysical address.\u201d Father claimed he had no money for bond, as all of his money was\n\nwrapped up in the trailer. The judge ordered $5,000 bond, no 10%.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       {\u00b6 17} On September 28, 2021, the show cause hearing was held, and father\n\nadmitted he violated the court\u2019s orders. The court accepted father\u2019s admissions, released\n\nhim from custody and scheduled a sentencing date.\n\n                          Review Hearing - October 21, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 18} The 15-month review hearing was held; mother was present, father was\n\nnot, as his attorney indicated that father was working and could not miss work. It was\n\nrequested that protective custody be extended. Mother claimed she was not in\n\nrelationship with father and continued to work her case plan, but she had a positive drug\n\nscreen in September 2021. Father tested positive for THC in early October 2021, and he\n\ntested positive for a relatively high level of meth, amphet and THC in mid-October 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} GAL Cook testified and voiced numerous concerns. First, T.V. spent less\n\ntime with mother\u2019s four children, so mother stepped in to help. The two older children\n\nwere criminally charged for property damage, and school was not great. Next, despite\n\ncourt orders that father have only supervised visits, when he was in jail the video footage\n\nrevealed that he asked mother to allow him to see the children and she complied. The\n\nGAL viewed another video in which mother said to father that the court expected her to\n\nbreak up with him, but she had no intention of doing so; she would just tell the court what\n\nit wanted to hear. The GAL questioned how much progress the parents made in the last\n\n15 months, and thought future options should be explored, as the parents seemed intent\n\non deceiving the court and not working the process.\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\f         {\u00b6 20} The court temporarily extended protective custody; a full hearing was\n\nscheduled to determine whether to continue protective custody beyond the one-year\n\nmark.\n\n     GAL Report\/Motion to Extend Protective Custody Hearing - November 12, 2021\n\n         {\u00b6 21} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family members.\n\n         {\u00b6 22} Mother and father attended the hearing. Mother completed inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, outpatient treatment at Recovery and was in aftercare sessions.\n\nOverall, she made significant progress in her case plan services, yet she was unemployed,\n\nreceived disability payments, had not secured her own housing and had only T.V. for\n\nsupport.\n\n         {\u00b6 23} Father completed an assessment at Recovery and it was initially\n\nrecommended that he attend individual counseling, submit to random drug screens and go\n\nto medication management services. However, due to father\u2019s positive drug screens,\n\nintensive outpatient group sessions were suggested. Father was drug tested by the agency\n\ntwice a month, and all screens were positive for illegal drugs. It was reported that\n\nbetween July and October 2021, father refused some drug screens and threatened agency\n\nworkers, so no meetings were attempted with him due to safety concerns. Father\u2019s\n\nbehavior improved, he was civil and he apologized for his actions.\n\n         {\u00b6 24} In late October 2021, father suffered a serious leg injury. He disclosed that\n\nhe received social security disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) and worked construction on the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fside; he did not verify his work. Father lived at the trailer, owned by the trailer park, and\n\npaid lot rent and utilities. Since April 2021, he made improvements on the trailer. He\n\nslowly worked on his case plan and made some progress.\n\n        {\u00b6 25} The court granted the agency\u2019s motion to extend protective supervision.\n\n        Sanction Hearing for Father\u2019s Contempt Citation - November 23, 2021\n\n        {\u00b6 26} Father provided the court with the obituary for his 22-year-old step-\n\ndaughter, who died in Kentucky on August 20, 2021. Father attended the viewing on or\n\nabout August 24, 2021, but not the funeral, and he returned to Ohio on September 1,\n\n2021.\n\n        {\u00b6 27} The agency indicated that father was cooperative, signed a release of\n\ninformation and allowed four home visits; the trailer was clean and father claimed that\n\nonly he will live there. He attended one individual treatment session at Recovery, on\n\nNovember 1, 2021, did not attend two later sessions and failed to participate in intensive\n\ngroup sessions. He claimed he completed a TeleMed mental health assessment in\n\nNovember 2021. Father\u2019s two drug tests by Recovery were positive for, respectively:\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet, THC, THC3 and hydromorphone (for which\n\nfather had a prescription), and his two drug screens by the agency, conducted on different\n\ndates than Recovery\u2019s tests, were both positive for meth, amphet and THC. Father was\n\nunable to visit the children due to his leg injury.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f        {\u00b6 28} The agency recommended, as a sanction for the contempt citation, that\n\nfather attend the Renewal Center (\u201cRenewal\u201d) and complete any recommended treatment;\n\nno jail time was recommended if successfully completed Renewal.\n\n        {\u00b6 29} The court sentenced father to 30 days in jail, which were suspended if he\n\nsuccessfully completed Renewal or any other inpatient rehab and complied with all\n\noutpatient orders and recommendations.\n\n                                  Show Cause - Mother\n\n        {\u00b6 30} On December 28, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging\n\nmother failed to follow the court\u2019s orders. On December 30, 2021, a motion hearing was\n\nheld, with mother present. It was reported that on December 8, 2021, mother was drug\n\nscreened by Recovery and tested positive for Gabapentin, which she was prescribed, but\n\n\u201cit came back at a high level,\u201d and she was also screened by FIC, and tested positive for\n\nmeth. On December 10, 2021, she was drug screened by Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth. Mother was drug tested by the agency in November and December 2021, on\n\ndifferent days than Recovery and FIC, and all tests were negative.\n\n        {\u00b6 31} The positive drug tests were discussed with mother; she did not admit to\n\ndrug use. Recovery recommended intensive outpatient treatment, while FIC\n\nrecommended inpatient treatment at Serenity, where she would be admitted on January 4,\n\n2022.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 32} The court found mother in contempt by violating her case plan when she,\n\ninter alia, tested positive for illegal drugs. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, to be\n\nserved immediately unless she purged the contempt by completing a refresher course at\n\nSerenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The court granted emergency custody of all four of mother\u2019s children to the\n\nagency. The four children were removed from the home and placed in foster homes.\n\n2022\n\n                        Motion for Reconsideration and Hearing\n\n       {\u00b6 34} On January 5, 2022, mother filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ncourt\u2019s findings that she violated the court\u2019s orders by using illegal drugs, not being\n\ntruthful or cooperative, and continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} On January 10, 2022, a hearing was held and mother presented evidence\n\nthat on January 3, 2022, she took a hair follicle test and no drugs were detected. She\n\ntestified, and presented the testimony of the worker who collected her hair sample, sent it\n\nout for testing and received the test results. The agency offered the testimony of a\n\nforensic toxicologist, who studied the effects of drugs on the body and worked in a\n\nlaboratory which specialized in detecting drugs in biological fluids.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The court found the science clearly showed there was meth in mother\u2019s\n\ndrug screen, which was a violation of the court\u2019s order. The court found nothing to\n\noverturn its previous findings, and denied mother\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f      Hearing on Temporary Custody and Motion for Sanctions - January 31, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 37} Mother and father were present at the hearing and both consented to the\n\nagency\u2019s request for temporary custody of the children. Father then asked to be removed\n\nfrom the case plan, which the court permitted; the agency withdrew its motion for\n\nsanctions.\n\n        {\u00b6 38} The court granted temporary custody of the children to the agency.\n\n                             Review Hearing - March 9, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 39} Mother attended the hearing, father did not. It was reported that father\n\nwanted to be on back on the case plan again; he was added back. Mother was in inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, she was compliant and had an expected out-date of April 5, 2022.\n\nIt was not known where mother would live when released, as the agency conducted a\n\nhome study of T.V., and while he passed his background check and his home was\n\napproved, he had four positive screens for THC so more random drug tests were sought.\n\nMother visited with the children, and there were no concerns. The children did well in\n\ntheir foster home, although M.M. struggled and cried a lot at first due to her attachment\n\nissues with mother.\n\n        {\u00b6 40} The court found it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain in their\n\ncurrent placement, and for the agency to have temporary custody. Father\u2019s 30-day jail\n\nsentence was reimposed, but suspended if he successfully completed inpatient drug\n\ntreatment.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f                   GAL Reports - June 27, 2022, July 1 and 24, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 41} GAL Cook filed reports with updates as to each family member.\n\n                       Semi-Annual Review Hearing - July 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Bother parents attended the hearing. Also before the court was a motion to\n\ndetermine the status of father\u2019s case plan, as he was added back to the plan on March 10,\n\n2022, but then said he did not want to be on the case plan. Father\u2019s counsel indicated\n\nfather wanted to be on the case plan and father was willing to sign the plan that day.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Father completed no case plan goals, and his last drug screen for the\n\nagency on May 4, 2022, was positive for THC and fentanyl. The caseworker attempted\n\nto visit or meet with father 11 times, but father did not answer the door or he was a no-\n\nshow. He visited the children every other week, which went well. Father showed the\n\nchildren a picture of a puppy, and said he and mother bought the puppy.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Mother lived with T.V., whose home was approved for the children.\n\nMother did not work; she received SSDI. She visited the children every other week for\n\ntwo hours, and the visits went very well.\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Mother had a positive drug screen for meth on June 27, 2022, and went\n\nback into Recovery\u2019s IOP (intensive outpatient program), which she attended once a\n\nweek. It was recommended by Recovery that mother go for inpatient treatment; she did\n\nnot comply. Mother was unsuccessfully released from FIC, which was considered a case\n\nplan fail.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 46} The agency was concerned that parents were in a relationship, despite\n\nmother\u2019s claims to the contrary. The parents were seen together many times, including in\n\nApril 2022, when the caseworker saw them together at Wal-Mart, and in June 2022,\n\nwhen the worker saw them in a car together. The worker addressed the June sighting\n\nwith mother, but she claimed they were not together and she had been at home all day.\n\nMother also said father was friends with T.V., and went to T.V.\u2019s home for visits. The\n\nagency made it clear that if the parents were in a relationship, they were judged as a\n\nwhole, so father\u2019s illegal drug use and noncompliance with the case plan reflected on\n\nmother. The agency did not believe mother and father were honest.\n\n       {\u00b6 47} The children were doing very well in their foster placement, their medical\n\nneeds were met, and there were no concerns with them remaining in the foster home.\n\n       {\u00b6 48} Mother testified she went to Wal-Mart with father a couple of weeks after\n\nshe was released from Serenity because she did not have a car; she was released on April\n\n5, 2022. She claimed she did not get a puppy with father; he bought a puppy for the\n\nchildren and the puppy was with mother at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 49} Mother was aware of the recommendation for inpatient treatment at\n\nSerenity, but said she was told if she \u201ccontinued to do what I need to do, sign a behavior\n\ncontract and another piece of paper stating that I will be clean, and do whatever the paper\n\nstates then I should be okay with * * * continuing with IOP.\u201d She did not want to go the\n\nSerenity because \u201cthey\u2019re not very confidential with their information for their clients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\f      {\u00b6 50} Regarding mother\u2019s positive screen for meth on June 27, 2022, she said,\n\n\u201cactually, I wouldn\u2019t have graduated IOP if my cup would have come back positive. My\n\ncup come back negative. * * * [M]y sister and I have been arguing quite often. She went\n\non and told people that she knew that I\u2019m not going to get my kids back, she don\u2019t want\n\nme to have my kids back and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes for me not to get my kids back.\u201d\n\nWhen mother was asked how that translated to a positive screen for meth, she replied,\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on the partying kick and I\u2019m not because I want my kids and I told her that.\n\nI honestly think she did something to my drink.\u201d Mother was questioned about the\n\nspecific circumstances when she was with her sister, and she said,\n\n             It would have been like a Friday or Saturday. Then I found out the\n\n      previous week after me hanging out with her that she was going around\n\n      asking people if she knew me, or if they knew and they were like well I\n\n      know of her, why? And she went about saying well I heard she\u2019s not going\n\n      to get her kids back and she don\u2019t deserve them back, she don\u2019t you know I\n\n      don\u2019t talk to my sister on that kind of level. I don\u2019t want her knowing none\n\n      of my business, I don\u2019t want nobody knowing none of my business unless it\n\n      comes from my mouth.\n\n      {\u00b6 51} When mother was asked if she knew that drugging someone\u2019s drink was a\n\ncrime, she said she knew now, but would not file a police report because \u201cshe\u2019s trying to\n\nget herself out of her situation. I\u2019m not cool with that.\u201d Mother denied using drugs.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\f       {\u00b6 52} Mother was also questioned about her positive drug screen prior to June\n\n2022; she again denied drug use. She could not remember the background of that\n\nprevious screen.\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Father testified, and was asked if he would go to the recommended\n\ninpatient treatment, to which he replied, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do, I mean just everything\u2019s got\n\nmy mind boggled. I mean.\u201d When asked if that was a yes or no, he said, \u201cYes, most\n\ndefinitely, I mean but.\u201d He claimed he was in inpatient treatment for two days, and\n\n\u201cwent from there to the hospital after that because I needed medical attention and well the\n\nRenewed Minds down here in town put me on medication, Suboxone, and that just\n\ndestroyed me.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 54} Father was questioned about overdosing on December 11, 2019, and said,\n\n\u201cI did not overdose.\u201d When asked if he remembered getting Narcan by EMS, he said,\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of why, well okay, now I\u2019m epileptic. I\u2019ve been on medication for that all\n\nmy life, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, stuff like that. And uh, but there were no positive\n\nscreens for anything like that.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 55} Father was asked about testing positive for fentanyl and he said he took the\n\ndrug test the day after he got out of the hospital where he was given painkillers for his\n\nknee, which he claimed almost had to be amputated. He was asked if he was on\n\npainkillers still, and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking no pain killers or nothing like that.\u201d He\n\nwas then asked when he stopped taking prescribed painkillers and he said, \u201cAs soon as I\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\fgot out of the hospital. * * * So it was like November or December. * * * That was like\n\nPercocet that was when I got out of the hospital.\u201d Father admitted marijuana use.\n\n       {\u00b6 56} The court ordered mother and father to submit to a drug test \u201cright now\n\nwhile we\u2019re here,\u201d then report back to court. Mother\u2019s drug screen was negative while\n\nfather was positive for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Father was sentenced to 30 days in jail, and was ordered to report to jail\n\nthat afternoon. The court indicated that prior to the expiration of 30 days, if father was\n\naccepted to inpatient facility, a transfer from jail to the facility would be considered.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but the court allowed her 15 days\n\nto provide verification that she was accepted into inpatient treatment. The court noted, at\n\nthe end of 15 days, if no verification was filed, mother would serve 30 days in jail.\n\n                                Hearing - August 18, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 59} The hearing was held on the court\u2019s own motion; mother was present,\n\nfather was not. Mother did not go for inpatient treatment; she said it was very difficult to\n\nget into treatment because she was not with a provider and she had to care for T.V., who\n\nhad cancer and received chemotherapy. She claimed she had an assessment scheduled\n\nfor August 30, 2022, at A Renewed Mind (\u201cRenewed\u201d), after which she could go for IOP\n\nand counseling. She offered to go to jail on weekends and take care of T.V. during the\n\nweek, at least until she found another caregiver. She did not have verification of T.V.\u2019s\n\ncancer treatments.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f         {\u00b6 60} GAL Cook testified that T.V.\u2019s care was discussed the previous week, so\n\nmother had time to make alternate plans for his care. The GAL also noted mother was\n\nsentenced to 30 days in jail over eight months ago, so she had opportunities to address the\n\nissue.\n\n         {\u00b6 61} The court imposed the 30-day sentence and ordered mother to report to jail\n\nthe next day.\n\n                            Review Hearing - October 25, 2022\n\n         {\u00b6 62} Neither parent was present for the hearing. Mother claimed they were\n\ntravelling to court together when the car broke down, and they were waiting for the police\n\nto help.\n\n         {\u00b6 63} The caseworker reported she conducted a home visit with father outside of\n\nthe trailer, in September 2022, two days after he was released from jail. He began his\n\ncase plan; he attended IOP at Renewed, but missed sessions and he went to two parenting\n\nclasses, then missed one. He tested positive for alcohol and THC, and on October 11,\n\n2022, he was positive for meth. It was unknown if he worked. Father claimed he was\n\nselling the trailer, and listed mother\u2019s address as his address. He had supervised visits\n\nwith the children, which went well.\n\n         {\u00b6 64} After mother was released from jail, she attended IOP at Renewed, four\n\ndays a week. She resided with T.V., and although the caseworker stopped by the home\n\nmany times to see mother and conduct random drug screens, she was never home and\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fthere were no home visits since May 2022. Mother went to the agency to meet and took\n\ndrug tests, which were negative. Mother and father disclosed they were together, lived\n\ntogether at T.V.\u2019s home and had supervised visits with the children together. At that\n\npoint, the agency was not concerned about their relationship.\n\n       {\u00b6 65} The children were doing very well in the foster home where they were\n\nplaced in December 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} GAL Cook testified the case was in the same place that it was at the last\n\nhearing, with miniscule, incremental improvements. Father enrolled in treatment and\n\nparenting classes, but missed classes and had positive drug screens. Father never\n\ncompleted any treatment course and never had a negative drug screen. The GAL\n\nreported that in early 2022, after a court hearing, father had to be revived with Narcan.\n\n       {\u00b6 67} The court ordered that temporary custody of the children remain with the\n\nagency.\n\n            Fifth Semi-Annual Hearing\/GAL Report - December 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 68} GAL Cook filed a report with updates with respect to the family members.\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Mother and father were present for the hearing, and also before the court\n\nwas the agency\u2019s motion to extend temporary custody, filed on December 13, 2022. The\n\nagency withdrew its motion, as an extension was barred by statute.\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Caseworker Alaina Russell testified the children were doing very well in\n\ntheir foster home, and visited with the parents bi-weekly for two to three hours. Mother\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\fwas completing treatment at Renewed and doing well, but she missed dates due to T.V.\u2019s\n\nmedical appointments; T.V. had since passed away. She had three random drug tests and\n\none test at the agency; all were negative. Mother\u2019s last positive drug test was in June\n\n2022. She was on disability, did not work and lived with father at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Father was drug tested at Renewed and was negative for substances in\n\nNovember and December 2022, however during that time, Russell was unable to do\n\nhome visits with father or drug screens; his last screen, taken the end of October 2022,\n\nwas positive for THC. Father had a job and worked third shift. He completed two out of\n\nten parenting classes. Visits went very well, and the children were bonded to their\n\nparents.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} GAL Cook testified that father made considerable progress, at least on\n\npaper, but \u201cit is a touch disappointing that it comes too little too late.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} The court ordered that temporary custody remain with the agency.\n\n\n2023\n\n       {\u00b6 74} On January 31, 2023, the agency filed its motion for permanent custody of\n\nthe children. On February 2, 2023, the parents filed a joint motion to return the children\n\nto their care, as they alleged the agency did not timely file the permanent custody motion.\n\n                                 Hearing - March 23, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 75} The court noted two motions were pending: a motion for permanent\n\ncustody, filed by the agency on January 31, 2023; and the joint motion to dismiss. The\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\fcourt scheduled a trial on the motion for permanent custody and held a hearing on the\n\nmotion to dismiss. Both parents were present, and called Melinda Reynolds, the\n\nsupervisor of the agency\u2019s ongoing unit, as a witness.\n\n                              Melinda Reynolds\u2019 Testimony\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Reynolds was assigned as the ongoing caseworker for the family in\n\nFebruary 2023, and was familiar with the history of the case. She attempted home visits\n\nwith father in February 2023, but was unable to make contact. His last drug screen for\n\nthe agency, in mid-December 2022, was negative.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} On January 23, 2023, a police report was received which alleged that father\n\nhad overdosed. The agency tried to call father that day and the next to have him report\n\nfor a drug screen; no contact was made and father did not report. Father had claimed that\n\nhe worked so he was unable to go to the agency, so a caseworker offered to meet him at\n\nwork, or after, to drug screen him, but father did not cooperate. Father denied drug use.\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father attended services at Renewed, he tested negative for drugs and was\n\nlast seen on February 15, 2023. From October 2022 through January 2023, father missed\n\n17 IOP appointments at Renewed. Mother graduated from relapse prevention and\n\ncontinued \u201cto do individuals.\u201d Reynolds was unaware of any positive drug screens for\n\nmother since October 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father and mother told Reynolds they lived in T.V.\u2019s home and father\n\nworked.\n\n\n\n\n20.\n\f        {\u00b6 80} Reynolds stated substance abuse was a problem which was not resolved or\n\nsufficiently mitigated due to father\u2019s missed drug treatment appointments and his alleged\n\noverdose, where mother called 911 and stated father was turning blue in the face and she\n\nwas performing CPR on him. The police report indicated there was a strong and\n\noverwhelming odor of alcohol on father and there was a white substance in his nostrils.\n\n        {\u00b6 81} It was Reynolds\u2019 original belief that father was drug tested regularly\n\nthrough the IOP, but she learned he had not been tested in about five weeks.\n\n                                     Father\u2019s Testimony\n\n        {\u00b6 82} Father moved in with mother in August 2022, and was in drug treatment at\n\nOhio Guidestone (\u201cGuidestone\u201d)3 for three or four months; he said \u201c[i]t\u2019s been a while. *\n\n* * Well, since August [2022].\u201d He claimed his participation had been regular, but he\n\nstarted a job, had job training and had transportation issues, so it was difficult to attend,\n\nalthough he took drug screens. Since February 15, 2023, he said he was at Guidestone\n\nconsistently twice a week and was drug tested; he did not recall when his last positive\n\ndrug screen was, as \u201cit\u2019s been too long to even recall. * * * I mean it\u2019s been past August I\n\nmean.\u201d He had worked for three months, 40 hours a week.\n\n        {\u00b6 83} Father claimed the alleged overdose on January 23, 2023, was caused by\n\nblood clotting due to his leg injury, which made him get real hot and faint, and almost\n\ncaused a heart attack. He admitted he drank that day, but denied drug use. He said he\n\n\n\n3\n    Guidestone was formerly called A Renewed Mind.\n\n\n\n21.\n\fwent to Renewed on January 24, 25, 26 and 27, 2023, and took drug screens which were\n\nall negative. He did not have recent contact with Reynolds because she did not try to\n\nreach out to him to have him drug tested or do a home visit. Father said he would move\n\nout of the home, if required, so the children could be returned to mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} Father was asked if he remembered saying, at a Zoom meeting on\n\nJanuary 27, 2023, that a car fell on his chest on January 23, 2023, and took the air out of\n\nhim; he replied, \u201cI was working on my car and I remember coming in and sitting down\n\nand that\u2019s, I just got light headed and got real hot.\u201d Father was aware the police report\n\nstated he had a white substance in his nostrils, but he claimed that was \u201cFoam. Spit.\n\nSnot.\u201d He did not recall that the report said the police believed that father\u2019s two friends,\n\nwho were present, were also under the influence of narcotics.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Father was questioned about lying to the agency about his drug use and his\n\nrelationship with mother, and said, \u201cNo, I have not lied. We got back together in August.\n\n* * * They seen us together. Like I would go pick her up, take her to the store, stuff like\n\nthat, I mean, you know but we got back together in August.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father acknowledged he had to complete parenting classes, and was\n\nworking on it but \u201c[t]he woman, Jana, she is having problems cause see my schedule with\n\nwork and stuff to get me there. I already took five (5) classes of it. Only take ten (10)\n\nclasses.\u201d Father was informed he had only taken two classes, to which he replied, \u201cI got\n\nto wait on Jana to get actually room for me to go back in there to take them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n22.\n\f       {\u00b6 87} When asked what his sobriety date was, father responded it \u201cwould be\n\nAugust. I was in jail for thirty (30) days and after I\u2019ve got out I\u2019ve been, so is that, yea,\n\nsince I\u2019ve been clean? * * * Yea, it was I would say August.\u201d He did not recall testing\n\npositive for marijuana on October 26, 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} GAL Cook asked father when IOP with Guidestone would be completed\n\nand father said next week; father did not know how long the program usually took.\n\nFather admitted that on January 23, 2023, he drank three big cans of beer which was like\n\na six-pack. He was asked if drinking was recommended as part of his sobriety and he\n\nreplied, \u201cIt\u2019s not anything you know, I mean.\u201d He said he drank once in a while, not\n\nregularly.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} The court asked father about consuming alcohol, and observed that\n\ndrinking a six-pack at one time seemed to fly in the face of the sobriety issues, to which\n\nfather replied, \u201cI understand where you are coming from, yea. It was a six (6) pack but it\n\nwas between me and a friend you know, so, so what I had a total of you know.\u201d The\n\ncourt told father he just changed his testimony, and father said, \u201cUh, yea, I understand\n\nwhere, yea.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Father failed to bring documentation of his Guidestone treatment, but said,\n\n\u201cI talked to Lisa yesterday and she was going to fax over paperwork. I could actually get\n\nit faxed to [the caseworker] like soon as I leave here. That I have actually been going or\n\nyou know contact Lisa and have her get a hold of the caseworker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\f       {\u00b6 91} GAL Cook observed that based on father\u2019s testimony, his drug use was not\n\nseriously mitigated and there were many occasions when his sobriety was called into\n\nquestion, even by father\u2019s own testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6 92} The court allowed the parties time to file Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law, as to whether the cases should be dismissed since timeliness was not met, or\n\nwhether the court had jurisdiction so the cases could go to trial. The court recessed.\n\n              Judgment Entry on Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 93} The juvenile court found that it retained jurisdiction of the cases, and\n\ndenied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court\u2019s findings are more fully set forth\n\nbelow, under mother and father\u2019s first assignments of error.\n\n                            Mother\u2019s Motion to Return Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 94} On April 14, 2023, mother filed a motion to return custody of the children\n\nto her or to grant legal custody to paternal grandmother. In May 2023, mother withdrew\n\nher motion to grant legal custody of the children to paternal grandmother.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 1, May 19, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Two motions were before the court: the agency\u2019s motion for permanent\n\ncustody and mother\u2019s motion to return custody of the children to her. The court reserved\n\nits finding on mother\u2019s motion until after testimony was heard. The trial on the motion\n\nfor permanent custody trial proceeded. Mother attended the first, second and fourth days\n\nof trial, father did not attend the trial.\n\n\n\n\n24.\n\fSgt. Jason Sprague\n\n       {\u00b6 96} The sergeant was called as a witness by the Williams County prosecutor,\n\nand testified to the following. He worked for the Montpelier Police Department (\u201cMPD\u201d)\n\nand on December 11, 2019, he received a medical call that a person got out of bed and\n\ncollapsed on the floor. Upon arrival at T.V.\u2019s home, father, T.V., mother and mother\u2019s\n\ntwo older children were present. Father was on the floor, pale, snarling when he breathed\n\nand with an accelerated pulse rate, which were all general signs of an overdose. The\n\nsergeant was also aware of father\u2019s history of drug abuse, and it was suspected that father\n\nused heroin. Narcan was administered and eventually father became conscious.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} Father claimed he had a sleeping disorder and denied using drugs, even\n\nthough the sergeant explained that Narcan only disrupted an opioid overdose, and given\n\nfather\u2019s reaction to Narcan it was pretty obvious what happened. Father was given an\n\nimmunity letter, which gave a drug abuser 30 days to check into rehab or potentially face\n\ncriminal charges. Father did not go to rehab, nor was he criminally charged.\n\nLt. Darrell Higbie\n\n       {\u00b6 98} The lieutenant was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing. He worked for the MPD and on July 15, 2022, around noontime, he\n\nresponded to a med call that a male was breathing, but unresponsive. When Lt. Higbie\n\npulled up to the house, he recognized it and knew mother, father and T.V. lived there.\n\n\n\n\n25.\n\fFather was on the floor of the garage and life squad treated him for a possible drug\n\noverdose, due to a previous incident.\n\n       {\u00b6 99} Lt. Higbie spoke with T.V., who said father was at court that morning and\n\nhad to report to jail later that day. Mother arrived and was told father overdosed again.\n\nShe said father was not supposed to hang out with Troy Smith, who trafficked drugs.\n\nFather was revived with Narcan, and wanted to know what was going on. Father was\n\nasked what drugs he took; he said he did not take any drugs. Father was informed that\n\nNarcan only worked on opioid use, not heart attacks, strokes or epilepsy. The lieutenant\n\nlooked for evidence of drugs in the home, but found none. Father refused to go to the\n\nhospital, and was not charged with a crime.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} The lieutenant did not recall being told at the scene that father tested\n\npositive at court that morning for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol. Based on that\n\ninformation, Lt. Higbie believed that father did some type of opioid between the time he\n\nwas in court and the time he became unresponsive.\n\nPatrolman Austin Batt\n\n       {\u00b6 101} The officer was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing. He worked for the MPD and on January 22, 2023,4 he received a call for a full\n\n\n\n\n4\n Two dates were referenced regarding father\u2019s alleged overdose: January 22 and 23,\n2023. We will refer to January 23, 2023.\n\n\n\n26.\n\farrest, which was believed to be an overdose. The officer was advised that mother called,\n\nand she was performing CPR.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} Upon Officer Batt\u2019s arrival at the house, mother said father was dead and\n\nwas blue in the face. She accused father of using an illegal substance that he got at Circle\n\nK. Mother appeared normal but distraught, and she looked frustrated with father as she\n\nbelieved he used illegal drugs and overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The officer found father was alert and conscious, but heavily intoxicated.\n\nFather had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from his breath, there were white\n\ncrystal-like debris hanging out of his nostrils, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, his\n\nspeech was slurred, he was unable to have a conversation, he thought everything was\n\nfunny, he could not maintain his balance, and he had body tremors. Father admitted\n\ndrinking five 24-ounce cans of Milwaukee Ice Beer, but denied taking any illegal\n\nsubstances or overdosing. Father claimed he fell asleep and was epileptic; he did not\n\nmention a blood clot. Father\u2019s heart rate was high, which was an indicator of being under\n\nthe influence of a stimulant like meth or cocaine. Father was not given Narcan and he\n\nrefused to go the hospital. He was not criminally charged, as no drugs or paraphernalia\n\nwere found.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The officer recalled that father\u2019s cousin and a friend were also at the\n\nhouse and they both had indicators that they were under the influence, as they had\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\fbloodshot, glassy eyes, they had body tremors and could not maintain steady balance.\n\nThe cousin said father was unconscious, and the cousin breathed for father.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} Officer Batt believed mother and father were girlfriend and boyfriend, as\n\nthe officer stopped father\u2019s car the previous week for a traffic violation at which time\n\nfather said he was trying to get home, where he lived with mother.\n\nAttorney Abigail Wurm\n\n       {\u00b6 106} Wurm was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was an attorney for the estate of T.V., who died on December 13, 2022.\n\nMother and father lived at T.V.\u2019s home at the time of T.V.\u2019s death. T.V. had a will which\n\nprovided that five beneficiaries, including mother, were to split the estate.\n\n       {\u00b6 107} Mother was advised that she and father could stay at T.V.\u2019s home, and\n\npay the utilities, until mother was able to secure financing to purchase the home. Mother\n\ncould not get a loan, so on January 26, 2023, a thirty-day notice to vacate the home was\n\nserved. At that time, Wurm noticed a door hanger on the house which stated the village\n\nwould shut off utilities as of January 31, 2023. Wurm learned that mother and father had\n\nnot paid the utilities, as they promised. Wurm also learned the utilities were shut off.\n\n       {\u00b6 108} Wurm received verification that mother and father had vacated the home\n\non February 20, 2023; the locks on the home were changed and the home was listed for\n\nsale. When mother and father vacated the home, there was nothing left in the home; the\n\nstove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, all of the appliances were gone.\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\f       {\u00b6 109} Wurm testified that T.V. had a 2003 Chevy Trailblaze which showed up\n\non Facebook on January 23, 2023, as having been sold by father for $250. Wurm was not\n\naware that father had authorization to sell the vehicle, and she knew he did not have a\n\ntitle to the vehicle. A complaint against father was filed with the police department.\n\n       {\u00b6 110} Wurm estimated that mother may receive $15,000 to $18,000 when T.V.\u2019s\n\nestate closed, which was anticipated to be in the fall of 2023.\n\nJana Richards\n\n       {\u00b6 111} Richards was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was a counselor at Shalom Counseling and Mediation Center (\u201cShalom\u201d),\n\nand also was the supervised visitation coordinator and parenting instructor.\n\n       {\u00b6 112} Richards supervised the parents\u2019 visit with the children. Father was\n\nreferred for supervised visits at Shalom in May 2021, mother was referred in June 2021.\n\nRichards was instructed to schedule visits every other week, for two hours, but there were\n\ngaps in the visits due to mother\u2019s inpatient treatment and father\u2019s incarceration and\n\ninability to pay for visits. Visits ended in February 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Richards directed mother\u2019s parenting classes, which started with\n\norientation on April 8, 2021, and ended December 2, 2021, when mother completed the\n\nclasses. The gap between mother\u2019s orientation and classes was due to her positive drug\n\nscreen in late April 2021, and subsequent inpatient treatment.\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f       {\u00b6 114} As for father, he was referred for parenting classes on September 28,\n\n2022, and he completed two out of the ten required classes. After he missed two classes,\n\nhe was \u201cpulled from group and then he would have to start the next cycle.\u201d During\n\nsupervised visits with the children, father mentioned the parenting classes to Richards,\n\nand he was informed that he had to reach out to remind her at another time; he never did.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Richards\u2019 general observations of mother and father\u2019s visits with the\n\nchildren were \u201c[l]ots of love and affection * * * praise and encouragement,\u201d and there\n\nwere no issues with the parents at visits. Richards observed mother applying what she\n\nhad learned in parenting classes at the visits, definitely the positive aspects, although\n\nmother could improve on providing consequences for behaviors. Richards recommended\n\nunsupervised visits for mother and father with the children.\n\nLisa Michel\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Michel was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was a behavioral health counselor at Guidestone, formerly Renewed. She\n\nwas mother and father\u2019s counselor, although they saw other providers too. Mother was in\n\ngroup, while father saw the nurse and nurse practitioner.\n\n       {\u00b6 117} Mother had her assessment on September 28, 2022, and was directed to\n\ntake IOP and individual counseling; she did really great. Mother was drug screened,\n\nusually twice a week, and had no positive screens. Mother missed some appointments,\n\nbut it was not enough to be removed from the program, as she always contacted Michel\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fto let her know. Michel had no concerns with mother during her treatment, as every\n\nrecommendation was completed and mother was discharged on April 4, 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Father started services in April or May 2021, and was discharged on\n\nJune 1, 2021. He was in rehab for one day, June 8 to June 9, 2022, and went back, in\n\nOctober 2022, for counseling with Michel and medication assisted treatment (\u201cMET\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Father did well at first with counseling, but then missed appointments.\n\nDuring the fall of 2022 and winter of 2022-2023, he was supposed to go to Guidestone\n\nfour days a week, but from November 2022 through April 2023, he missed 24\n\nappointments and was removed from group. Father was drug screened by Michel twice a\n\nweek; he was positive for THC and alcohol on November 2, 2022, but had negative\n\nscreens thereafter.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} Father was in MET and on Suboxone from October 4, 2022 until\n\nDecember 1, 2022, when he was discharged for noncompliance. He was drug screened\n\nby MET and was positive on June 8, 2022, for meth, amphet, alcohol, fentanyl,\n\nnorfentanyl and THC, and on October 25, 2022, for THC and Hydromorphone.\n\n       {\u00b6 121} Father completed IOP, which had 36 sessions, but did not complete the\n\nstep-down, relapse prevention, which had 12 sessions and was part of the programming.\n\nIf father were to contact Michel, residential treatment would be recommended.\n\n\n\n\n31.\n\f       {\u00b6 122} Regarding mother and father\u2019s relationship, Michel was initially told they\n\nwere friends, then she found out they were together. In April 2023, mother told Michel\n\nthat she broke up with father.\n\n       {\u00b6 123} Michel was aware that father allegedly overdosed on January 23, 2023,\n\nand noted that he did not take a drug screen until January 26, 2023. She was asked if she\n\nwould challenge father\u2019s March 23, 2023 testimony, that he was very compliant with\n\nGuidestone and his treatment, as untruthful; Michel responded she would.\n\nJerome Pete Reed\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Reed was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was employed as a certified scientist with Forensic Fluids Laboratory\n\n(\u201cFFL\u201d), which specialized in oral fluid drug testing. He mentioned that drugs in the\n\nblood also affect saliva. Reed stated it was virtually impossible for FFL\u2019s tests to have a\n\nfalse positive. He also said you could not test positive for meth if you sat next to a user,\n\nkissed or had sex with a user.\n\n       {\u00b6 125} Reed recalled that FFL processed drug tests for mother, as requested by\n\nthe agency, and there were three positive results: on April 29, 2020, positive for oxy; and\n\non April 19 and May 28, 2021, positive for meth and amphet. He explained that the body\n\ntried to excrete meth by converting it to amphet, and with ADHD drugs, like Adderall, a\n\ndrug test would also be positive for amphet. Reed noted meth use could be detected in\n\noral fluid for up to about 18 hours.\n\n\n\n\n32.\n\f        {\u00b6 126} FFL processed drug tests for father, as requested by the agency, with the\n\nfollowing positive results: on May 10, 2021, positive for THC; on May 21, 2021, positive\n\nfor meth, amphet, THC, cocaine, Benzoylecgonine (\u201cBZE\u201d) and Ecgonine Methyl Ester\n\n(\u201cEME\u201d); on June 4, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC; on October 5, 2021,\n\npositive for THC; and on October 14, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC. Reed\n\nexplained that the body broke down cocaine into BZE, and then EME.\n\n        {\u00b6 127} Reed noted the medications father listed for November 2, 2021, were oxy\n\nand enoxaparin (which is a blood thinner, not used for epilepsy), yet father\u2019s drug test\n\nwas positive for meth, amphet and THC; no listed medications were found. On\n\nNovember 19, and December 16, 2021, father was positive for meth, amphet and THC;\n\non December 27, 2021, he was positive for Percocet (which is oxy), meth, amphet and\n\nTHC; on May 4, September 13 and October 26, 2022, he was positive for THC; and on\n\nMarch 23, 2023, father was positive for fentanyl.\n\n        {\u00b6 128} Reed explained that fentanyl use could be detected in oral fluid for up to\n\nabout 24 hours, and THC (by smoking marijuana) can be detected for up to 36 hours.\n\n        {\u00b6 129} Reed noted father had one negative result, which was on December 15,\n\n2022.\n\n        {\u00b6 130} Reed observed that it took an extensive amount of time of chronic drug\n\nuse to register a positive in a hair follicle test. Chronic drug usage would be several times\n\na week for several months before the drug would register on a hair follicle test.\n\n\n\n\n33.\n\fMelinda Reynolds\n\n        {\u00b6 131} Reynolds was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony she offered at the March 23, 2023 hearing on parents\u2019\n\nmotion to dismiss. In addition to that testimony, she testified to the following. At the\n\nagency, she worked as a social services supervisor where she oversaw the ongoing unit in\n\nall ongoing cases, and sometimes worked as an ongoing caseworker. She was the\n\nsupervisor for the family since April 1, 2021, and was assigned as the caseworker in\n\n2023. Four other agency employees had worked on the case at times, since August 18,\n\n2020.\n\n        {\u00b6 132} Regarding father\u2019s overdose in December 2019, the agency\u2019s notes\n\nshowed that mother\u2019s two oldest children and M.M. were present, and the oldest child\n\nand T.V. performed CPR on father. The agency opened a case, substantiated for physical\n\nabuse, but the case was not transferred to ongoing services and was closed.\n\n        {\u00b6 133} On April 29, 2020, the agency received a report that mother tested\n\npositive for illegal drugs while giving birth to B.M., but she denied the use of drugs other\n\nthan Zantac, Gabapentin and Amoxicillin. She admitted that father used THC, but\n\nclaimed no other substances were used in the home. On May 12, 2020, mother claimed\n\nshe did not realize she was in active labor so she took two Percocets for pain, and in the\n\nhospital, she was given oxy every six hours.\n\n\n\n\n34.\n\f       {\u00b6 134} Mother sent the agency an email on May 2, 2020, indicating she was not\n\ntogether with father, and he moved to Kentucky, as his other children were \u201cbeing\n\nadopted out.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 135} On May 28, 2020, mother was drug tested by the agency, and was positive\n\nfor meth and amphet; she denied ever using meth. Shortly afterwards, the children were\n\n\u201csafety planned\u201d with T.V., and case plans were created.\n\n                                        Case Plans\n\nGoal\n\n       {\u00b6 136} The initial, overall case plan goal was reunification of the family.\n\nHousing\n\n       {\u00b6 137} In April 2020, when the agency became involved with the family, mother\n\nlived at T.V.\u2019s home. On September 28, 2020, mother indicated that father was back in\n\ntown. On October 13, 2020, mother reported that father moved out and moved into his\n\nmother\u2019s house in Defiance, Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 138} On December 11, 2020, mother reported she bought a trailer and would\n\nmove in January 2021, which she did. On March 1, 2021, mother reported she had been\n\nback and forth between T.V.\u2019s home and the trailer, as she was working on getting the\n\nbathroom fixed. On April 22, 2021, a caseworker went to the trailer unannounced and\n\nfather opened the door; he became upset, refused a drug screen and refused to work with\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\fthe caseworker. On October 28, 2021, the agency learned that mother did not own the\n\ntrailer and that she moved to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 139} On October 26, 2022, father notified the agency that he lived with mother\n\nin T.V.\u2019s home and was no longer living in the trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 140} A March 25, 2023 police report indicated that mother and father were\n\nliving together on Vine Street in Sherwood, Ohio, but on April 17, 2023, father emailed\n\nthe agency that he was moving to Lexington, Kentucky. On April 21, 2023, mother\n\nreported that she did not live at T.V.\u2019s home; she stayed with friends or family or in her\n\ncar. Mother\u2019s address was requested for eight weeks, and the day before the May 19,\n\n2023 trial, mother emailed a signed a lease for the Vine Street trailer (\u201cVine trailer\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 141} Reynolds noted the agency only communicated with father via email, as\n\nthere were occasions when he was very threatening with a caseworker. Reynolds had not\n\nemailed father since April 2023, because he had responded to her emails with \u201cLOL\u201d\n\nwhen she asked him for his address or where he was. The day before trial, Reynolds saw\n\nthat father\u2019s Facebook post said he was in Fremont, Ohio.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 142} Reynolds was not able to conduct home visits in March, April or May,\n\n2023, for mother or father.\n\n\n\n\n36.\n\fEmployment\n\n      {\u00b6 143} Mother reported that she received $400 a month in SSDI, and the children\n\nalso received SSDI, which money was redirected to the agency. Reynolds believed that if\n\nmother had housing and the children were returned to her, she would get over $1,000 per\n\nmonth.\n\n      {\u00b6 144} Father reported, on May 24, 2021, that he worked at Mansion\u2019s; he\n\nprovided no verification. On October 4, 2021, he told the caseworker he received SSDI\n\nand did side jobs, and on October 15, 2021, he reported that he worked in Michigan; he\n\nprovided no verification. On November 25, 2021, he reported he injured his leg and was\n\nnot working.\n\n      {\u00b6 145} On May 4, 2022, father claimed he worked at a tire place by the Ford\n\ndealer in Bryan, Ohio; he provided no verification. On July 15, 2022, he indicated he\n\nworked at an oil change place in town; he provided no verification. In August 2022,\n\nfather was in jail and did not work. In November 2022, the agency received proof that\n\nfather collected SSDI.\n\n      {\u00b6 146} On January 23, 2023, father reported that he worked at CK Technologies;\n\nhe showed his ID badge and confirmed his employment.\n\n\n\n\n37.\n\fPRC Application\n\n        {\u00b6 147} Mother completed her application; it was approved in June 2021. Father\n\nwas given six applications before he completed one, which was approved in November\n\n2022.\n\nVisitation and Parenting Classes\n\n        {\u00b6 148} There were no issues with parents\u2019 supervised visits with the children,\n\nexcept that mother struggled to follow through with discipline. The agency gave the\n\nparents gas vouchers for visits with the children. By February 2023, parents were\n\nallowed additional visits, which were supervised by the foster mom. Mother was very\n\nrespectful with the foster parents, and father typically did not interact with them.\n\n        {\u00b6 149} Reynolds noted that generally when reunification is the goal, parents\n\nstarted with supervised visits, then moved to unsupervised visits to transition their\n\nchildren back into the home before their children returned home. However, mother and\n\nfather always had supervised visits because, throughout the case, mother was dishonest\n\nwith the agency about her relationship with father, so she did not build trust with the\n\nagency. Reynolds was aware that in January 2023, a joint motion was filed by the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s office requesting unsupervised visits for the parents, which showed it was\n\nnot the agency\u2019s decision for the parents to have supervised visits with the children.\n\n\n\n\n38.\n\f       {\u00b6 150} Mother attended and completed all required parenting classes by\n\nDecember 2021, while father attended two classes out of ten and never completed the\n\nparenting class goal.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 151} The agency required visits with the parents every month, with home visits\n\nevery other month, some of which were unannounced; it was mandated that the agency\n\nmake three attempts a month for a home visit. The other visits were held at the agency or\n\na neutral site.\n\n       {\u00b6 152} For mother, home visits were unsuccessful in May and November 2022\n\nand February 2023, while visits were successful in July and December 2022 and January\n\n2023, but two attempts were be made before visits occurred. No home visits were\n\nattempted in March, April and May 2023, because mother did not provide her address to\n\nthe agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 153} With father, home visits were not successful in September, October,\n\nNovember and December 2020; January, April and July 2021; April, June and December\n\n2022; and January, February and April 2023.\n\nSubstance Abuse, Drug Screens and Mental Health Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 154} In November 2020, mother engaged in treatment at Recovery, disengaged\n\nin February 2021, and reengaged in March 2021. She was accepted at FIC in February\n\n2021. FIC was an intensive program, with four phases, starting with weekly meetings\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fbetween the parent and a treatment team of providers, which included the agency\u2019s\n\ndirector, then meeting every other week, then every three weeks, and finally, a meeting\n\nevery four weeks until the parent graduated and was discharged from the program.\n\nMother was unsuccessfully discharged from FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 155} In April 2021, mother was admitted for inpatient treatment at Serenity. In\n\nMay 2021, it was reported to the agency that mother was having regular contact with\n\nfather, she did not follow the rules when it came to father, and she appeared very co-\n\ndependent. In August 2021, mother was successfully discharged from Serenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 156} Mother tested positive for meth on September 1, 2021, but denied using;\n\nshe claimed she had sex with father the night before, which made the test positive. She\n\nalso was positive for meth on September 22, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 157} In December 2021, a contempt hearing was held because mother was\n\ntested by FIC and was positive for meth, twice. She was found in contempt and ordered\n\nto attend inpatient treatment.\n\n       {\u00b6 158} Mother was admitted to Serenity again, in January 2022, and released in\n\nApril 2022. On July 7 and 15, 2022, Recovery tested mother and she was positive for\n\nmeth; she denied using drug, and claimed her drink was spiked by her sister. In late\n\nSeptember 2022, mother informed the agency she switched services to Guidestone, and\n\nno longer wanted to go to Recovery or complete inpatient treatment. In April 2023,\n\nmother successfully completed treatment at Guidestone and was discharged.\n\n\n\n\n40.\n\f       {\u00b6 159} Father was assessed at Guidestone, in April 2021, and IOP was\n\nrecommended, but he failed to follow the recommendation. Father was referred to FIC, a\n\nmeeting was scheduled but he did not appear. Father was denied admission into FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 160} In October 2021, father was assessed at Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; treatment was recommended. Father was discharged from\n\nRecovery in December 2021, due to lack of attendance.\n\n       {\u00b6 161} In January 2022, father requested to be removed from the case plan, as he\n\nwas facing contempt charges; he was removed. In March 2022, father asked to be placed\n\nback on the case plan; he was added to the case plan. The caseworker told father the\n\nagency wanted him to go to inpatient treatment, but he said he did not have time to do\n\nthat. Father also said he never wanted to be on the case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 162} In April 2022, father had another assessment at Guidestone and residential\n\ntreatment was recommended; he refused to go saying that place does not help and there\n\nare more drugs there than on the streets. In June 2022, father went to inpatient for one\n\nday, then disengaged from services until he was assessed again at Guidestone in October\n\n2022. IOP was recommended, but father quit attending all services in March 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 163} Father refused to drug test for the agency in: August 2020; April 2021;\n\nMarch 2022; and January 2023, following the alleged overdose.\n\n\n\n\n41.\n\f                                   Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 164} Mother and father claimed on numerous occasions that they were not in a\n\nrelationship, but the agency believed otherwise. When mother was in Serenity for the\n\nfirst time in the spring of 2021, she had contact with father and it appeared, at that time,\n\nthat she had no intention of ending her relationship with him. In August 2021, mother\n\nindicated to the agency she had broken up with father, but in a jail video from\n\nSeptember 23, 2021, she told father she was going to tell the court what it wanted to hear,\n\nwhich was that they broke up, but she had no intention of breaking up and throwing away\n\nfive years.\n\n       {\u00b6 165} On October 15, 2021, mother told the agency she and father were together\n\nand possibly moving to Michigan. On December 3, 2021, mother reported that she had\n\nbroken up with father, and on April 6, 2022, she said she was finished with him for good.\n\n       {\u00b6 166} On April 26, 2022, the agency received a police report stating that father\n\nwas charged with falsification for pawning a gun in Defiance, Ohio. Father indicated to\n\nthe officer that the gun belonged to his girlfriend (mother), but he pawned it because she\n\ndid not have her license on her at the time. Later, father requested the gun back and filled\n\nout an ATF form which reflected that he had no previous misdemeanor domestic violence\n\ncharges, but father had a domestic violence conviction in Bryan, Ohio, and it was\n\npresumed that mother was the victim. Reynolds knew it was illegal, under federal law,\n\nfor father to own a firearm. Father admitted that he lied on the form, and faced charges.\n\n\n\n\n42.\n\fReynolds was concerned that father had a firearm, as he had made threats against the\n\ncourt and the agency, saying he would blow that place up and they are all going to pay; it\n\nwas unclear to which place father was referring. Reynolds also learned of domestic\n\nviolence accusations made against father in Kentucky by his other children\u2019s mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 167} Reynolds noted that the parents were seen together at Wal-Mart in April\n\n2022, father asked the children at a visit if they saw the puppy that he and mother bought\n\ntogether, and through most of the case, mother used father\u2019s last name on Facebook.\n\n       {\u00b6 168} Mother was told at the March 23, 2023 hearing that if she was not with\n\nfather, she could potentially have the children returned to her. Father had a Facebook\n\npost saying he and mother had broken up and were living separately. However, Reynolds\n\nlearned from father\u2019s mother that from March through May 2023, the parents lived\n\ntogether.\n\n                                 Parents\u2019 Other Children\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Mother has two older children, and one child\u2019s biological father had legal\n\ncustody.\n\n       {\u00b6 170} Father had two older children, but his parental rights were involuntarily\n\nterminated for these children in August 2020, in Kentucky.\n\n                                     Foster Parents\n\n       {\u00b6 171} The children were the same foster parents since the emergency removal in\n\nDecember 2021. The children were happy, settled and very bonded with the foster\n\n\n\n\n43.\n\fparents, they go on vacations together. The children have their own beds, own rooms,\n\nown toys and own clothes at the foster home. The foster parents wished to adopt the\n\nchildren. The foster parents communicated with X.H.\u2019s foster parents and the children\n\nhave regular contact with X.H., which would continue if the agency were granted\n\npermanent custody of the children.\n\n                                        Opinions\n\n       {\u00b6 172} Reynolds opined it would be disruptive to the children, especially M.M.,\n\nif there were a placement change. In Reynolds\u2019 training she learned that every move for\n\na child was traumatizing, and children who were disrupted constantly or had placement\n\nchanges were more likely to have mental health issues, more likely to struggle in school,\n\nand less likely to go to college.\n\n       {\u00b6 173} Reynolds\u2019 opined it would be in the children\u2019s best interests for them to\n\nbe placed in the permanent custody of the agency, and for the permanency goal to be\n\nchanged to adoption. Reynolds believed if the children were returned to mother, CPS\n\nwould likely have to continue its involvement, and the children would continue to have\n\nplacement disruptions and changes. The children needed a legally secure, permanent\n\nplacement.\n\nThomas Custer\n\n       {\u00b6 174} Tom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was father\u2019s stepfather and was married to Debbie Custer, father\u2019s mother,\n\n\n\n\n44.\n\ffor 14 years. Tom did not know the children well, he thought M.M. may know him and\n\nDebbie, but B.M. had only been to the Custer home twice. The Custers did not have\n\nvisits with the children while they were in foster care, because \u201cit was two (2) years\n\nbefore we even knew they were there.\u201d Tom learned the children were in foster care two\n\nor three months prior to trial when the agency contacted him and Debbie about taking\n\ncustody. Tom said he and Debbie were older and had too many health issues to run after\n\nand raise little kids.\n\n       {\u00b6 175} The Custers had a close acquaintance-type relationship with mother, and\n\nTom thought she was a good parent. Tom has a \u201clabored\u201d relationship with father; if\n\nfather got what he wanted, he was good to be around, but if father got mad, he was a\n\nwhole different person - angry and making threats. Tom tried to keep his distance from\n\nfather, as father threatened to beat Tom up, mop the floor with him and put him in a pine\n\nbox. Tom said he and his wife were not afraid of father, Tom just does not want the\n\ndrama. Tom recalled that father said the Defiance Police stopped by, and father talked\n\nwith them.\n\n       {\u00b6 176} Tom remembered that from January 2023, until about a month ago when\n\nthe Custers told the agency they would not take the children, mother and father were at\n\nthe Custer home two or three times a week, and father came out one time without mother.\n\nTom said mother and father took showers at the Custer home. After father was notified\n\n\n\n\n45.\n\fthat the Custers would not take the children, he threatened Debbie, so she blocked him on\n\nthe phone and everything.\n\n        {\u00b6 177} In about April 2023, when mother called Debbie and asked for Narcan,\n\nTom overheard the call. Mother said she was out and when she got home, she found\n\nfather comatose and she did not know what he did or took. Debbie told mother to take\n\nfather to the hospital or call 911. A few hours later, mother and father arrived at the\n\nCuster home and father had slurred speech, \u201ca little balance,\u201d and was under the influence\n\nof something. Tom said father drank, but did not admit to doing drugs. Tom said he\n\ndoes not believe that father knew what the word \u201chonesty\u201d meant, as father had a\n\ndelusional version of the truth. Tom said father had five children, with three women.\n\nTom thought father knew how to manipulate mother, and was good at it.\n\n        {\u00b6 178} Tom saw mother the day before trial when she came out to the Custer\n\nhome to retrieve the children\u2019s clothes, dressers, car seats and things. The items were at\n\nT.V.\u2019s home, but were moved to the Custer home when mother and father left T.V.\u2019s\n\nhome.\n\n        {\u00b6 179} Tom saw and talked to father the morning of trial, at the Vine trailer.\n\nTom went to get his ladder and rake which he lent to father, as \u201cthere was a big falling\n\nout.\u201d Tom and his brother found the Vine trailer because a dresser mother picked up the\n\nnight before \u201csat right there.\u201d The two men went to the back door, which was unlocked,\n\n\n\n\n46.\n\fand opened it; the brother said someone was inside, so Tom looked and father \u201cpopped\n\nout and he started doing the [father] thing.\u201d Father said he just woke up.\n\n       {\u00b6 180} Tom told the prosecutor, when he talked to her the previous weekend, that\n\nmother and father were still together, and lived together on Vine Street. However, when\n\nTom spoke to mother the night before trial, she said father left.\n\n       {\u00b6 181} Tom does not know what mother and father\u2019s living arrangement was, but\n\nfather told Tom that he and mother had slept in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Father said\n\nmother bought a trailer after T.V. died, and father was fixing it up. Tom said after T.V.\n\npassed away and mother and father had to move out of T.V.\u2019s home \u201cthe world flipped\n\nupside down.\u201d Mother and father asked to stay at the Custer home and were told no,\n\nalthough Tom said mother was welcome anytime, but without father.\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Tom talked to mother the day of trial during a smoke break, and she asked\n\nTom what father was doing at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 183} Tom believed the children should be returned to mother, but should not be\n\nreturned to father.\n\nFoster mom\n\n       {\u00b6 184} Foster mom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to\n\nthe following. She was a married, third-grade teacher and her husband was a pipefitter.\n\nThe children have lived with the foster parents for one and a half years; M.M. was three\n\nyears old and B.M. was one when they entered foster care. At first, M.M. cried a lot and\n\n\n\n\n47.\n\fit took time for her to get used to the foster parents and daycare centers, but she really\n\nimproved. B.M. was a go-with-the-flow kid, so the transition was easier for him.\n\n       {\u00b6 185} M.M. was silly and all girl, and she liked to do girl stuff with foster mom.\n\nM.M. and foster dad were the silliest together, as foster dad was the play around person,\n\nand M.M. loved to hang out with him. M.M. was really loving with the foster parents, as\n\nwas B.M., who was also very cuddly. The children loved to go outside to play with\n\nfoster dad, they rode bikes and scooters, played and hiked in the woods, took the dog for\n\na walk, and swam and went to the zoo in the summer.\n\n       {\u00b6 186} The children improved a lot, especially their speech, as the foster parents\n\nworked with them since they arrived. Daycare helped the children improve socially and\n\nalso helped their speech. The children were really good with other kids. B.M. was in\n\nHead Start, and the children both had IEPs for speech at their school in Bowling Green.\n\n       {\u00b6 187} Foster mom was pregnant with her first child. The children are treated as\n\npart of the foster family, they were very bonded to each other, they played really well\n\ntogether for the most part, and slept in the same room, as they did not want to be\n\nseparated.\n\n       {\u00b6 188} The foster parents wanted to adopt the children, as they were a part of the\n\nfamily for almost two years, and the foster parents were definitely comfortable keeping\n\nthe children long-term.\n\n\n\n\n48.\n\f       {\u00b6 189} Foster mom believed if M.M. were disrupted again and moved around,\n\nback and forth, it would be hard and confusing on her to adjust to different settings. With\n\nB.M., foster mom would be concerned about his behavior, because when B.M. met\n\nsomeone new at daycare, he had behaviors, but \u201cafter they kind of get his number, he\u2019s\n\nbetter.\u201d Foster mom was worried that B.M. would develop poor behaviors if he was\n\naround different adults and had to go back and forth.\n\n       {\u00b6 190} Recently, foster mom supervised visits between the children and mother\n\nand father; foster mom and mother made the arrangements. Outside of visits, foster mom\n\nhad no contact with father. The visits were roughly every two weeks for two hours or so,\n\nat a place like the park or McDonald\u2019s. Mother was very loving towards the children and\n\nthey were excited to see her, but they got a little wild and hyped-up with father, which\n\nwas not that concerning. The children were bonded with mother and father, and talked\n\nabout them all of the time. X.H. was also at visits, as his foster parent brought him. The\n\nchildren loved to see X.H., and he was very sweet and caring to them. X.H. came to\n\nB.M.\u2019s birthday party at the foster home, and was really great with the kids. If the foster\n\nparents adopted the children, visits with X.H. would continue. Foster mom believed the\n\nchildren needed consistency and that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain with\n\nthe foster parents permanently.\n\n\n\n\n49.\n\f                   Permanent Custody Trial - Day 2, May 22, 2023\n\nGAL\n\n       {\u00b6 191} GAL Cook was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony he offered at previous hearings. The GAL also testified\n\nthat the children needed a legally secure, permanent placement, and permanent removal\n\nfrom mother and father was probably in the children\u2019s best interests, as were permanent\n\ncustody and adoption.\n\nMelinda Reynolds\n\n       {\u00b6 192} Reynolds testified about the children\u2019s previous placements with family\n\nmembers, and the efforts made to try to place the children permanently or long-term with\n\nrelatives.\n\nMother\n\n       {\u00b6 193} Mother testified to the following.\n\n                                  Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 194} Around the time of B.M.\u2019s birth, mother and father were off and on, and\n\nnot \u201csolely together.\u201d After B.M. was born, father took off. She was unaware that father\n\nhad his parental rights to two children terminated in 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 195} Mother acknowledged that some time before the September 2021 jail\n\nphone call between her and father, she was probably told she should not be with father if\n\nshe wanted the children back.\n\n\n\n\n50.\n\f       {\u00b6 196} In the fall of 2022, mother was on and off with father, and \u201call I wanted to\n\ndo was give him the benefit of the doubt and change for his children. * * * I like stayed\n\naway for a while and he kept coming back saying oh he\u2019s going to change. You know\n\nhe\u2019s going to do this, he\u2019s going to do that, but * * * he never did.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 197} At the March 2023 court hearing, mother told father \u201cif you fail this drug\n\nscreen, I\u2019m done. Like I\u2019m done done. I can\u2019t do it no more. * * * I\u2019m tired of looking at\n\nsomebody that\u2019s saying you know that they\u2019re clean and sober to my face but in reality\n\nthey\u2019re lying. I\u2019m done with it.\u201d She claimed that she ended her relationship with father\n\n\u201c[a] few days later after I got the positive drug screen from [the agency].\u201d She admitted\n\nshe was a little fearful that father may hurt her, as \u201che\u2019s made threats to me as well in the\n\npast but nothing you know, physical really. * * * I want to invest in pepper spray just in\n\ncase if something was to happen. I don\u2019t want no firearm, no nothing you know that\n\ncould be potentially dangerous for my children to be in reach of.\u201d When asked about the\n\ngun that father sold, she admitted it was her gun but claimed she did not have much to do\n\nwith it, since she was in Serenity at the time.\n\n       {\u00b6 198} Mother was asked about the foster mom\u2019s testimony that for the last two\n\nvisits, mother and father arrived together; she replied, \u201cNo. The last visit which was on\n\nthe * * * (12th) I was there waiting on [the foster mom.] [Father] wasn\u2019t even there.\n\n[M.M.] asked where her daddy was and I said I didn\u2019t know. About * * * (5) minutes\n\nlater he come walking up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n51.\n\f       {\u00b6 199} Mother was asked about Facebook messenger and text messages between\n\nher and father; she said there were no texts and she messaged him on Facebook to \u201csend\n\nhim odd jobs, that\u2019s it. On Facebook. You know try to help him make money that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nShe did not know the last time she messaged him \u201c[c]ause my phone, I don\u2019t have\n\ninternet so when I get internet, like in Sherwood it spaces out and I something I click one\n\nperson and it pops up another person. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m about to just get rid of the\n\nphone completely and go back to flip phone.\u201d She claimed she did not have internet on\n\nher phone or at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 200} Mother was asked if she married father, as indicated on Facebook, and she\n\nreplied, \u201cNo, absolutely not. * * * At one point we were engaged [in 2017]. The whole\n\nsituation with Facebook and my name. I was illiterate. I\u2019m not going to lie. I could not\n\nfor the life of me figure out how to change my last name back to [her maiden name]. But\n\nthat is my legal name.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 201} Mother claimed the domestic violence committed against her by father in\n\n2018 \u201cwas more verbal. It wasn\u2019t physical.\u201d Father was ordered by the court to have no\n\nviolent or threatening contact with mother and to complete Thinking for a Change, and he\n\nwas placed on probation, which he unsuccessfully completed.\n\n                                           Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 202} At the time of trial, S.O., was in JRC [Juvenile Residential Center] in\n\nBowling Green; mother thought he was charged with \u201crape one * * *. And I don\u2019t know\n\n\n\n\n52.\n\fif it was gross sexual.\u201d She believed the victim lived in the home with S.O. Mother\n\ntalked to S.O. \u201conce a week. I video Zoom him when my internet wants to work once a\n\nweek and I can see him once a week in person.\u201d She did not see S.O. every week\n\n\u201cconsidering it\u2019s an hour away and my funding is kind of short because of everything\n\nright now but I do go see him when I can.\u201d She had not seen S.O. in person for three\n\nweeks.\n\n         {\u00b6 203} Mother stated she had every intention of starting unsupervised visits with\n\nthe children, maybe in October 2022, when T.V. was still alive. She was ready for the\n\nchildren, as \u201cI had the beds made. I had the beds put together. Everything for\n\n[caseworker Alaina] to come check it out to start doing unsupervised visits. I never once\n\ngot an email, call, anything for her to say hey I\u2019m not able to make it to get these\n\nunsupervised visits.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 204} Mother was asked if she picked up father for parenting time, and she said\n\nshe did not and she also did not tell him when the visits were, but \u201c[w]ith my car issues\n\nlike when I go to Bowling Green or even you know, from Sherwood to Bryan I let\n\nsomebody know where I\u2019m going and usually it\u2019s a third party that relays the message to\n\nhim.\u201d\n\n                                         Home Visits\n\n         {\u00b6 205} Testimony was presented that it was sometimes difficult to reach mother,\n\nto which she responded, \u201c[i]n November my grandpa was diagnosed with SCLC which is\n\n\n\n\n53.\n\fsmall cell lung cancer in June of * * * (2022). From that day until December * * * (13th)\n\nthe day that he had passed away, I was his sole provider, caretaker. * * * So like when\n\nthey were to come to the house, I could have very well been in Toledo with my grandpa\n\nfor his [chemo] treatment.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 206} Mother was asked who took care of T.V. while she was in jail for 30 days\n\nin August and September 2022, and she replied, \u201c[m]y mom would come and check in,\n\nyou know every couple days. I talked to him on the phone every day just to make sure,\n\nyou know, he was still okay.\u201d\n\n                                       Employment\n\n       {\u00b6 207} Mother did not have a job, but \u201cI try to do whatever I can, like on the side\n\nas like a gig job just to get extra money.\u201d She helped people with yard pick-up and she\n\nbabysat. Mother\u2019s only health problem was her back, which limited her employment\n\noptions because she could not stand for long periods of time.\n\n                                     Drugs\/Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 208} Mother was questioned about hospital records which indicated B.M.\n\nshowed signs of withdrawal at birth and she tested positive for oxy, meth and amphet, but\n\nshe denied drug use. She said \u201c[t]hey never asked me.\u201d She admitted that she used drugs\n\nduring her pregnancy \u201c[j]ust one time. That was it. One time. * * * And honestly I think\n\nthat\u2019s what put me into labor. Because he wasn\u2019t supposed to be due till actually May * *\n\n* (19th).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n54.\n\f       {\u00b6 209} As to positive drug screens, mother said, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a lot of honesty *\n\n* * throughout this case. I did make a poor choice. * * * I don\u2019t have a desire to even go\n\nback to that [drug use].\u201d She acknowledged she went to Serenity twice for inpatient\n\ntreatment, and went back the second time \u201c[b]ecause I failed another drug screen.\u201d She\n\nsaid the second time was helpful as she was able to work on her mental state to get out of\n\nthe extreme depression and high anxiety that she had.\n\n       {\u00b6 210} Mother claimed she had a rough time with FIC and felt like she went\n\nnowhere, so she failed to complete it.\n\n       {\u00b6 211} Mother called Debbie (father\u2019s mother) in or about April 2023, and asked\n\nfor Narcan for father who was \u201c[n]ot horribly\u201d comatose, as his eyes were open and \u201che\n\ncould walk but not a whole lot.\u201d Mother stated that earlier that day, they went to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201chad a really bad headache and she [Debbie] gave him medicine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was. I don\u2019t know anything because I wasn\u2019t even in that room. * *\n\n* Then we left and later on I called. For Narcan because I don\u2019t know what she gave\n\nhim. Obviously, she\u2019s got Narcan for a reason. Is it something she gave, did she give\n\nhim her medication? * * * I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mother did not call 911, although she drove\n\nfather to the hospital, but he would not get out of the car. Then, they returned to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201cwas completely fine. Like his speech was still a little slurred.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n55.\n\f       {\u00b6 212} Mother admitted she used meth, as \u201cI, you know I have went through\n\ndown a rough path of like emotional distraught, physical, mental and like, I worked my\n\nway out of that to be where I am right now.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 213} Mother also admitted that the agency helped her quite a bit, as the agency\n\nwas \u201cworking with me to try and save my children. The only thing like I get would be\n\nlike the proper housing and more assistance. Like I only get * * * ($23) a month in food\n\nstamps. Half of my check is gone because of my kids, paying for them. How am I\n\nsupposed to even, but I do that\u2019s why I try to get any kind of side job I can make a little\n\nextra money for. And put it towards bills or extra food or something. But I\u2019m going to\n\nreapply for food stamps * * * today. * * * You know I hit up the food banks, I\u2019m not\n\nashamed to hit up you know a food bank.\u201d\n\n                                     Alleged Overdoses\n\n       {\u00b6 214} Regarding the December 2019 incident, mother said she was present, as\n\nwas T.V., S.O., X.H. and M.M. After she found father on the bedroom floor, not\n\nbreathing and blue she \u201cwas on the phone. I had by daughter cause like I was freaking\n\nout. I had my daughter she was screaming in one * * * ear, I was on the phone with 911\n\non the other ear and my grandpa yelled for [S.O.] to come in and help him [with CPR].\u201d\n\nMother said S.O. was traumatized, but \u201cat the same time he was like mom I just saved\n\nsomebody\u2019s life. I\u2019m like, I understand that but I mean you really shouldn\u2019t have to,\n\nyou\u2019re only you know * * * (12) years old. * * * Or younger at the time.\u201d She did not\n\n\n\n\n56.\n\fbelieve that X.H. saw father, as X.H. was in the living room with her. Mother told the\n\npolice that father used heroin in the past. After father was revived, he claimed he was\n\njust sleeping and had a sleeping disorder, which mother said was \u201c[a] little bit of sleep\n\napnea, not like a whole lot.\u201d Mother now believed that father overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 215} As to the January 23, 2023 incident, mother admitted father drank and\n\nwent to the gas station with his cousin and wife. About 15 minutes after they got home,\n\nmother was told to call 911 because father was not breathing. She called 911 and\n\naccused father of overdosing, but she said \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have accused him but I\n\nmean, I didn\u2019t know what else to do or think or say. And it just kind of like, I just\n\nreframed back to before.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 216} Mother claimed the people with father \u201cactually are on medication. There\n\nwere not on anything,\u201d and they did CPR on father, but \u201cno Narcan was used that time.\n\nNothing was.\u201d She believed father told the police that he had epilepsy. Mother honestly\n\ndid not know if the January 2023 incident was an overdose.\n\n                                          Housing\n\n       {\u00b6 217} Mother moved out of T.V.\u2019s home in early February 2023, and admitted\n\nthat she took the appliances because: the washer was old and \u201ccould break down at any\n\ngiven time\u201d; she helped to buy the dryer in 2010; the stove was bought in 2005, so it was\n\nan older appliance; and she paid for most of the refrigerator, which was scratched and\n\ndented and smashed on the one side.\n\n\n\n\n57.\n\f       {\u00b6 218} Mother was asked why she did not correct father\u2019s testimony, given at the\n\nMarch 2023 hearing, that they still lived at T.V.\u2019s home, and she replied, \u201cI, I should\n\nhave, I know. But it was more of like a pride thing. Like I\u2019m here on behalf of my kids I\n\ndon\u2019t want anything more used against me and being in a motel obviously wasn\u2019t a\n\ncredential to have my, get my children back. Cause you know like I don\u2019t want to\n\njeopardize more than what I have already lost. * * * I was kind of like in a stuck\n\nposition.\u201d Mother and father were at the motel for about two months.\n\n       {\u00b6 219} The first week or two of April 2023, mother and father looked for a place\n\nto live, found the Vine trailer online and \u201c[t]he guy was trying to give it away or for it to\n\nbe moved and we talked him into just renting it. * * * Because it was too old to be\n\nmoved.\u201d Mother and father were going to get the Vine trailer together, but they had a big\n\nargument, and he took off so she took it over. Mother produced a copy of the Vine trailer\n\nlease, effective May 1, 2023, which she signed the previous week although the lease was\n\ndated April 7, 2023, \u201cwhen we had started working on it and I had started you know\n\nputting more and more into getting it fixed up.\u201d Mother did not put any money into the\n\nVine trailer as the landlord paid for everything.\n\n       {\u00b6 220} Concerning the Vine trailer, prior to May 1, 2023, mother claimed she\n\npaid a $500 deposit and $500 rent \u201c[b]y saving and doing these odd, odd jobs for people.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged she only received $400 in SSDI.\n\n\n\n\n58.\n\f       {\u00b6 221} Mother was asked about a police report that stated on April 12, 2023,\n\nfather was at the Vine trailer. She claimed she was in Bryan, Ohio at that time and had\n\nno idea that the police were there. She later stated that she called the sheriff, upon advice\n\nof counsel, and the police \u201ctrespassed\u201d father. She said father did not have a key, but\n\n\u201c[t]he back door doesn\u2019t really lock so all you have to do * * * is just turn it, but I fully\n\nintend on getting that fixed. By getting a new door. Like this week.\u201d Mother claimed\n\nthat she did not know father was at the Vine trailer because \u201cwe had no heat there at the\n\ntime. I was hardly there.\u201d Mother did not agree with Tom\u2019s testimony that as of last\n\nweekend, she and father lived together at the Vine trailer, nor did she agree that she and\n\nfather went to the Custer home together, until about a month ago.\n\n       {\u00b6 222} Mother was asked about stable housing and replied, \u201cIt does seem like\n\nyou know, I, I was bouncing around you know for a little bit. But one thing that even\n\nbefore this started, my kids had stability. I had my own place before any of this case\n\neven started. And then I moved in with my grandpa briefly and then I moved to\n\nFreemont, Ohio where I had my own place. I moved back because my grandpa got\n\nlonely. * * * When I got this place in Bryan [the trailer], yea, it took a lot of money * * *\n\nto fix it up. But at the end of the day I still had a home to go to which was my grandpa\u2019s.\n\nThe kids had a home to go to. A safe, proper, suitable home. When he passed away you\n\nknow it interrupted a lot of things in life * * * [a]nd I freaked out. I was staying * * * at a\n\nmotel, * * * [in] the car sometimes you know friends, but you know as of right now I\n\n\n\n\n59.\n\fhave a home. I don\u2019t intend on losing that home.\u201d Mother recognized that the\n\ncaseworker and GAL did not visit the Vine trailer, because they were unaware where she\n\nlived, as she \u201chad just got the place. I wanted to make sure it was up to their * * *\n\nstandards before I contacted anyone.\u201d\n\n                      Juvenile Court\u2019s Finding \u2013 Mother\u2019s Motion\n\n       {\u00b6 223} At the end of the second day of trial, the court denied mother\u2019s motion to\n\nreturn custody of the children to her.\n\n                                GAL Filing - June 2, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 224} Closing Argument\/Proposed Findings of Fact\/Conclusions of Law were\n\nfiled by GAL Cook.\n\n                    Permanent Custody Trial - Day 3, June 5, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 225} Witnesses were called to testify regarding X.H.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 4, June 30, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 226} No witnesses were called to testify. The court addressed the issues\n\nregarding the procedural timetable and the GAL\u2019s lack of adherence to Sup.R. 48, with\n\nrespect to X.H. The court found X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity to be included in the case\n\nplan was insufficient, thus the court denied the permanent custody motion as to X.H. only\n\nand dismissed X.H.\u2019s case.\n\n\n\n\n60.\n\f                                 Permanent Custody Law\n\n       {\u00b6 227} A juvenile court\u2019s decision in a permanent custody case will not be\n\nreversed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In re A.H.,\n\n6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1057, 2011-Ohio-4857, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe underlying rationale of\n\ngiving deference to the findings of the trial court rests with the knowledge that the trial\n\njudge is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice\n\ninflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered\n\ntestimony.\u201d Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273\n\n(1984). Furthermore, \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption must be made in favor of the\n\njudgment and the findings of facts [of the trial court].\u201d Karches v. Cincinnati, 38 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 12, 19, 526 N.E.2d 1350 (1988). Thus, a judgment supported by some competent,\n\ncredible evidence going to all essential elements of the case is not against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence. Id.; C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., 54 Ohio St.2d 279,\n\n376 N.E.2d 578 (1978), syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 228} The juvenile court may grant permanent custody of a child to a children\n\nservices agency if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, two statutory\n\nprongs: (1) the existence of at least one of the four factors set forth in R.C.\n\n2151.414(B)(1)(a) through (d); and (2) the child\u2019s best interest is served by granting\n\npermanent custody to the agency. In re A.H. at \u00b6 12; R.C. 2151.353(A)(4). Clear and\n\nconvincing evidence requires proof which \u201cproduce[s] in the mind of the trier of facts a\n\n\n\n\n61.\n\ffirm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d Cross v. Ledford, 161\n\nOhio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 229} As to the first prong, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) provides that \u201cthe child\n\ncannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be\n\nplaced with either parent.\u201d When making a finding under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), the\n\ncourt must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that only one of the factors\n\nenumerated in R.C. 2151.414(E) exists. In re A.H. at \u00b6 15. Here, the court found R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and those factors are:\n\n       (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and\n\n       notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency\n\n       to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to\n\n       be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and\n\n       repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be\n\n       placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have\n\n       substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental\n\n       utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and\n\n       rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to\n\n       the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to\n\n       resume and maintain parental duties.\n\n\n\n\n62.\n\f      (2) Chronic * * * chemical dependency of the parent that is so severe that it\n\n      makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\n      child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year after the court\n\n      holds the hearing pursuant to division (A) of this section * * *;\n\n      (3) The parent committed any abuse as described in section 2151.031 of the\n\n      Revised Code against the child, caused the child to suffer any neglect as\n\n      described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code, or allowed the child to\n\n      suffer any neglect as described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code\n\n      between the date that the original complaint alleging abuse or neglect was\n\n      filed and the date of the filing of the motion for permanent custody;\n\n      (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by\n\n      failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able\n\n      to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an\n\n      adequate permanent home for the child;\n\n      ***\n\n      (11) The parent has had parental rights involuntarily terminated with\n\n      respect to a sibling of the child pursuant to this section * * * or under an\n\n      existing or former law of * * * any other state * * * that is substantially\n\n      equivalent to those sections, and the parent has failed to provide clear and\n\n      convincing evidence to prove that, notwithstanding the prior termination,\n\n\n\n\n63.\n\f       the parent can provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate\n\n       care for the health, welfare, and safety of the child.\n\n       {\u00b6 230} As to the second prong, the best interest of the child, when making this\n\ndetermination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) provides that the court \u201cshall consider all relevant\n\nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s\n\n       parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and\n\n       any other person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n       the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n       or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n       consecutive twenty-two-month period * * *;\n\n       (d) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent\n\n       custody to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n       apply in relation to the parents and child.\n\n       {\u00b6 231} Here, the court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(11) applied.\n\n\n\n\n64.\n\f                               Juvenile Court\u2019s Judgment\n\n       {\u00b6 232} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court issued its judgment entry, in which it\n\ngranted permanent custody of the children to the agency. The court\u2019s overall findings\n\nand conclusions are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 233} The court detailed the history of the cases, including: father\u2019s alleged\n\noverdose in the presence of mother\u2019s three oldest children, followed by two more alleged\n\noverdoses; B.M.\u2019s premature birth, mother\u2019s positive drug test and her denial of drug use;\n\nthe initial concerns with mother, including illegal drug use, lack of stable housing, mental\n\nhealth issues, an unhealthy and detrimental relationship with father, which issues were\n\nnot satisfactorily resolved, despite numerous services offered to her; father\u2019s failure to\n\nmake substantial progress on any of his case plan goals and his continued use of illegal\n\ndrugs; the parents\u2019 drug use; the parents\u2019 lack of credibility with the agency and the court,\n\nabout their relationship, drug use, housing and more, all to the detriment of the safety and\n\nwell-being of the children, who were young and unable to protect themselves.\n\n       {\u00b6 234} The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the GAL, who\n\nwas appointed at the inception of the cases, testified that the children were of young age\n\nand were bonded with their parents and their foster family, and it was in the best interests\n\nof the children that the motion for permanent custody be granted and mother and father\u2019s\n\nparental rights be terminated. The court found the GAL did not comply, in total, with\n\nSup.R. 48, as reports were not timely filed and certain responsibilities were not fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\n65.\n\fThe court found that while no party objected to or complained about the GAL, it was the\n\ncourt\u2019s responsibility to oversee the GAL. The court found that from the time the\n\ncomplaints were filed through trial, it had regular and frequent contact with mother and\n\nfather, at the hearings where testimony related to the parents and the children, was\n\nreceived, and due to mother\u2019s involvement with FIC. The court found that due to its\n\nfrequent contacts with the parents, significant weight was not given to the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations, thus any deficiencies in the GAL\u2019s performance were harmless. The\n\ncourt found the evidence on which it relied was significant enough to stand alone.\n\nFirst Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 235} The court found, in accordance with R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), the children\n\ncannot or should not be placed with the parents. The court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(1),\n\n(2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n\n(1) the children were placed outside of the home, and notwithstanding reasonable case\n\nplanning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy their problems\n\nwhich caused the children\u2019s removal from the home, each parent failed continuously and\n\nrepeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions which caused the children to be placed\n\noutside of the home; (2) father\u2019s chemical dependency was so severe that he was unable\n\nto provide an adequate permanent home for the children at the present time, and it was\n\nnot anticipated that he could remedy that within one year after the court\u2019s hearing; (3) the\n\nparents allowed the children to suffer abuse and neglect, from the date that the complaints\n\n\n\n\n66.\n\fwere filed through trial; and (4) each parent demonstrated a lack of commitment to the\n\nchildren by showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\nchildren. The court also found father\u2019s parental rights were involuntarily terminated to\n\ntwo half-siblings of the children, and he failed to provide clear and convincing evidence\n\nto prove that, notwithstanding the prior terminations, he could provide a legally secure\n\npermanent placement and adequate care for the health, welfare and safety of the children.\n\nSecond Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 236} The court made the following findings, in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), that: permanent custody was in the best interest of the children, and in\n\ndetermining the best interest of each child, the court considered all credible evidence\n\nrelated to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship of the children with the parents,\n\nsiblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who\n\nmay significantly affect the children; (2) the custodial history of the children, including\n\nwhether the children were in the agency\u2019s temporary custody for 12 or more months in a\n\nconsecutive 22-month period; (3) the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement, and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency; and (4) whether any of the factors in R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) applied; the court found (E)(11) applied, as father had his parental\n\nrights involuntarily terminated to two half-siblings of the children.\n\n\n\n\n67.\n\f       {\u00b6 237} The court further found that the children were placed with a foster family\n\nsince their removal in December 2021, and the foster family wished to adopt the children.\n\nThe evidence showed that the children were doing well in their foster home, and were\n\nstable, safe and meeting their developmental milestones. The children were bonded with\n\nthe parents and foster family, and the children had regular visits with the parents and\n\nX.H. The foster mom testified she and her husband intended to have the children\n\ncontinue their relationship with X.H., and maintain regular contact.\n\n       {\u00b6 238} The court found, in considering all of the best interests factors, there was\n\nclear and convincing evidence presented that the children cannot and should not be\n\nplaced with either parent, and it was in the best interest of each child that permanent\n\ncustody be granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 239} The court ordered mother and father\u2019s parental rights, privileges and\n\nresponsibilities to the children were terminated. The court further ordered that permanent\n\ncustody of the children was granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 240} Mother and father appealed.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s First Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 241} Mother argues the juvenile court abused its discretion when it denied the\n\njoint motion to dismiss. She sets forth two issues:\n\n\n\n\n68.\n\f         Issue One: The trial court erred when it decided that mother failed to\n\n         substantially mitigate or rectify the circumstances which caused the\n\n         children\u2019s removal.\n\n         Issue Two: The motion for permanent custody was filed outside the two-\n\n         year time limit of R.C. 2151.353(G).\n\n                                  Father\u2019s Assignment of Error\n\n         {\u00b6 242} Father argues the juvenile court erred when it granted the motion for\n\npermanent custody because the original complaint had been filed more than two years\n\nprior.\n\n                                         R.C. 2151.353\n\n         {\u00b6 243} R.C. 2151.353(G) states:\n\n         Any temporary custody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier\n\n         of the date on which the complaint in the case was filed or the child was\n\n         first placed into shelter care, except that, upon the filing of a motion\n\n         pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the temporary custody\n\n         order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a dispositional\n\n         order under that section. In resolving the motion, the court shall not order\n\n         an existing temporary custody order to continue beyond two years after the\n\n         date on which the complaint was filed or the child was first placed into\n\n         shelter care, whichever date is earlier * * *.\n\n\n\n\n69.\n\f              Judgment Entry - Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 244} The juvenile court denied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss the motion\n\npermanent custody filed by the agency. The court\u2019s findings are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 245} The court found that mother and father have a significant drug history, as\n\nevidenced throughout the pendency of the cases where they struggled with substance\n\nabuse and had positive drug screens. The court found \u201c[t]he parties have been less than\n\nhonest with the Court and with the Agency,\u201d and their \u201ccredibility was compromised\n\nthrough statements that they made in their testimony concerning their use of illegal\n\nsubstances, their relationship with each other and whether they resided together, and for\n\nextensive periods of time one or both evaded the Agency.\u201d The court stressed \u201c[t]he\n\ncompromise of their credibility is taken as a significant factor in this Decision.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 246} The court cited R.C. 2151.353(G), and observed the parents argued the\n\nagency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed outside of the time frame prescribed by\n\nstatute, and should be dismissed and the children returned to the parents. The court\n\ndeclined to address the issue, as it was not \u201ccentral to this Motion due to Ohio case law.\u201d\n\nThe court referred to In re Young Children, 76 Ohio St.3d 632, 638, 669 N.E.2d 1140\n\n(1996), and noted parents\u2019 counsel \u201call agree[d] and acknowledge[d]\u201d the case which\n\nheld that \u201calthough the Agency filed its Motion for Permanent Custody outside the\n\nstatutory guidelines, the Court can make dispositional orders relating to the children if the\n\n\n\n\n70.\n\foriginal problems that were present at the time of the filing of the complaints have not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 247} The court found \u201c[d]uring the pendency of this case, both [parents] were\n\nheld in contempt for failing to comply with the Court\u2019s Order adopting the case plan. The\n\nbasis of both parents\u2019 contempt was that they failed to follow the treatment\n\nrecommendations of their individual providers.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 248} The court concluded the original facts which led to the filing of the\n\ncomplaints were not mitigated, because mother continued her relationship with father and\n\nlived with him. As such, the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions\n\nimpacted on each other. The court found it retained jurisdiction, and denied the parents\u2019\n\nmotion.\n\n                            Mother and Father\u2019s Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 249} We will first address portions of Issue One and all of Issue Two, along\n\nwith father\u2019s assignment of error, as similar arguments are presented.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Relevant Arguments and Issue Two\n\n       {\u00b6 250} Mother offers a timeline of the children\u2019s cases: July 13, 2020, complaints\n\nfiled; December 30, 2021, the children removed; January 31, 2022, mother consented to\n\nagency\u2019s temporary custody; December 30, 2022, agency filed motion to return the\n\nchildren to mother, within R.C. 2151.414(A) time period; and January 31, 2023, agency\n\nfiled for permanent custody, outside of R.C. 2151.414(A) time period.\n\n\n\n\n71.\n\f        {\u00b6 251} Mother argues the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed\n\noutside of the two-year time limit in R.C. 2151.353(G). She contends temporary custody\n\nwas granted on January 31, 2022, but the agency filed no motions until December 30,\n\n2022, when the agency filed to return the children or extend temporary custody. Mother\n\nasserts this is outside of the two-year deadline from the date the complaints were filed in\n\nJuly 2020, thus the juvenile court erred when it denied mother\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n        {\u00b6 252} Mother submits that no matter when the clock started ticking, with the\n\nfiling of the complaints or when the agency was granted temporary custody, the agency\n\ndid not file for permanent custody within the one year \u201csunset date,\u201d in R.C.\n\n2151.353(G). She also claims the agency did not file its motion for permanent custody\n\none month prior to the termination of the temporary custody order, pursuant to R.C.\n\n2141.415(A).\n\n        {\u00b6 253} Father argues the two-year deadline in R.C. 2151.415(D)(4) is steadfast\n\nand has been applied by courts as a definite deadline. He cites to In re L.B., 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 112407, 2023-Ohio-2392. Father contends he filed a motion to dismiss\n\nthe cases because the complaints were filed more than two years prior, on July 13, 2020,\n\nand the motion for permanent custody was filed January 30, 2023. He claims \u201c[i]t is\n\ncommon knowledge that two years equals 730 days, and here, 931 days had passed.\n\nFather submits the agency allowed more 200 days to elapse before filing, which is too\n\nlate.\n\n\n\n\n72.\n\f                                    Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 254} An abuse of discretion indicates the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable,\n\narbitrary or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d\n\n1140 (1983).\n\n                                       Law and Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 255} The parents argue the juvenile court erred when it did not grant the joint\n\nmotion to dismiss, based on the untimely motion for permanent custody filed by the\n\nagency.\n\n       {\u00b6 256} In reaching its judgment entry denying the joint motion to dismiss, the\n\njuvenile court relied on In re Young, 76 Ohio St.3d 632, 669 N.E.2d 1140. In that case,\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio held \u201cthe passing of the sunset date pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.353(F)5 does not divest juvenile courts of jurisdiction to enter dispositional orders.\u201d\n\nId. at 637. The court further found:\n\n               The obligation to file a motion [for permanent custody] thirty days\n\n       prior to the sunset date is not vitiated and the failure to file is not harmless\n\n       error. * * * Accordingly, although the court has continuing jurisdiction,\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The version of R.C. 2151.353(F) in effect at that time, provided: Any temporary\ncustody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier of the date on which the\ncomplaint in the case was filed or the child was first placed into shelter care, except that,\nupon the filing of a motion pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the\ntemporary custody order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a\ndispositional order under that section.\n\n\n\n73.\n\f       temporary custody terminates when the sunset date passes without a filing\n\n       pursuant to R.C. 2151.415(A). However, because the court retains\n\n       jurisdiction over the child, it may make further dispositional orders as it\n\n       deems necessary to protect the child. * * *\n\n              This holding allows the juvenile court to assess each situation on its\n\n       merits and does not mandate the return of children to a situation from\n\n       which they originally needed protection solely because the agency charged\n\n       with their care missed a filing deadline. Thus, we hold that when the sunset\n\n       date has passed without a filing pursuant to R.C. 2151.415 and the\n\n       problems that led to the original grant of temporary custody have not been\n\n       resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts have the discretion to make a\n\n       dispositional order in the best interests of the child. Where the original\n\n       problems have been resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts may not make\n\n       further dispositional orders based on the original complaint. Id. at 638.\n\n       {\u00b6 257} We find, in accordance with the In re Young decision, the juvenile court\n\nhad the authority to exercise its discretion, after the sunset date, to make a dispositional\n\norder in the best interests of the children upon finding that the parents had not remedied\n\nthe problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody.\n\n\n\n\n74.\n\f       {\u00b6 258} We now turn to the remaining arguments in mother\u2019s Issue One, that the\n\njuvenile court erred when it found she had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated her\n\noriginal problems.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Remaining Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 259} Mother argues the evidence shows that she sufficiently mitigated her\n\nproblems, as the agency was ready to return the children to her in December 2021, prior\n\nto the grant of temporary custody. However, because she tested positive for meth on\n\nDecember 8 and 10, 2021, an emergency custody hearing was held on December 30,\n\n2021, \u201c[y]et [the agency] still considered her \u2018compliant\u2019 with all [of] the rest of the case\n\nplan, and noted that the previous eight random drug screens were negative.\u201d (Emphasis\n\nsic.) Shortly thereafter, the court granted temporary custody of the children to the\n\nagency.\n\n       {\u00b6 260} Mother asserts \u201c[t]he parties kept arguing that the \u2018sufficiently mitigated\u2019\n\ntest was to look at the conditions alleged in the original complaint[s],\u201d which \u201callowed\n\nthe court to examine whether [father] had sufficiently mitigated because allegations were\n\nmade regarding his drug use in [the] complaint[s].\u201d But mother claims \u201cas happened in *\n\n* * In re Young * * * a new complaint for temporary custody was filed in December\n\n2021, which as in In re Young, \u2018established its own sunset date because it was based on\n\nfacts learned subsequent to the filing of the original complaint.\u2019 Id. at 638-639.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n75.\n\f       {\u00b6 261} Mother contends the juvenile court \u201cmust have examined the conditions\n\nwhich led to [the agency\u2019s] filing for temporary custody,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen temporary\n\ncustody was granted, [father] was no longer on a case plan * * * [so] his conditions\n\nshould not have been examined under the [sufficiently mitigated] Young test.\u201d She insists\n\nthe juvenile court should have only considered her two positive meth screens, her\n\nsubsequent eight negative screens and her successful completion of inpatient treatment\n\nfor the second time. She claims, taking the case history as a whole, she showed she \u201cwas\n\nsuccessfully in recovery and was committed to being sober and continuing supportive\n\ntreatment.\u201d\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 262} Upon review, we find that, pursuant to In re Young, the juvenile court\n\nproperly exercised its discretion by making a dispositional order in the children\u2019s best\n\ninterests, when the evidence in the record clearly supported its ruling that mother and\n\nfather\u2019s original problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody, had not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated after the sunset date had passed.\n\n       {\u00b6 263} Mother\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included: struggling with illegal drug use, she tested positive for\n\nmeth twice the month prior; continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user;\n\nand not being truthful or cooperative, as she repeatedly denied using drugs and denied\n\n\n\n\n76.\n\fbeing in a relationship with father. At the time the sunset date passed, mother had not\n\nresolved or sufficiently mitigated her problem with drugs, lying and father.\n\n         {\u00b6 264} Father\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included repeated use of illegal drugs, positive drug screens and not\n\nbeing truthful or cooperative with the agency or court. At the time that the sunset date\n\npassed, father had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated his problem with drugs and\n\nlying.\n\n         {\u00b6 265} We find no abuse of discretion by the juvenile court. Accordingly, we\n\nfind mother\u2019s first assignment of error not well-taken and father\u2019s sole assignment not\n\nwell-taken.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\nMother\u2019s Arguments\n\n         {\u00b6 266} Mother argues the juvenile court erred by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. She notes the court, in its final judgment entry, stated\n\nit did not place significant weight on the GAL\u2019s report, and that any deficiencies in the\n\nGAL\u2019s performance were harmless. Mother asserts the GAL\u2019s report concerned X.H.,\n\nnot the children, thus she \u201cwas severely prejudiced by being unaware of the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations and reasons for [the children] before the hearing.\u201d She further argues\n\nthe GAL\u2019s testimony in lieu of a report was minimal and, as the trial court found, done in\n\nnear-complete failure to observe the requirements of the GAL report and [Sup.R.] 48.\n\n\n\n\n77.\n\f       {\u00b6 267} Mother contends \u201c[t]he GAL\u2019s complete failure to file a report on [the]\n\nchildren, or adequately investigate the children and [mother], should have warranted\n\ndismissal of the matter as to [the children]. She claims \u201c[i]f the errors were fatal to the\n\ncase as to X.H., then the errors should be found even more fatal here.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 268} Mother submits that \u201c[p]ermitting or not striking the GAL\u2019s testimony\n\nregarding [the] two children constitutes plain error.\u201d She maintains \u201cthe GAL\u2019s oral\n\nreport, which he stated was in lieu of a written report, was deficient and non-compliant\n\nwith Sup.R. 48 and the Williams County local rules. This is not harmless error as the\n\ntrial court found.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 269} In support, she cites to In re A.S., 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 21AP-249,\n\n21AP-259, 2022-Ohio-1861, where the parent, at the permanent custody trial, failed to\n\nobject to the admission of the GAL\u2019s testimony and report, thus the plain error standard\n\nof review applied when considering whether the juvenile court erred by failing to remove\n\nthe GAL and by admitting the GAL\u2019s testimony. Id. at \u00b6 54. Mother requests the\n\njuvenile court\u2019s judgment be reversed, based on plain error.\n\nState\u2019s Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 270} The state argues the children\u2019s cases are similar to In re T.C., 6th Dist.\n\nLucas No. L-15-1106, 2015-Ohio-3665, \u00b6 21-22, which was recently cited in Short v.\n\nRhodes, 2021-Ohio-1845, 173 N.E.3d 806 (6th Dist.) and In re A.D., 2023-Ohio-2442,\n\n221 N.E.3d 259 (3d Dist.).\n\n\n\n\n78.\n\f                                             Law\n\nPlain Error\n\n       {\u00b6 271} \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the\n\nextremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no\n\nobjection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the\n\nunderlying judicial process itself.\u201d Goldfuss v. Davidson, 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d\n\n1099 (1997), syllabus. Further, \u201c[i]n applying the doctrine of plain error in a civil case,\n\nreviewing courts must proceed with the utmost caution, limiting the doctrine strictly to\n\nthose extremely rare cases where exceptional circumstances require its application to\n\nprevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 121.

This court noted \u201c[t]he purpose of appointing a [GAL] in a\n\nparental rights allocation proceeding is \u2018to provide the court with relevant information\n\nand an informed recommendation regarding the child\u2019s best interest.\u2019 Sup.R. 48(D).\n\nRules of superintendence are not, however, \u2018the equivalent of rules of procedure and have\n\nno force equivalent to a statute.\u2019 * * * They are \u2018internal housekeeping rules which are of\n\nconcern to the judges of the several courts but create no rights in individual[s].\u2019\u201d\n\n(Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 21.\n\n       {\u00b6 275} \u201cThis court has interpreted Sup.R. 48(D) as a general guideline for the\n\nconduct of courts. See In re E.S., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT-14-008, 2014-Ohio-3067, \u00b6\n\n64 (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the [GAL]\u2019s\n\ntestimony and report even though appellant complained that the guardian failed to\n\ncomply with Sup.R. 48(D)).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. \u201cFurther, the trial court, as trier of fact, is\n\n\n\n\n80.\n\fpermitted to assign weight to the [GAL]\u2019s testimony and recommendation and to consider\n\nit in the context of all the evidence before the court.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 276} A review of the record shows the juvenile court understood the GAL\u2019s\n\nshort-comings, observed the GAL did not comply with all of the requirements of Sup.R.\n\n48, with respect to the timely filing of reports and performing certain duties, and\n\nappreciated it was the court\u2019s responsibility to oversee the GAL.\n\n       {\u00b6 277} The court described its active involvement in the cases from the time the\n\ncomplaints were filed until trial, noting it had regular and frequent contact with the\n\nparents at the multiple hearings, where testimony related to the parents and the children\n\nwas received. The court had additional contact with mother when she was a participant\n\nin FIC. The court recognized that due to its repeated contacts with the parents, it did not\n\ngive significant weight to the GAL\u2019s recommendations, as the evidence on which it relied\n\nwas significant enough to stand alone.\n\n       {\u00b6 278} The record further reveals that during the time that the children\u2019s cases\n\nwere pending, GAL Cook filed seven reports and after the first day of trial, he filed\n\nClosing Argument\/Proposed Findings of Fact\/Conclusions of Law. The record also\n\nshows that throughout the cases, five agency employees worked on the cases at various\n\ntimes. The employees reported their dealings with the children and parents to the court,\n\nand some of the employees also shared their opinions and beliefs concerning the\n\n\n\n\n81.\n\fchildren\u2019s best interest. In addition, the children\u2019s foster mom provided the court with\n\ninformation concerning the children, their well-being and their visits with the parents, and\n\nshe shared what she thought was in the children\u2019s best interests.\n\n       {\u00b6 279} Given the applicable law, and the state of the record including the ample\n\nevidence regarding the children\u2019s best interests, exclusive of the GAL\u2019s trial testimony,\n\nwe find the juvenile court did not commit plain error by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. Moreover, we find the dismissal of X.H.\u2019s case does\n\nnot in any way affect the children\u2019s cases or warrant the dismissal of the children\u2019s cases,\n\nas X.H.\u2019s case was dismissed because the juvenile found that X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity\n\nto be included in the case plan for X.H. was insufficient.\n\n       {\u00b6 280} Accordingly, mother\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                               Third Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 281} Mother argues \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and\n\nfinding that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.\u201d She contends she substantially remedied the conditions which\n\ncaused the children to be placed outside of the home, but emergency custody was granted\n\nbased on her two out of ten positive drug screens in one month. She claims she \u201chad\n\nbeen sober for almost one year and had completed the case plan at the time of trial,\u201d and\n\nbut for being with father, the children would have been returned to her.\n\n\n\n\n82.\n\f       {\u00b6 282} Mother asserts \u201cshe did not allow the children to suffer abuse and neglect\n\nsince the filing of the complaint and motion for permanent custody, as \u201cthe caseworkers\n\ntestified that [mother] was bonded to the children and visitations were going very well.\u201d\n\nYet, \u201cthe trial court found that her \u2018continued use of illegal drugs\u2019 and the two inpatient\n\ntreatment stints constituted neglect.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) This is irrational and unreasonable,\n\nshe argues, since the court ordered her to \u201cperform both inpatient treatments; to have the\n\ntrial court\u2019s orders warrant a finding of neglect is an abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 283} Mother maintains that she showed commitment and a willingness to\n\nprovide a permanent home, and at the time of trial, \u201cshe had obtained new housing and\n\nsubmitted evidence that the home was appropriate and safe.\u201d She claims she was no\n\nlonger with father \u201cand the court should have found that she was no longer living with\n\nhim * * * [and her] parental rights should not hinge upon whether [he] could follow a\n\ncase plan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 284} Mother argues as to \u201cthe children\u2019s best interests: the GAL\u2019s deficiencies\n\nand total lack of a report render the GAL\u2019s opinion on this point useless; however, the\n\nGAL did testify that \u2018absolutely\u2019 there was a detriment to the children in severing their\n\nbond with [mother].\u201d Mother \u201crequests this Court review the statutory best interest\n\nfactors and find that permanent custody is not in the children\u2019s interest, as their mother\n\nhad made a permanent and appropriate home and had rectified the conditions that led to\n\nremoval.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n83.\n\f                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 285} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court filed a 17-page judgment entry in\n\nwhich it granted permanent custody of the children to the agency, and terminated mother\n\nand father\u2019s parental rights to the children. In so ruling, the court summarized the\n\nextensive evidence presented, cited to and relied upon the applicable law, indicated which\n\nfactors it considered and offered well-reasoned explanations for the decision it rendered.\n\nFirst Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 286} We have carefully reviewed the record, which we conclude contains clear\n\nand convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that the children cannot\n\nand should not be placed with either mother or father, as both parents repeatedly and\n\ncontinuously failed to remedy the conditions which caused the children\u2019s removal from\n\nthe home, despite reasonable case planning, a multitude of case plan services and diligent\n\nefforts by the agency offered to assist the parents to remedy their problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 287} Throughout the agency\u2019s involvement with the family, the main concerns\n\nwere the parents\u2019 drug use, relationship and housing. Both parents used illegal drugs,\n\nwhich was confirmed by countless positive drug screens, yet both denied drug use for the\n\nmajority of the cases. The court ordered mother and father to partake in drug treatment\n\nprograms, yet drug use continued; father used regularly, mother used more sporadically.\n\nThe parents\u2019 relationship was concerning, largely due to their drug use. By the parents\u2019\n\naccounts, their relationship was on and off, however, since the parents were often not\n\n\n\n\n84.\n\fhonest with the court or the agency, which was revealed in their jail communications and\n\ninconsistent statements and testimony, the status of their relationship was not always\n\nknown. Housing was a concern as it was rarely stable and appropriate, because mother\n\nand the children frequently moved between the trailer and T.V.\u2019s home and father moved,\n\nsometimes with the children, from trailers, to relatives, to Kentucky and to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\nIt was never really known when the parents lived together, as they were not always\n\nhonest and forthcoming with the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 288} We further conclude that clear and convincing evidence in the record\n\nsupports the juvenile court\u2019s findings that both parents exhibited a lack of commitment to\n\nthe children due to their unwillingness to provide an adequate, permanent home for the\n\nchildren, due to father repeatedly failing and\/or refusing to engage in substance abuse\n\ntreatment and other case plan requirements, and due to mother repeatedly choosing her\n\nrelationship with father over the needs and safety of the children. Mother was constantly\n\nadvised that the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions impacted on each\n\nother, and that reunification could only occur if she ended her relationship with father.\n\nTime and again mother said she understood, but chose father and prioritized him over the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b6 289} Although mother successfully completed many of her case plan services,\n\nshe failed to change her behaviors; she still used illegal drugs on occasion and continued\n\nher relationship with father. She also defied court orders, was found in contempt of court\n\n\n\n\n85.\n\fand was jailed. Same with father. Thus, the original conditions which led to the filing of\n\nthe complaints, continued to the detriment of the children.\n\nSecond Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 290} We have thoroughly reviewed the record, and we conclude it contains\n\nclear and convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that it was in the\n\nchildren\u2019s best interests for permanent custody to be awarded to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 291} The record shows the juvenile court considered the interaction and\n\nrelationships of the children with mother, father, caregivers and relatives, the children\u2019s\n\ncustodial history and the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement.\n\n       {\u00b6 292} The record further reveals that since the children were removed from the\n\nhome in December 2021, they have been with the same foster family and were stable,\n\nsafe and doing well. The children, who were bonded with the parents and foster family,\n\nhad regular visits with the parents and X.H., which were supervised by the foster mom.\n\nThe foster parents wished to adopt the children, and intended to continue the children\u2019s\n\nrelationship with X.H.\n\n       {\u00b6 293} Based on the foregoing and the abundance of evidence in the record,\n\nincluding the agency\u2019s numerous reports and the GAL reports, we find mother\u2019s third\n\nassignment of error not-well taken.\n\n\n\n\n86.\n\f       {\u00b6 294} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Williams County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.

Meeks appeals the judgment of the Williams County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, convicting him following his guilty plea to five sexual offenses\n\ninvolving minors and sentencing him to an indefinite term of six to nine years in prison.\n\nFor the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\f                    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} On November 9, 2021, the Williams County Grand Jury returned a 31-count\n\nindictment against Meeks, charging him with one count of importuning in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.07(D)(2) and (F)(3),1 a felony of the fifth degree; one count of pandering\n\nobscenity involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(1) and (C), a felony of the\n\nsecond degree; 20 counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) and (C), felonies of the second degree; and nine counts\n\nof illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1)\n\nand (B), felonies of the second degree. The charges stemmed from Meeks\u2019 online\n\nconduct in soliciting and possessing child pornography.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On November 14, 2022, Meeks entered a guilty plea to the count of\n\nimportuning in violation of R.C. 2907.07(D)(2) and (F)(3), a felony of the fifth degree;\n\nthe count of pandering obscenity involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(1)\n\nand (C), a felony of the second degree; and three amended counts of pandering sexually\n\noriented matter involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), felonies of the\n\nfourth degree. The trial court accepted Meeks\u2019 plea, found him guilty, and continued the\n\nmatter for preparation of a presentence investigation report.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court heard statements in mitigation from\n\nMeeks and his counsel. Meeks accepted responsibility for his conduct and expressed\n\n\n1\n  R.C. 2907.07 was amended effective April 4, 2023. The citations in this case refer to\nthe prior version in effect at the time of Meeks\u2019 offense.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fremorse, stating that it occurred during a dark time in his life. He promised that it would\n\nnever happen again. He also noted that he has no felony criminal record and no\n\nsubstance abuse issues, but he recognizes his need for mental health services. Finally, he\n\nstated that he has family support and the ability to sustain gainful employment.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Thereafter, upon consideration of the record, the statements in mitigation,\n\nand the principles and purposes of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and\n\nrecidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12, the trial court sentenced Meeks to serve 11 months in\n\nprison on the count of importuning, six to nine years in prison on the count of pandering\n\nobscenity involving a minor, and 17 months in prison on each of the three amended\n\ncounts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor. The trial court further\n\nordered the prison terms to be served concurrently, for a total indefinite prison term of six\n\nto nine years.\n\n                                   II. Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 6} Meeks timely appealed his judgment of conviction and asserts one\n\nassignment of error for review:\n\n                 1. Mr. Meeks\u2019 sentence is not contrary to law, but it is clearly and\n\n       convincingly not supported by the record.\n\n                                          III. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Felony sentences are reviewed pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), which\n\nprovides, in pertinent part,\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\f              The appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a\n\n       sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and\n\n       remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing. The appellate\n\n       court\u2019s standard for review is not whether the sentencing court abused its\n\n       discretion. The appellate court may take any action authorized by this\n\n       division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of the following:\n\n              (a) That the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings\n\n       under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of\n\n       section 2929.14, or division (I) of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code,\n\n       whichever, if any, is relevant;\n\n              (b) That the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Here, none of the findings under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) are applicable; thus,\n\nMeeks must demonstrate that his sentence is \u201cotherwise contrary to law\u201d under R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(b). \u201cContrary to law\u201d means \u201c\u2018in violation of statute or legal regulations\n\nat a given time.\u2019\u201d State v. Goode, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-22-012, 2023-Ohio-863, \u00b6 6,\n\nquoting State v. Jones, 163 Ohio St.3d 242, 2020-Ohio-6729, 169 N.E.3d 649, \u00b6 34; see\n\nalso State v. Bryant, 168 Ohio St.3d 250, 2022-Ohio-1878, 198 N.E.3d 68, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Meeks, however, acknowledges that his sentence is not contrary to law.\n\nInstead, he argues that his sentence is too lengthy in light of the record and the statutory\n\nguidelines. Specifically, Meeks cites the factors under R.C. 2929.12(B) and (C)\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fdemonstrating that his conduct is \u201cless serious,\u201d not \u201cmore serious.\u201d He also cites the\n\nfactors under R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E) demonstrating that he is less likely, not more\n\nlikely, to commit future offenses. Thus, he asks this court to reconsider his sentence and\n\nimpose community control or a shorter prison term.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Meeks requests relief that the statute does not provide. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)\n\n\u201cdoes not permit an appellate court to conduct an independent review of a trial court\u2019s\n\nsentencing findings under R.C. 2929.12 or its adherence to the purposes of felony\n\nsentencing under R.C. 2929.11\u201d State v. Reynolds, 6th Dist. Sandusky Nos. S-22-022, S-\n\n22-023, 2023-Ohio-2624, \u00b6 10, quoting Bryant at \u00b6 21; see also Jones at \u00b6 41-42. Thus,\n\nthis court cannot review the trial court\u2019s finding and weighing of those factors, and his\n\nassignment of error on this issue may be summarily denied. State v. Bowles, 2021-Ohio-\n\n4401, 181 N.E.3d 1226, \u00b6 8, 10 (6th Dist.), citing State v.

Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 12} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Williams County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas is affirmed.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                 I. Background and Facts\n\n       {\u00b6 2} Eames was indicted in two separate cases on a total of 33 charges. In case\n\nNo. 2022CR0045 (\u201ccase 1\u201d), Eames was charged with one count of grand theft in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(4), a third-degree felony; seven counts of petty\n\ntheft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree misdemeanor;\n\nseven counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a fifth-degree\n\nfelony; and ten counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a fifth-\n\ndegree felony. In case No. 2022CR0046 (\u201ccase 2\u201d), Eames was charged with two counts\n\nof petty theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree\n\nmisdemeanor; three counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a\n\nfifth-degree felony; and three counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and\n\n(B)(2), each a fifth-degree felony.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Eames and the state reached an agreement under which Eames agreed to\n\nplead guilty to 32 of the original charges and pay restitution, and the state agreed to\n\ndismiss the grand theft charge and not oppose Eames\u2019s request for intervention in lieu of\n\nconviction (\u201cILC\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In August 2022, Eames pleaded guilty in both cases. As part of his pleas,\n\nEames agreed to pay 16 of his 23 victims a total of $8,309.55 in restitution, jointly and\n\nseverally with his codefendant. In case 1, he agreed to pay $5,247.62 to 12 victims; in\n\ncase 2, he agreed to pay $3,061.93 to four victims. The trial court accepted Eames\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fpleas, found that Eames was eligible for ILC and willing to comply with the conditions of\n\nan intervention plan, placed him under the supervision of the probation department for\n\none year, stayed all criminal proceedings against him, and imposed conditions of\n\nsupervision. Among the conditions of his intervention plans were requirements that he\n\npay total restitution of $5,247.62 in case 1 and $3,061.93 in case 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In April 2023, following two ILC violations that Eames stipulated to, the\n\ntrial court terminated Eames\u2019s ILC. At the hearing, after considering Eames\u2019s behavior\n\nwhile on ILC, along with the principles and purposes of sentencing and the applicable\n\nseriousness and recidivism factors, the court terminated Eames\u2019s term of ILC and found\n\nhim guilty of the 32 charges he pleaded to in August 2022. In case 1, the court imposed\n\nprison terms of six months on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and\n\nten months on each identity fraud count. In case 2, the court imposed prison terms of six\n\nmonths on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and ten months on each\n\nidentity fraud count. The court ordered all of the sentences to run concurrently, for an\n\naggregate sentence of ten months. The court also ordered Eames to pay restitution of\n\n$3,061.93 in case 2 and \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} The trial court\u2019s sentencing entries generally reflected its actions at the\n\nsentencing hearing. However, in the entry for case 1, the trial court ordered Eames to pay\n\n$5,247.62 in restitution. This is the amount in the plea agreement and judgment entry\n\ngranting Eames\u2019s request for ILC, but is not \u201cthe same amount\u201d as case 2, as the court\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fordered at the sentencing hearing. The entry for case 2 included an order to pay\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Eames now appeals, raising two assignments of error:\n\n              I. The trial court abused its discretion in sentencing Appellant to a\n\n       prison term which was not supported by the record which is an abuse of\n\n       discretion and plain error.\n\n              II. The trial court erred when it ordered the payment of restitution.\n\n                                     II. Law and Analysis\n\nA. We cannot review the trial court\u2019s application of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and\n                                     2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion and committed plain error by sentencing him to ten months in prison because\n\n\u201cthe record does not support the severity of the sentence imposed[,]\u201d which shows that\n\nthe court did not properly consider the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. In response,\n\nthe state points out that we are precluded by State v. Jones, 163 Ohio St.3d 242, 2020-\n\nOhio-6729, 169 N.E.3d 649, from reviewing the trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C.\n\n2929.11 and 2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Generally, we review sentencing challenges under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). The\n\nstatute allows us to increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence or vacate the\n\nsentence and remand the matter for resentencing only if we clearly and convincingly find\n\neither (1) the record does not support the trial court\u2019s findings under specified Revised\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fCode sections not at issue here, or (2) the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(a)-(b). Notably, under the statute, \u201c[t]he appellate court\u2019s standard for\n\nreview is not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n\n       {\u00b6 10} However, since the Ohio Supreme Court decided Jones, the law governing\n\nappellate review of a trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 in imposing\n\nsentence is clear: \u201cR.C. 2953.08(G)(2) does not permit an \u2018appellate court to\n\nindependently weigh the evidence in the record and substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrial court concerning the sentence that best reflects compliance with R.C. 2929.11 and\n\n2929.12.\u2019\u201d State v. Bowles, 2021-Ohio-4401, 181 N.E.3d. 1226, \u00b6 7 (6th Dist.), quoting\n\nJones at \u00b6 42; see also, e.g., State v. Johnson, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-20-056, 2021-\n\nOhio-2139, \u00b6 14, citing State v. Orzechowski, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-20-029, 2021-\n\nOhio-985, \u00b6 10; State v. Woodmore, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-20-1088, 2021-Ohio-1677, \u00b6\n\n17. Moreover, we may summarily dispose of an assignment of error that is based only on\n\nthe trial court\u2019s consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. See Bowles at\n\n\u00b6 8, citing State v. Toles, 166 Ohio St.3d 397, 2021-Ohio-3531, 186 N.E.3d 784, \u00b6 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Eames\u2019s only arguments under this assignment of error relate to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, which we cannot\n\nreview. Accordingly, based on the authority of Jones and Toles, we summarily find that\n\nEames\u2019s first assignment of error in not well-taken. Bowles at \u00b6 9, citing Toles at \u00b6 11\n\n(Brunner, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       B. The restitution amounts in the sentencing entries are not reversible.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} In his second assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court erred\n\nwhen it ordered him to pay restitution because the amount of restitution that it ordered at\n\nthe sentencing hearing was not the same as the amount it put in the sentencing entries,\n\nand the court did not consider his ability to pay restitution.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The state responds that Eames is barred by R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) from\n\nappealing the restitution order because he stipulated to the amount of restitution when he\n\npleaded guilty and the amount of restitution was included in the plea agreement that he\n\nsigned. It contends that a trial court is not required to state the amount of stipulated\n\nrestitution in open court for the order to be valid, and the court put the correct amounts in\n\nits sentencing entries, which is what matters. It also argues that the trial court is not\n\nrequired to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution when the defendant agrees to\n\nthe amount of restitution.\n\n               1. We can consider the merits of this assignment of error.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} First, we address the state\u2019s argument that Eames\u2019s appeal is precluded by\n\nR.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Our general ability to review a felony sentence is eliminated when\n\nthe defendant and prosecutor jointly recommend a sentence, the sentencing judge\n\nimposes the recommended sentence, and the sentence is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d R.C.\n\n2953.08(D)(1). \u201cA sentence is \u2018authorized by law\u2019 and is not appealable within the\n\nmeaning of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) only if it comports with all mandatory sentencing\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fprovisions.\u201d State v. Underwood, 124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923,\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus. Under R.C. 2929.18(A), a sentencing court\u2019s decision to\n\norder restitution is discretionary. State v. Lalain, 136 Ohio St.3d 248, 2013-Ohio-3093,\n\n994 N.E.2d 423, \u00b6 23. But, if the court chooses to impose that sanction, R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1) contains mandatory provisions that the court must follow. State v. Brant,\n\n6th Dist. Huron No. H-15-013, 2016-Ohio-5274, \u00b6 18, citing State v. Burns, 2012-Ohio-\n\n4191, 976 N.E.2d 969, \u00b6 19 (6th Dist.). Among those mandatory provisions are ordering\n\nrestitution in open court and determining the amount of restitution at sentencing. R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Additionally, although not specifically related to restitution, Crim.R.\n\n43(A)(1) requires a defendant to be physically present (unless appropriate arrangements\n\nare made for the defendant to appear by video) at every stage of a criminal proceeding,\n\nincluding the imposition or modification of sentence. Thus, a trial court is not permitted\n\nto impose a sentence in its sentencing entry that it did not also impose at the sentencing\n\nhearing. State v. Lantz, 6th Dist. Fulton No. F-18-011, 2019-Ohio-3307, \u00b6 8; State v.\n\nVaughn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103330, 2016-Ohio-3320, \u00b6 18.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} In this case, the trial court technically complied with the requirements of\n\nR.C. 2929.18(A)(1) by ordering Eames to pay restitution in open court, ordering\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93 in case 2, and ordering restitution of \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case\n\n1. However, the court ultimately imposed a different, higher amount of restitution in the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fsentencing entry for case 1, and nothing in the record indicates that the trial court altered\n\nthe restitution amount in Eames\u2019s presence. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s\n\nrestitution order \u201ccomports with all mandatory sentencing provisions[,]\u201d so it is not\n\n\u201cauthorized by law,\u201d as required to bar an appeal under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Underwood\n\nat paragraph two of the syllabus. Accordingly, the state\u2019s argument is unavailing, and we\n\ncan consider the merits of Eames\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n                         2. The trial court\u2019s error was harmless.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Turning to the merits of Eames\u2019s arguments, we find no errors in the\n\nrestitution order in case 2. The court ordered $3,061.93 in restitution for case 2 at the\n\nsentencing hearing and included the same amount in its sentencing judgment entry.\n\nEames does not raise any arguments that this was somehow improper, other than\n\nsummarily saying that the trial court\u2019s announcement of a lower restitution amount in\n\ncase 1 in open court \u201cvoid[ed] both\u201d restitution orders. This argument is not persuasive.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} In case 1, however, the trial court erred by imposing a different restitution\n\namount in the judgment entry than it did at the sentencing hearing, but the error was\n\nharmless. The right to be present that is protected by Crim.R. 43(A) implicates a\n\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights, but only to the extent that the defendant would be denied\n\na fair and just hearing if he were absent. State v. Jones, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-18-\n\n036, 2019-Ohio-2646, \u00b6 6, citing State v. Wilks, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562,\n\n114 N.E.3d 1092, \u00b6 215. Therefore, a violation of Crim.R. 43(A) is subject to a\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\fharmless-error analysis, and we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment unless the\n\ndefendant demonstrates that he was prejudiced by the imposition of a sentence in the\n\njudgment entry but not at the sentencing hearing. Id.; Lantz at \u00b6 9. Prejudice can exist\n\nwhen the discrepancy between the court\u2019s oral and written pronouncements creates an\n\nunclear sentence or eliminates the defendant\u2019s right to object. Lantz at \u00b6 9. But, when\n\nthe defendant agrees to a specific amount of restitution in a plea agreement, and the court\n\nimposes the agreed amount in its sentencing entry, the defendant cannot show prejudice\n\nbased solely on the court\u2019s failure to order restitution in open court at the sentencing\n\nhearing. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Here, Eames has not shown that he was prejudiced by the discrepancy in\n\nthe amount of restitution ordered at the sentencing hearing and the amount imposed in the\n\ncase 1 sentencing entry. The record shows that Eames was aware of the restitution\n\namount and explicitly agreed to pay it. He signed a plea agreement in case 1 in which he\n\nagreed to pay a total of $5,247.62 in restitution, jointly and severally with his\n\ncodefendant, to the victims in that case. This amount was incorporated into the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s ILC plan, and Eames signed copies of the terms and conditions of his ILC plan\n\nthat listed aggregate restitution in case 1 of $5,247.62. Eames also acknowledged at the\n\nsentencing hearing that he agreed to pay restitution in both cases. Eames does not argue\n\nthat the higher amount in the sentencing entry differs from the amount of restitution he\n\nagreed to pay, is somehow inaccurate, or resulted in any other prejudice. Because Eames\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\fhas not shown that the court\u2019s error in stating the amount of restitution in case 1 at the\n\nsentencing hearing prejudiced him, any error was harmless. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Eames also contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider his\n\nability to pay restitution. A court is generally required to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cpresent\n\nand future ability to pay * * *\u201d before imposing a financial sanction permitted by R.C.\n\n2929.18, including restitution. R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). However, the court is not required to\n\nconsider the defendant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing restitution that the defendant\n\nagreed to as part of a plea agreement. State v. Jordan, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-19-1165,\n\n2021-Ohio-333, \u00b6 8. Moreover, a defendant who \u201cagrees to pay restitution as part of their\n\nplea agreement \u2018waives the issue of whether he or she will be able in the future to pay the\n\namount agreed upon.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Coburn, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-006,\n\n2010-Ohio-692, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} As already noted, Eames agreed to pay specific restitution amounts in each\n\ncase as part of his plea agreements. He cannot now claim that the trial court erred by\n\nfailing to consider his ability to pay the agreed-upon amounts because a defendant who\n\n\u201cagrees to pay restitution in a plea agreement cannot challenge, on appeal, the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to consider his or her ability to pay before imposing restitution * * *.\u201d Id.\n\nat \u00b6 10.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} Eames\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f                                     III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 23} For the foregoing reasons, the April 14, 2023 judgments of the Wood\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas are affirmed. Eames is ordered to pay the costs of this\n\nappeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\n                                                                      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.\nSee also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.\n\n\n\nThomas J.

Because any errors in the indictment are not prejudicial and Petitto\u2019s\n\nconvictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of\n\fthe evidence, they are affirmed. The trial court\u2019s erroneous imposition of postrelease\n\ncontrol requires a limited remand.\n\n                            I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} On April 1, 2021, the Ottawa County Grand Jury indicted Petitto on charges\n\nstemming from a high-speed police chase in Ottawa County, Ohio. Relevant to this\n\nappeal, the state secured an indictment against Petitto charging her with two counts of\n\nfelonious assault, R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), as follows:\n\n              Count One Felonious Assault -F1, \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n              The jurors of the Grand Jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the\n\n       body of Ottawa County, on their oaths, IN THE NAME AND BY THE\n\n       AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF OHIO, do find and present:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle\/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F1.\n\n              FURTHERMORE, the victim of the offense was a peace officer.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n              Count Two Felonious Assault-F2 \u00a72903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\f              The grand jurors, on their oaths, further find and present that:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle\/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F2.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At Petitto\u2019s April 5, 2021 arraignment, the trial court found her indigent and\n\nappointed her counsel; Petitto then waived a reading of the applicable law and penalties\n\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. On April 15, 2021, Petitto\u2019s retained counsel\n\nentered an appearance prompting the withdrawal of appointed counsel. On June 9, 2021,\n\nretained counsel requested leave to withdraw citing Petitto\u2019s lack of cooperation. Petitto\n\nretained a third attorney.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} On February 8, 2022, Petitto changed her plea to not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. Following a competency hearing, the\n\ntrial court found Petitto competent to stand trial. Petitto subsequently made oral request\n\nfor an indigency determination and appointed counsel. On June 30, 2022, Petitto was\n\nagain appointed counsel.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\f       {\u00b6 5} At the December 2 and 22, 2022 bench trial, Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s\n\nSergeant Brandon Amory testified that on March 13, 2021, at approximately 1:41 p.m.,\n\nhe was on road patrol in a marked vehicle and observed Petitto eastbound on S.R. 2 in a\n\nvehicle with no discernable license plate. Amory activated his overhead lights and siren\n\nto initiate a traffic stop. Petitto sped away leading Amory on a high-speed chase.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} Travelling over 90 m.p.h., Petitto exited S.R. 2 at the S.R. 53 south off-\n\nramp. Her vehicle \u201clurched\u201d sharply to the right, up on two wheels, and came back\n\nacross into Amory\u2019s lane of travel striking the front and driver\u2019s side of his vehicle and\n\npushing both vehicles against the guardrail. Sergeant Amory testified that Petitto\n\n\u201ccontinued to rev her engine at that point in time and was lurching forward, inching,\n\nstretching forward.\u201d Amory put his vehicle in reverse to disengage but Petitto\n\n\u201caccelerated\u201d and \u201csmashed\u201d into the passenger side of his vehicle. Amory stated that\n\nthe impact was \u201cdefinitely a jolt\u201d but that the airbags did not deploy. He admitted that\n\nthe maneuver was not necessarily directed at hitting him and that it could have been that\n\nshe was trying to disengage and flee. Amory radioed an injury accident.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Petitto continued northbound on S.R. 53 towards the city of Port Clinton.\n\nSergeant Amory stated that initially his patrol vehicle failed to accelerate due to the crash\n\nbut that his pursuit resumed after the engine \u201ckicked in.\u201d Disregarding all traffic signals\n\nand driving in excess of 90 m.p.h., Petitto entered the Port Clinton city limits. She\n\nnavigated a sharp curve at 60-65 m.p.h. and turned left, or northbound, at Harrison and\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fFremont Streets. The chase ended following a collision between Petitto and a vehicle\n\ndriven by S.R., incapacitating both vehicles.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Sergeant Amory radioed a second injury accident. He ordered Petitto out of\n\nthe vehicle and handcuffed her. He testified:\n\n               At that point in time I kind of collapsed backwards for a second\n\n       because I had gotten jolted back there at the intersection. But my\n\n       adrenaline was kicking, too, and I kind of gathered myself. I ended up\n\n       getting up at that point in time.\n\n               ***\n\n               [T]he jolt had pushed me into my printer, my printer is on my\n\n       console in the center for printing citations. * * * I had taken that jolt and it\n\n       jolted into the side of me. That was part of the pain into the rib area. And\n\n       at that point in time, I kind of collapsed. A lady who was an EMT came up.\n\n       Asked me if I\u2019m okay. I said, I\u2019m fine. Go check on the other victim,\n\n       basically.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Amory\u2019s collapse was captured by the body cam video. He admitted that he\n\nwas medically cleared for service without any time off and that he did not take any\n\nmedications.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Sergeant Amory\u2019s pursuit of Petitto spanned seven to eight miles with a\n\nmaximum speed of 104 m.p.h. He stated that he did not activate his body cam until after\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\fthe initial collisions. The balance of the pursuit and arrest were recorded and played for\n\nthe court. Also played and admitted into evidence was surveillance video from a nearby\n\nbusiness capturing the collision involving S.R. Photographs depicting the crash sites and\n\ndamage to the vehicles were admitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Mentis responded to the second\n\ncrash site. Reviewing the crash photographs, Mentis testified regarding his observations\n\nof the damage to the vehicles involved. He authored the second crash report which was\n\nadmitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Trooper Mentis took Petitto\u2019s and S.R.\u2019s statements which were admitted\n\ninto evidence. In her statement, Petitto admitted that during the incident she failed to\n\nobey all traffic signals and was not distracted by anything during the incident.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The driver involved in the second crash, S.R., and her husband, T.R.,\n\ntestified. S.R. testified that prior to the crash she had rods and screws lining her back\n\nfrom multiple spine surgeries and a neck surgery to correct scoliosis. Following the\n\naccident she was bedridden for two weeks in excruciating pain and that as of the date of\n\ntrial, she had chronic back pain and was still seeing an oral surgeon for pain management.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} S.R. stated that she saw Petitto\u2019s vehicle approach just before impact and\n\nthought she was going to die. She had no memory of the actual collision. S.R. testified\n\nthat her six-month-old car was totaled and had to be replaced. T.R., S.R.\u2019s husband,\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fstated that the crash impacted S.R.\u2019s mobility and limited her ability to travel. She could\n\nno longer perform any household tasks.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} On January 6, 2023, the trial court filed its verdict finding Petitto guilty of\n\nCounts 1-6 and dismissing Count 7 at the state\u2019s request. At Petitto\u2019s February 24, 2023\n\nsentencing hearing, the court noted that Counts 1 and 2, as first and second-degree\n\nfelonies, were subject to indefinite sentencing under R.C. 2929.144, and that Counts 3-5\n\nmerged. The state elected to proceed on Count 5.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} The court stated it considered the sentencing factors under R.C. 2929.11\n\nand 2929.12. As to Count 1, felonious assault of a peace officer, the court sentenced\n\nPetitto to a prison term of 8 to 12 years; on Count 2, felonious assault, 8 years of\n\nimprisonment, to be served concurrently with Count 1. On Count 5, failure to comply\n\nwith the order of a police officer, Petitto was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment to\n\nbe served consecutively to the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 for a total of 11 to 15 years of\n\nimprisonment. Petitto was fined $30 for the seatbelt violation, Count 6.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} The court then gave Petitto the following postrelease control notification:\n\n\u201cYou will be required to serve a mandatory five-year term of post-release control\n\nfollowing your release from prison.\u201d The February 24, 2023 sentencing judgment entry\n\nsimilarly stated: \u201cThe Court explained the concepts of post release control and advised\n\nthat the Defendant would be subject to a mandatory period of five (5) years of post\n\nrelease control upon release from prison.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\f     {\u00b6 18} This appeal followed.\n\n                              II. Assignments of Error\n\n     {\u00b6 19} Petitto raises five assignments of error for review:\n\n            Assignment of Error I: Counts One and Two of the indictment\n\n     against Appellant were defective because they failed to track the language\n\n     of R.C. 2903.11 naming Felonious Assault as a criminal offense and as a\n\n     first and second-degree felony, respectively, in violation of Appellant\u2019s\n\n     right to Due Process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\n     United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution, and Appellant\u2019s right to indictment under Article I, Section 10\n\n     of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error II: The failure of Appellant\u2019s trial counsel to\n\n     file a Motion to Dismiss with respect to Counts One and Two of the\n\n     Indictment constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of\n\n     Appellant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\n     the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error III: Appellant\u2019s convictions for Felonious\n\n     Assault were not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f              Assignment of Error IV: Appellant\u2019s convictions were against the\n\n       manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n              Assignment of Error V: The trial court\u2019s sentence of Appellant was\n\n       contrary to law for incorrectly stating Appellant\u2019s term of post-release\n\n       control.\n\n                                       III. Discussion\n\n                                    A. The Indictment\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Petitto\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the felonious assault counts,\n\nCounts 1 and 2, in the indictment were defective because they failed to track the statutory\n\nlanguage.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Crim.R. 12(C) provides that \u201c[p]rior to trial, any party may raise by motion\n\nany * * * objection * * * that is capable of determination without the trial of the general\n\nissue. The following must be raised before trial: * * * (2) Defenses and objections based\n\non defects in the indictment[.]\u201d \u201c\u2018By failing to timely object to a defect in an indictment,\n\na defendant waives all but plain error on appeal. Crim.R. 12(C)(2).\u2019\u201d State v. Bey, 2019-\n\nOhio-423, 130 N.E.3d 1031, \u00b6 20 (6th Dist.), quoting State v. Horner, 126 Ohio St.3d\n\n466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, paragraph three of the syllabus. Petitto\n\nacknowledges her failure to raise the alleged defects in the indictment prior to trial limits\n\nher to a plain error review.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\f      {\u00b6 22} Crim.R. 7(B) set forth the requirements of an indictment or information and\n\nrelevantly provides:\n\n             The indictment shall be signed in accordance with Crim.R. 6(C) and\n\n      (F) and contain a statement that the defendant has committed a public\n\n      offense specified in the indictment. * * *. The statement may be made in\n\n      ordinary and concise language without technical averments or allegations\n\n      not essential to be proved. The statement may be in the words of the\n\n      applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge\n\n      an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the\n\n      elements of the offense with which the defendant is charged. It may be\n\n      alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed\n\n      the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more\n\n      specified means. Each count of the indictment or information shall state\n\n      the numerical designation of the statute that the defendant is alleged to have\n\n      violated. Error in the numerical designation or omission of the numerical\n\n      designation shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or\n\n      information, or for reversal of a conviction, if the error or omission did not\n\n      prejudicially mislead the defendant.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f       {\u00b6 23} \u201cThe purposes of an indictment are to give an accused adequate notice of\n\nthe charge, and enable an accused to protect himself or herself from any future\n\nprosecutions for the same incident.\u201d State v. Buehner, 110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-\n\n4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162, \u00b6 7, citing Weaver v. Sacks, 173 Ohio St. 415, 417, 183 N.E.2d\n\n373 (1962), and State v. Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985);\n\nHorner at \u00b6 11.\n\n              \u201cAn indictment meets constitutional requirements if it \u2018first, contains\n\n       the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\n       charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an\n\n       acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\u2019\u201d\n\n       State v. Childs, 88 Ohio St.3d 558, 564-565, 728 N.E.2d 379 (2000),\n\n       quoting Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41\n\n       L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).\n\nState v. Troisi, 169 Ohio St.3d 514, 2022-Ohio-3582, 206 N.E.3d 695, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} Petitto argues prejudice in the omission of the statutory penalty language in\n\nR.C. 2903.11(D)(1)(a), and the improper inclusion of R.C. 2903.11(B) (felonious assault\n\nwhere an accused engaged in sexual conduct without disclosing the accused\u2019s HIV\n\npositive status). Petitto claims that these errors contravene the Civ.R. 7 requirement that\n\nshe be adequately notified of the charges and what the state intends to prove at trial.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 25} Here, the indictment indicates that Count 1, felonious assault, was in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and that Petitto \u201ccaused or attempted to cause physical\n\nharm\u201d to a peace officer by the use of an automobile and that the count was a first-degree\n\nfelony. Similarly, Count 2 lists felonious assault as a violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)\n\nand specifies that the charge was a second-degree felony. There is no indication that the\n\nabsence of the specific penalty section prejudiced Petitto as the felony degree was\n\nindicated. Further, although the inclusion of the HIV subsection was incorrect, the\n\nindictment specifies that Petitto\u2019s felonious assault charges stemmed from the use of her\n\nautomobile as a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Upon review, Petitto was neither prejudiced nor misled by any error or\n\nomission in the indictment and her first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Petitto relatedly argues in her second assignment of error that trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to raise the defective indictment issue denied her effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. An attorney is constitutionally ineffective where serious errors are made and the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Proof of prejudice requires a showing \u201cthat\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of\n\nthe proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694; State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d\n\n136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 28} Because there is no prejudice as to Petitto\u2019s first assignment of error, it\n\nfollows that Petitto\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the issue. Petitto\u2019s\n\nsecond assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                  B. Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Petitto\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error contend that her felonious\n\nassault convictions are based on insufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence. The arguments are related and will be jointly addressed.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} \u201cInsufficiency and manifest weight are distinct legal theories.\u201d State v.\n\nFenderson, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-21-018, 2022-Ohio-1973, \u00b6 73. \u201cIn reviewing a record\n\nfor sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Jenks, 61\n\nOhio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} In contrast, when reviewing a manifest weight claim,\n\n              \u201c[t]he court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all\n\n       reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines\n\n       whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way\n\n       and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must\n\n       be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\f       new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the\n\n       evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d\n\nId., quoting State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 220,\n\nquoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\n       {\u00b6 32} At issue are Petitto\u2019s felonious assault convictions in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.11(A)(2), which provides that \u201cno person shall knowingly * * * [c]ause or attempt\n\nto cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous\n\nordnance.\u201d Petitto contends that the state failed to present sufficient evidence of the\n\nknowingly, mens rea element, failed to demonstrate physical harm, and failed to prove\n\nthat Petitto\u2019s vehicle was a dangerous weapon or ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} R.C. 2901.22(B) defines the \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state as follows:\n\n              A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is\n\n       aware that the person\u2019s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will\n\n       probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances\n\n       when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When\n\n       knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense,\n\n       such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is\n\n       a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a\n\n       conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\f       {\u00b6 34} To prove Petitto acted knowingly, the state needed to demonstrate that\n\nserious physical harm was a reasonable and probable result of her conduct. State v.\n\nStevens, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-19-1219, 2020-Ohio-6981, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Laney, 6th\n\nDist. Williams No. WM-18-004, 2019-Ohio-2648, \u00b6 19. Petitto\u2019s state of mind, may be\n\n\u201c\u2018inferred from the totality of circumstances surrounding the incident.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting\n\nState v. Rodriquez, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-02-046, 2003-Ohio-3453, \u00b6 36, citing State\n\nv. Booth, 133 Ohio App.3d 555, 562, 729 N.E.2d 406 (10th Dist.1999).\n\n       {\u00b6 35} \u201cWhen a defendant evades police and crashes a vehicle into a police\n\ncruiser, the defendant is usually deemed to have acted knowingly because it is likely that\n\nthe officer would suffer physical harm from the collision.\u201d State v. Wells, 4th Dist.\n\nWashington No. 21CA16, 2022-Ohio-3793, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Taylor, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 90001, 2008-Ohio-3455, \u00b6 68. Wells further relies on cases from the\n\nThird, Ninth, and Tenth Appellate Districts upholding felonious assault convictions\n\nwhere the defendant accelerated and struck or rammed a police vehicle. See State v.\n\nAllsup, 3d Dist. Hardin Nos. 6-10-06, 6-10-07, 2011-Ohio-405; State v. Gibson, 9th Dist.\n\nSummit No. 23881, 2008-Ohio-410; State v. Beatty, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-52,\n\n2008-Ohio-5063.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} Here, as to Sergeant Amory, the evidence demonstrates that Petitto led\n\nAmory on a high-speed chase causing two collisions with his patrol vehicle. Similarly, as\n\nto S.R., Petitto, travelling at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic signals, collided\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\fwith her vehicle. It is reasonable and probable that her actions would physically harm\n\nothers.\n\n          {\u00b6 37} Petitto next argues that insufficient evidence supported a finding that her\n\nvehicle was used as a dangerous weapon when her intent was to evade police, not cause\n\nor attempt to cause physical harm.\n\n          {\u00b6 38} A vehicle can be a deadly weapon, \u201cwhen used in a manner likely to\n\nproduce death or great bodily harm.\u201d State v. Belcher, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-13-1250,\n\nL-13-1252, 2014-Ohio-5596, \u00b6 29, citing State v. Gimenez, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n71190, *7 (Sept. 4, 1997). In determining whether a vehicle was used as a deadly\n\nweapon, \u201c[t]he intent of the user, manner of use, and actions of the user are among the\n\nfactors that must be examined.\u201d Belcher at \u00b6 29, citing Giminez at *7. Intent to cause the\n\nspecific harm is not required. State v. Stevens, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-10-1003, 2010-\n\nOhio-4718, \u00b6 25. See State v. Nastal, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-21-042, 2022-Ohio-970, \u00b6\n\n20.\n\n          {\u00b6 39} Here, Petitto\u2019s actions belie her argument. As previously set forth, Petitto\n\nled Sergeant Amory on a high-speed chase spanning several miles. Following the first\n\ntwo collisions, Petitto continued her flight toward the city limits while disregarding all\n\ntraffic signals. The chase ended only after her vehicle was disabled by the third collision.\n\nViewing the evidence in the state\u2019s favor, the dangerous weapon element was supported\n\nby sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f       {\u00b6 40} Petitto next contends that insufficient evidence supports the serious\n\nphysical harm element as to Sergeant Amory. Petitto argues that Amory suffered only\n\nminor injuries, if any. Physical harm is defined as \u201cany injury, illness, or other\n\nphysiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(3).\n\nPhysical harm \u201crequires some manifestation of harm to the [victim], whether it be in the\n\nform of a visible or objective injury, or in the form of pain.\u201d State v. Jasso, 6th Dist.\n\nFulton No. F-22-001, 2023-Ohio-209, \u00b6 28, quoting State v. Brown, 6th Dist. Lucas No.\n\nL-18-1140, 2020-Ohio-1650, \u00b6 20.\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Sergeant Amory testified that the impact of the collision \u201cwas definitely a\n\njolt.\u201d After the chase ended and the adrenaline rush waned, Amory stated that the pain in\n\nhis side from being shoved into the citation printer in the patrol vehicle console caused\n\nhim to fall to the ground. This testimony was sufficient to demonstrate that Amory\n\nsuffered physical harm. See Jasso at \u00b6 29.\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Construing the evidence most favorably for the state, sufficient evidence\n\nsupports the elements of felonious assault. This includes evidence of intent, that serious\n\nphysical harm was a probable\u2014as opposed to a merely likely\u2014result of Petitto\u2019s\n\nconduct, and that her vehicle was properly categorized as a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\nPetitto\u2019s third assignment of error, therefore, is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Petitto makes near-identical arguments in support of her fourth assignment\n\nof error by arguing that her felonious assault convictions were against the manifest\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fweight of the evidence because the evidence failed to establish the elements of intent,\n\nphysical harm, and the use of a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Reviewing the entire proceeding, the trial court did not lose its way or\n\ncreate a manifest injustice in weighing the evidence or resolving any conflicting\n\nevidence. This includes Amory\u2019s testimony that the collisions with his vehicle may have\n\nbeen the result of Petitto\u2019s attempt to escape, not her intent to hit his patrol vehicle and\n\nhis testimony regarding whether the collisions caused him injury. The trial court was free\n\nto infer that Petitto\u2019s actions, including her high rate of speed and disregard of traffic\n\nsignals, evidenced her intent to cause physical harm and the use of her vehicle as a\n\ndangerous weapon or ordnance. Sergeant Amory testified regarding the jolt caused by\n\nthe collision and the body cam video depicts him falling to the ground from the pain in\n\nhis side. Victim, S.R., testified as to her chronic pain and decreased quality of life\n\nresulting from the accident. Thus, Petitto\u2019s felonious assault convictions were not against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence and her fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                   C. Postrelease Control\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Petitto\u2019s fifth assignment of error is that her sentence is contrary to law due\n\nto the trial court\u2019s failure to properly impose postrelease control. The state has conceded\n\nerror pursuant to 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 10(H)\n\n       {\u00b6 46} \u201c\u2018[S]entencing errors in the imposition of postrelease control render the\n\nsentence voidable, not void, and the sentence may be set aside if successfully challenged\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\fon direct appeal.\u2019\u201d State v. Sprouse, 6th Lucas No. L-22-1230, 2023-Ohio-2983, \u00b6 24,\n\nquoting State v. Harper, 160 Ohio St.3d 480, 2020-Ohio-2913, 159 N.E.3d 248, \u00b6 42.\n\n\u201c\u2018And if a court improperly imposes postrelease control on a sentence imposed on or\n\nafter July 11, 2006, it may correct the sentence in accordance with the procedures set\n\nforth in R.C. 2929.191, which provides that a court must hold a hearing before issuing the\n\ncorrection.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Schleiger, 141 Ohio St.3d 67, 2014-Ohio-3970, 21\n\nN.E.3d 1033, \u00b6 15.\n\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2967.28(B) requires that the court impose mandatory postrelease\n\ncontrol terms based on the degree of felony. It provides:\n\n              [A] period of post-release control required by this division for an\n\n       offender shall be of one of the following periods:\n\n              (1) For a felony sex offense, five years;\n\n              (2) For a felony of the first degree that is not a felony sex offense, up\n\n       to five years, but not less than two years;\n\n              (3) For a felony of the second degree that is not a felony sex offense,\n\n       up to three years, but not less than eighteen months;\n\n              (4) For a felony of the third degree that is an offense of violence and\n\n       is not a felony sex offense, up to three years, but not less than one year.\n\n       {\u00b6 48} Petitto\u2019s felonious assault conviction is a first-degree, non sex offense,\n\nfelony. Thus, R.C. 2967.28(B)(2) applies and requires the imposition of a two-to-five-\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\fyear postrelease control term. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s sentence of Petitto to a\n\n\u201cmandatory\u201d five-year postrelease control term was erroneous. Petitto\u2019s fifth assignment\n\nof error is well-taken.\n\n                                      IV. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 49} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas is affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part. The portion of the judgment\n\nimposing postrelease control is reversed and vacated. The remaining portions of the\n\njudgment are affirmed. The case is remanded for the limited purpose of resentencing of\n\npostrelease control pursuant to R.C. 2929.191(C). Pursuant to App.R. 24, costs of this\n\nappeal are to be divided evenly between the parties.\n\n                                                                Judgment affirmed, in part,\n                                                                     and reversed, in part,\n                                                                           and remanded.\n\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.\nSee also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.\n\n\nThomas J.

The Record before us tends to reflect the following:\n\n      On 17 May 2021, an Officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police\n\nDepartment initiated a stop of Defendant\u2019s vehicle on suspicion of a fictitious tag.\n\nWhen the Officer pulled over Defendant and approached the car, he observed\n\f                                  STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nDefendant \u201cfumbling through to get some paperwork\u201d with his hands \u201cshaking,\u201d and\n\nnoted Defendant appeared \u201cvery nervous.\u201d Defendant was the only person in the car.\n\nDefendant gave the Officer his identification card and the car\u2019s paperwork. The\n\nOfficer determined the car was not stolen, but Defendant was driving on a revoked\n\nlicense. The Officer returned to Defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him \u201cabout the odor\n\nof marijuana in the vehicle.\u201d    Defendant denied smoking marijuana in the car,\n\nprompting the following exchange:\n\n         Officer: You didn\u2019t have a blunt earlier or anything?\n\n         Defendant: No. I just got the car from my homeboy. That\u2019s\n         probably why.\n\n         Officer: Is that why it smells like weed in here?\n\n         Defendant: Yeah\u2014\n\n         Officer: \u2014because he might have smoked a blunt or something\n         earlier?\n\n         Defendant: Yeah.\n\nThe Officer then asked Defendant to get out of the car. Defendant did so and took\n\nsome belongings with him, including a cellphone, cigarettes, and a Crown Royal bag.\n\nThe Officer took Defendant\u2019s items and put them in the driver\u2019s seat of the car to pat\n\ndown Defendant for weapons. After the search and finding no weapons, the Officer\n\nreturned Defendant\u2019s cellphone and cigarettes, but opened and searched the Crown\n\nRoyal bag. In the bag, the Officer found a digital scale, a green leafy substance, two\n\nbaggies of white powder, and \u201cnumerous baggies of colorful pills[.]\u201d\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                  STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      On 24 May 2021, Defendant was subsequently indicted for Possession of Drug\n\nParaphernalia, Trafficking in Drugs, and Possession with Intent to Sell or Deliver a\n\nControlled Substance based on this evidence. On 17 August 2022, Defendant filed a\n\nMotion to Suppress the evidence from the Crown Royal bag, arguing the Officer\n\nlacked probable cause to search the car, and consequently, lacked probable cause to\n\nsearch the bag.\n\n      Specifically, at the hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress on 23 August\n\n2022, Defendant contended that because hemp, which Defendant argued is\n\nindistinguishable from marijuana in odor and appearance, is legal in North Carolina,\n\nthe odor of marijuana alone was no longer sufficient to establish probable cause for\n\nthe ensuing searches. The State argued that binding precedent in this state holds\n\nthat marijuana odor alone per se supports a finding of probable cause to support a\n\nsearch. Further, the State asserted even presuming odor alone was insufficient, the\n\nOfficer had additional evidence supporting probable cause, including Defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201cfidgety\u201d behavior, the fact Defendant was driving with a fictitious tag and without a\n\nvalid license, and Defendant\u2019s agreement marijuana may have been smoked in the\n\ncar earlier, which the trial court characterized as \u201can acknowledgment, if not an\n\nadmission\u201d marijuana had been smoked in the car.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court orally granted Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion. In rendering its ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cSo I think that the standards\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                       STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nset forth in Parker1 which is abbreviated odor plus is certainly the appropriate\n\nstandard to use here.\u201d The trial court acknowledged \u201cthe odor of something that could\n\nbe marijuana but might be CBD or hemp or a legal hemp-related product is certainly\n\nan issue or a consideration for law enforcement to make note of when evaluating or\n\ntrying to reach probable cause.\u201d The trial court further acknowledged, \u201c[a]nd in this\n\ncircumstance arguably there were additional factors to consider\u201d including the traffic\n\nviolations and the acknowledgment \u201cthat weed, bud, the colloquial for marijuana, was\n\nsmoked in the vehicle previously.\u201d The trial court, however, concluded: \u201cI just think\n\nin the totality here and given the new world that we live in, that odor plus is the\n\nstandard and we didn\u2019t get the plus here. There was no probable cause.\u201d\n\n          The State filed written Notice of Appeal on 29 August 2022. The Notice of\n\nAppeal, however, stated the appeal was from an order \u201cgrant[ing] the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss[.]\u201d        Two days later, on 31 August 2022, the State filed a\n\nCertification, certifying that the appeal was not taken for the purpose of delay and\n\nthat the evidence suppressed is essential to the case.\n\n                                   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n          The parties do not address appellate jurisdiction in their briefing to this Court.\n\nHowever, the State\u2019s Notice of Appeal, the later Certification of its interlocutory\n\nappeal, failure to include a Statement of Grounds for Appellate Review in its brief,\n\n\n1 State v.

See State v. Webber, 190 N.C. App. 649, 650, 660 S.E.2d 621, 622 (2008)\n\n(\u201cIt is well-established that the issue of a court\u2019s jurisdiction over a matter may be\n\nraised at any time, even . . . by a court sua sponte.\u201d).\n\n      First, \u201cwhen a [party] has not properly given notice of appeal, this Court is\n\nwithout jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d State v. McCoy, 171 N.C. App. 636, 638, 615\n\nS.E.2d 319, 320 (2005). Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nsets out the requirements for a notice of appeal in criminal cases. See N.C.R. App. P.\n\n4 (2023). Relevant to this case, Rule 4(b) provides the requisite contents of a written\n\nnotice of appeal:\n\n          The notice of appeal required to be filed and served . . . shall\n          specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the\n          judgment or order from which appeal is taken and the court to\n          which appeal is taken; and shall be signed by counsel of record for\n          the party or parties taking the appeal, or by any such party not\n          represented by counsel of record.\n\nN.C.R. App. P 4(b) (emphasis added).           \u201cOur Supreme Court has said that a\n\njurisdictional default, such as a failure to comply with Rule 4, \u2018precludes the appellate\n\ncourt from acting in any manner other than to dismiss the appeal.\u2019 \u201d            State v.\n\nHammonds, 218 N.C.

Rather, the\n\nState\u2019s arguments focus entirely on the grant of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress. We\n\nacknowledge, however, \u201c \u2018a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not result\n\nin loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be\n\nfairly inferred from the notice and the appeal is not misled by the mistake[.]\u2019 \u201d\n\nStephenson v.

App. 153, 156-57, 392 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1990)).\n\n      Our Court has observed that granting a motion to suppress\u2014even of evidence\n\nwhich is essential to the State\u2019s case\u2014is not synonymous with dismissal of the case.\n\nSee State v.

App. 701, 706, 649\n\nS.E.2d 646, 650 (2007))).\n\n      Indeed, this highlights a second jurisdictional issue: the State\u2019s appeal is from\n\nan interlocutory order. See Romano, 268 N.C. App. at 445, 836 S.E.2d at 767 (an\n\norder granting a motion to suppress is an interlocutory\u2014not final\u2014decision). N.C.\n\nGen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) provides the State a statutory right of appeal from an Order\n\ndenying a motion to suppress prior to trial \u201cupon certificate by the prosecutor to the\n\njudge who granted the motion that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay\n\nand that the evidence is essential to the case.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) (2021).\n\nThis Court has recognized Section 15A-979(c) \u201cnot only requires the State to raise its\n\nright to appeal according to the statutory mandate, but also places the burden on the\n\nState to demonstrate that it had done so.\u201d State v. Dobson, 51 N.C. App. 445, 447,\n\n276 S.E.2d 480, 482 (1981).      Similarly, Rule 28(b)(4) of the Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure requires: \u201cAn appellant\u2019s brief shall contain . . . [a] statement of the\n\ngrounds for appellate review. Such statement shall include citation of the statute or\n\nstatutes permitting appellate review.\u201d N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(4) (2023).\n\n      Crucially, \u201cwhen an appeal is interlocutory, Rule 28(b)(4) is not a\n\n\u2018nonjurisdictional\u2019 rule. Rather, the only way an appellant may establish appellate\n\njurisdiction in an interlocutory case . . . is by showing grounds for appellate review[.]\u201d\n\nLarsen v.

This burden rests solely with the appellant. Jeffreys v. Raleigh Oaks\n\nJoint Venture, 115 N.C. App. 377, 379, 444 S.E.2d 252, 253 (1994).\n\n      Here, in violation of N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(4), the State wholly failed to include\n\nany statement of grounds for appellate review. The State\u2019s brief offers no discussion\n\nof its defective Notice of Appeal or the timeliness of its subsequently filed\n\nCertification of the appeal. Nowhere in briefing does the State cite to N.C. Gen. Stat.\n\n\u00a7 15A-979 as statutory support for its interlocutory appeal. Moreover, the State\u2019s\n\nappeal is from an orally rendered Order granting a Motion to Dismiss without written\n\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law. The State, however, offers no basis or rationale\n\nfor our ability to review the orally rendered Order in this circumstance. The State\u2019s\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure combined with its\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 28(b)(4) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure constitutes a\n\njurisdictional defect in the appeal depriving this Court of appellate jurisdiction\n\nrequiring dismissal of the appeal.\n\n      Nevertheless, even assuming the shortcomings in the State\u2019s appeal and\n\nbriefing do not rise to the level of jurisdictional defects, they still constitute\n\nsubstantial violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure impairing and frustrating\n\nthis Court\u2019s ability to review the merits. See Dogwood, 362 N.C. at 201, 657 S.E.2d\n\nat 367.    Here, the defects in the appeal\u2014at a minimum\u2014raise substantial\n\n                                            -8-\n\f                                      STATE V.

This not only hampers our ability to judicially review this matter efficiently\n\nand effectively but also frustrates the appellate adversarial process by not squarely\n\nraising these issues to be briefed or addressed by Defendant. The State has also not\n\ntaken steps to recognize or remedy these defects, such as petitioning for certiorari.\n\n       Mindful of the admonishment \u201cit is not the role of this Court to create an appeal\n\nfor an appellant or to supplement an appellant\u2019s brief with legal authority or\n\narguments not contained therein[,]\u201d Thompson v. Bass, 261 N.C. App. 285, 292, 819\n\nS.E.2d 621, 627 (2018), we conclude the State\u2019s violations of the appellate rules are\n\nsubstantial enough to potentially warrant dismissal of its interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Thus, the State\u2019s violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure constitute\n\neither jurisdictional defects in the appeal mandating dismissal or substantial non-\n\njurisdictional violations of the appellate rules justifying dismissal of the appeal on\n\nthe basis that the State has failed to demonstrate appellate jurisdiction in this Court.\n\nTherefore, the State\u2014as the appellant\u2014has failed to meet its burden of establishing\n\nappellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Nevertheless, under N.C.

Killette, 381 N.C. 686, 691, 873\n\nS.E.2d 317, 320 (2022).        \u201cOur precedent establishes a two-factor test to assess\n\n                                              -9-\n\f                                   STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nwhether certiorari review by an appellate court is appropriate.         First, a writ of\n\ncertiorari should issue only if the petitioner can show \u2018merit or that error was\n\nprobably committed below.\u2019 \u201d Cryan v. Nat\u2019l Council of YMCA of the United States,\n\n384 N.C. 569, 572, 887 S.E.2d 848, 851 (2023). Second, a writ of certiorari should\n\nonly issue if there are extraordinary circumstances to justify it. Moore v. Moody, 304\n\nN.C. 719, 720, 285 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1982). \u201cThere is no fixed list of \u2018extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\u2019 that warrant certiorari review, but this factor generally requires a\n\nshowing of substantial harm, considerable waste of judicial resources, or \u2018wide-\n\nreaching issues of justice and liberty at stake.\u2019 \u201d Cryan, 384 N.C. at 573, 887 S.E.2d\n\nat 851 (quoting Doe v. City of Charlotte, 273 N.C. App. 10, 23, 848 S.E.2d 1, 11 (2020)).\n\n      Here, despite its defects, we conclude the State\u2019s appeal raises sufficient merit\n\nto consider issuance of the writ of certiorari. Moreover, given the posture of the case,\n\njudicial economy and efficient use of judicial resources weighs in favor of exercising\n\nour discretion to issue the writ of certiorari pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-32(c).\n\nHowever, given the substantial and gross violations of the Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure, we tax the costs of this appeal to the State as a sanction pursuant to\n\nN.C.R.

App. 630, 638, 571 S.E.2d 592, 598 (2002) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[i]t\n\nis a well-established rule that a search warrant is not required before a lawful search\n\nbased on probable cause of a motor vehicle . . . in a public vehicular area may take\n\nplace.\u201d State v.

Mitchell, 224 N.C. App. 171, 175, 735 S.E.2d 438, 441 (2012)\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn officer has probable cause to believe that\n\ncontraband is concealed within a vehicle when given all the circumstances known to\n\nhim, he believes there is a \u2018fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will\n\nbe found\u2019 therein.\u201d State v.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332 (1983)).\n\n      This Court and our state Supreme Court have repeatedly held that the odor of\n\nmarijuana alone provides probable cause to search the object or area that is the source\n\nof that odor. See, e.g., State v. Greenwood, 301 N.C. 705, 708, 273 S.E.2d 438, 441\n\n(1981); State v. Smith, 192 N.C. App. 690, 694, 666 S.E.2d 191, 194 (2008); State v.\n\nArmstrong, 236 N.C. App. 130, 133, 762 S.E.2d 641, 644 (2014).\n\n      Here, however, the trial court relied on our Court\u2019s decision in State v. Parker\n\nto apply what it described as an \u201codor plus\u201d standard in which while\u2014as the trial\n\ncourt articulated\u2014the odor of marijuana was a factor to consider, additional\n\ncircumstances were required to establish probable cause. In Parker, this Court noted:\n\n\u201cThe legal issues raised by the recent legalization of hemp have yet to be analyzed by\n\nthe appellate courts of this state.\u201d Parker, 277 N.C. App. at 541, 860 S.E.2d at 29.\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\f                                  STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nThis Court went on, however, to determine \u201cin the case before us today we need not\n\ndetermine whether the scent or visual identification of marijuana alone remains\n\nsufficient to grant an officer probable cause to search a vehicle.\u201d Id. This was so\n\nbecause we determined there were additional circumstances that supported probable\n\ncause for a warrantless search in that case beyond the odor of marijuana. Id.\n\n      As in Parker, Defendant here also relied on a memorandum published by the\n\nState Bureau of Investigation (SBI). The SBI memo explains that industrial hemp is\n\na variety of the same species of plant as marijuana, but it contains lower levels of\n\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical in marijuana.\n\nAccording to the SBI memo, the legalization hemp poses significant issues for law\n\nenforcement because \u201c[t]here is no easy way for law enforcement to distinguish\n\nbetween industrial hemp and marijuana\u201d and there is no way for law enforcement to\n\nquickly test and determine whether a substance is hemp or marijuana.            Thus,\n\nDefendant contended\u2014and the trial court agreed\u2014the odor of marijuana in this case\n\ndetected by the Officer did not itself give rise to probable cause to conduct the\n\nwarrantless search\u2014in particular\u2014of the Crown Royal bag on Defendant\u2019s person.\n\n      In this case, however, as in Parker, the Officer had several reasons in addition\n\nto the odor of marijuana to support probable cause to search the vehicle and,\n\nconsequently, the Crown Royal bag. As such, again, \u201cwe need not determine whether\n\nthe scent or visual identification of marijuana alone remains sufficient to grant an\n\nofficer probable cause to search a vehicle.\u201d Id.\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                        STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       First, as the trial court found, Defendant made \u201can acknowledgment, if not an\n\nadmission\u201d that marijuana had been smoked in the car earlier. Defendant made no\n\nassertion at the time the odor derived from legalized hemp. See id. at 541-42, 860\n\nS.E.2d at 29 (finding probable cause where a police officer smelled marijuana, the\n\ndefendant admitted to smoking marijuana earlier, and the defendant produced a\n\npartially smoked marijuana cigarette from his person). Further, Defendant was\n\ndriving a car with a fictitious tag, which the Officer had observed, and which\n\nprompted this stop. Cf. State v. Murray, 192 N.C. App. 684, 688-89, 666 S.E.2d 205,\n\n208 (2008) (finding a police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to support a traffic\n\nstop where the vehicle was obeying all traffic laws, and a check of the license plate\n\nshowed no irregularities).        Additionally, Defendant was driving with an invalid\n\nlicense, which the Officer confirmed prior to the search. See State v. Duncan, 287\n\nN.C. App. 467, 473-76, 883 S.E.2d 210, 214-16 (2023) (finding probable cause for a\n\nwarrantless arrest where law enforcement learned from a license plate check that\n\ndefendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was medically cancelled).2\n\nAdditionally, the Officer had probable cause to search both the vehicle itself and the\n\nCrown Royal bag. \u201cIf probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle,\n\n\n2 There was also testimony\u2014although disputed\u2014Defendant appeared nervous to the Officer because\n\nhis hands were \u201cshaking\u201d and he was \u201cfumbling through some paperwork\u201d when the Officer\napproached the vehicle. See State v. Corpening, 109 N.C. App. 586, 589-90, 427 S.E.2d 892, 895 (1993)\n(noting that a defendant\u2019s nervous behavior supported probable cause to search his vehicle). In\nrendering its Order, the trial court did not address this evidence. This underscores the utility of a\nwritten order in these circumstances including specific findings of fact and conclusions of law when\nallowing a motion to suppress.\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f                                   STATE V.

App. at 175, 735 S.E.2d at 441 (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 347, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1721 (2009)\n\n(holding probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity\n\n\u201cauthorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.\u201d\n\n(citation omitted)). This Court in Armstrong upheld the search of a vehicle\u2019s glove\n\ncompartment even after defendants were handcuffed and secured in a police patrol\n\nvehicle, which resulted in the discovery of cocaine. 236 N.C. App. at 133, 762 S.E.2d\n\nat 644. There, this Court found that the officers involved had probable cause to search\n\nthe vehicle based on the odor of marijuana emanating from it. Id. at 132-33, 762\n\nS.E.2d at 643-44. The present case is analogous.\n\n      As discussed supra, the Officer had probable cause to search the vehicle based\n\non the odor of marijuana and additional suspicious circumstances. On that basis, the\n\nOfficer had probable cause to search the vehicle \u201cand its contents\u201d for evidence.\n\nMitchell, 224 N.C. App. at 175, 735 S.E.2d at 441. The Crown Royal bag, as one of\n\nthe contents of the vehicle, was thus subject to the Officer\u2019s search. The fact that\n\nDefendant attempted to remove the Crown Royal bag is immaterial because the bag\n\nwas in the car at the time of the stop. See State v. Massenburg, 66 N.C. App. 127,\n\n130, 310 S.E.2d 619, 622 (1984) (\u201cThe scope of the search is not defined by the nature\n\nof the container in which the contraband is secreted but is defined by the object of the\n\nsearch and the places in which there is probable cause to believe it may be found.\u201d)\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\f                                   STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nHere, the object of the Officer\u2019s search was evidence of marijuana, which it was\n\nreasonable to believe could have been in the Crown Royal bag. Therefore, because\n\nthe Officer had probable cause to search the vehicle, he also had probable cause to\n\nsearch the Crown Royal bag.\n\n      Thus, the Officer was aware of several suspicious circumstances\u2014including\n\nthe odor of marijuana\u2014at the time of the search. Therefore, under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the Officer had probable cause to search the Crown Royal bag.\n\nConsequently, the trial court erred in granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress the\n\nevidence that resulted from the search.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s grant of Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion to Suppress is reversed, and this case is remanded for additional proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, due to the substantial violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n\nthe costs of this appeal are taxed to the State.\n\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n      Judge GRIFFIN concurs.\n\n      Judge MURPHY concurs in part and dissents in part by separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\f No. COA23-9 \u2013 State v.

Nat\u2019l Council of YMCAs of the U.S., 384\n             N.C. 569, 573 (2023) (quoting State v. Ricks, 378 N.C. 737,\n             741 (2021))]. \u201cIf courts issued writs of certiorari solely on\n             the showing of some error below, it would \u2018render\n             meaningless the rules governing the time and manner of\n             noticing appeals.\u2019\u201d Id. at 573 (quoting Ricks, 378 N.C. at\n             741). An extraordinary circumstance \u201cgenerally requires a\n             showing of substantial harm, considerable waste of judicial\n             resources, or \u2018wide-reaching issues of justice and liberty at\n             stake.\u2019\u201d Id. at 573 (quoting Doe v. City of Charlotte, 273\n             N.C. App. 10, 23 (2020)).\n\n             Here, Defendant argues the trial court erred, but\n             Defendant fails to explain why this case involves an\n             extraordinary circumstance sufficient to excuse his failure\n             to preserve his right to appeal. Notably, Defendant fails to\n             mention the word \u201cextraordinary\u201d in his PWC. Defendant\n             merely concludes that the \u201cinterests of justice thus require\u201d\n             us to grant a writ of certiorari. Defendant\u2019s argument falls\n             far short of our extraordinary-circumstance standard, and\n             further, our review of the record reveals no extraordinary\n             circumstances. See id. at 573. Therefore, we deny\n             Defendant\u2019s PWC and dismiss his appeal for lack of\n             jurisdiction. See [State v.

(Conservatorship of Ben C. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 529.)\nAfter considering defendant\u2019s supplemental brief, we conclude there are no arguable\nissues that would result in a more favorable outcome to defendant and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n       In March 2021, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. SCCR-CRF-\n2021-320-1 with assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); statutory\nsection citations that follow are found in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated);\nexhibiting a deadly weapon to a peace officer with the intent to resist and prevent arrest\nand detention (\u00a7 417.8); and resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer (\u00a7 148,\nsubd. (a)(1)). The complaint alleged a prior 2013 Massachusetts conviction for assault to\ncommit murder with a knife as a prior serious felony (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)) and a prior\nstrike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (b)-(i), 1170.12).\n       In May 2021, the trial court declared a doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency\npursuant to section 1368 and suspended criminal proceedings. Defendant appealed the\ncourt\u2019s order, and in case No. C094429 this court dismissed the appeal after finding the\norder nonappealable.\n       In July 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s Marsden (People v. Marsden\n(1970) 2 Cal. 3d 118) motion. Defendant appealed in case No. C094612; this court\ndismissed the appeal after concluding defendant appealed from a nonappealable order.\n       In September 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to be heard on a\nmotion to suppress given that criminal proceedings remained suspended.\n       In October 2021, the trial court found defendant incompetent to stand trial.\nDefendant appealed in case No. C095200, and, after examining the notice of appeal, this\ncourt dismissed the appeal as premature.\n       In November 2021, the trial court committed defendant to Napa State Hospital for\ntreatment for no more than two years. At that time, the court found defendant had the\ncapacity to accept or refuse medication. Defendant appealed the order in case No.\nC095417. Because defendant was later restored to competency and the matter was\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fresolved by plea, this court dismissed the appeal from the court\u2019s November commitment\norder.\n         After some initial delay, by June 2022, defendant had been transported to Napa\nState Hospital. During a medication review hearing in July 2022, an administrative law\njudge found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant lacked the capacity to make\ndecisions regarding antipsychotic medication, that his mental disorder required treatment\nwith antipsychotic medication, and without such treatment it was probable that serious\nphysical or mental harm would result. The administrative law judge ordered that the\nhospital could involuntarily medicate defendant until August 16, 2022, but that any\ninvoluntary medication beyond that date required a court order.\n         In an August 4, 2022, report under section 1370, subdivision (b)(1), a forensic\npsychologist opined that defendant was not yet competent to stand trial and should be\nretained for further treatment; defendant repeatedly declined to be interviewed.\nAccording to the report, defendant met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders \u2013 Fifth Edition (DSM V) criteria for having unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder. He suffered from a history of delusions and\nparanoid ideation. The role of substance abuse in exacerbating defendant\u2019s symptoms\nwas unclear. He admitted regularly using cannabis, alcohol, and ecstasy for extended\nperiods of time since his youth, and stated he had experimented with cocaine and\nVicodin, but denied using Ayahuasca and became guarded in his response. More\ninformation was needed to diagnose him with a substance use disorder.\n         The report detailed previous evaluations, which found defendant repeatedly denied\nhaving any mental health issues and concluded that he did not appear to have the capacity\nto discuss the alleged offenses in a rational or coherent manner; his ongoing psychotic\nprocesses continued to impair defendant\u2019s ability to engage in a reality-based, organized,\nmeaningful discussion about his legal case and decisional considerations. Defendant\u2019s\nnumerous writings to the court exhibited persecutory delusions, including that he had\n\n                                              3\n\fbeen targeted by a white supremacist military and Christian cartel, that he believed the\njudge falsely imprisoned him based on his refusal to interview, and that the public\ndefenders were colluding to keep him locked up, and grandiose delusions, including that\nhe is an \u201cindependent regulator of Ayahuasca temples in the U.S., and is exempt from\nfollowing the law.\u201d\n       The Department of State Hospitals subsequently petitioned the court for an\ninvoluntary antipsychotic medication order under section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(D)(iv).\nThe petition similarly alleged that defendant required the administration of antipsychotic\nmedication because he lacked the capacity to make medication decisions, his mental\ndisorder required medical treatment with antipsychotic medication, and without such\ntreatment serious harm to defendant\u2019s mental or physical health was probable.\n       At the hearing on the petition, Dr. Ahmed, a Napa State Hospital psychiatrist who\nhad worked with defendant for about six weeks and had treated defendant with\nantipsychotic medication for approximately 10 days to two weeks following the\nadministrative law judge\u2019s temporary order, testified defendant was currently diagnosed\nas schizophrenic with an unspecified psychosis disorder. Defendant\u2019s symptoms\nincluded paranoid ideation; he believed that the judge and his attorney had conspired\nagainst him, and he refused to be evaluated for treatment or engage in therapy sessions.\nHe also refused to meet with an assigned social worker with the name \u201cChristian.\u201d\n       Dr. Ahmed had assessed approximately 500 patients for involuntary medication\norders over the past seven years. He opined that defendant was not aware of his\npsychiatric illness, and that he was unable to evaluate the benefits and risks of taking\nantipsychotic medication. Defendant lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions, and, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, there were no other treatment options\navailable to treat paranoia.\n       At a continued hearing on August 18, 2022, Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant\u2019s\nparanoia impacted his mental health by causing him to isolate and not engage in any\n\n                                              4\n\ftreatment or evaluations, or to utilize any mental competency material. Defendant\nexposed himself to other patients that were more severely mentally ill, which concerned\nDr. Ahmed because defendant seemed unable to stop himself which could lead to\ndangerous situations. Defendant distrusted his treatment team, the nurses, and refused to\ncommunicate with a staff member named Christian. In Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, defendant\nwould refuse to take the needed medication unless court ordered.\n       Treating defendant with antipsychotic medication, according to Dr. Ahmed, would\nreduce his mental health symptoms, improve his insight and judgment, and allow him to\nregain competency; without treatment, defendant\u2019s symptoms would continue to worsen.\nMedication would also improve defendant\u2019s daily living and his interactions with his\npeers and treatment staff.\n       Defendant was currently being treated with a small dose of antipsychotic\nmedication, and although Dr. Ahmed had not seen a huge improvement, defendant was\nable to better tolerate longer conversations. It generally took about 90 days to reach\ntherapeutic levels that helped alleviate mental health symptoms.\n       Because the medicine could have adverse side effects such as constipation,\nstomach pains, and weight gain, patients were routinely monitored to manage potential\neffects. While defendant claimed the medication caused high blood pressure, Dr. Ahmed\ntestified that defendant\u2019s blood pressure was normal and would be monitored.\n       Defendant allegedly objected to being involuntarily medicated based on religious\ngrounds. Dr. Ahmed, however, testified that defendant had never told him that the reason\nhe did not want to take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever\ntalked to Dr. Ahmed about his religious beliefs.\n       Defendant testified on his own behalf. He had been sadhu, or a self-appointed\nmonk, since 2005, which is why he isolated from others. He studies Kabbalah literature.\nHe testified that his objection to taking medication was because he could only be\ndependent on \u201cthe deity.\u201d\n\n                                             5\n\f       When asked whether his exercise of free religion included not having mind-\naltering substances, defendant responded, \u201cno.\u201d He explained that he already used\npsychotropic substances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the\n\u201cgodhead\u201d or \u201csuper soul,\u201d the \u201chigher deity.\u201d The drugs that defendant took worked like\npeyote, expanding defendant\u2019s mind and \u201cinvad[ing] [his] free will.\u201d\n       Defendant had been taking the oral antipsychotic medication after the temporary\norder because he did not want to be forcibly injected. He believed the medication was\nharming his short-term memory and killing his brain cells. According to defendant, he\nwas not required to participate in therapy, and he was not incompetent. Defendant denied\nhaving schizophrenia.\n       During closing remarks, defense counsel argued the People failed to satisfy the\nSell (Sell v. United States (2003) 539 U.S. 166) factors for involuntarily medicating a\ndefendant for the purpose of restoring him or her to competency. The court took the\nmatter under submission.\n       The next day, the trial court granted an order authorizing involuntary medication.\nThe court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant\nlacked the capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and if his\nmental disorder was not treated, serious harm to his physical or mental health would\nprobably result.\n       Based on Dr. Ahmed\u2019s testimony, the court found that the purpose of the\nmedication was not only to restore defendant to competency but also to improve his daily\nliving, interactions, and insight, including participation in therapeutic programs. Thus,\nthe court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument based on Sell. In any event, even if the\nonly reason for the medication was to restore competency, the court found the People had\nmet their burden of satisfying the Sell factors, including that (1) defendant was charged\nwith a serious crime against a person; (2) involuntary medication of antipsychotic\nmedication was substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial;\n\n                                             6\n\f(3) the medication was unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the defendant\u2019s\nability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the\nconduct of a defense in a reasonable manner; and (4) that less intrusive treatments were\nunlikely to have substantially the same results and antipsychotic medication was in the\npatient\u2019s best interest in light of his medical condition. Defendant timely appealed the\ninvoluntary medication order.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Appointed counsel filed an opening brief setting forth the facts of the case and\nasking this court to review the record and determine whether there are any arguable\nissues on appeal. (Conservatorship of Ben C., supra, 40 Cal.4th 529.) Defendant was\nadvised by counsel of the right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days of the date of\nfiling the opening brief.\n       Defendant filed a supplemental brief. As best we can understand, defendant\nclaims he was raised inside of a government-police syndicate or cult that engaged in\nAryan catholic abuse. His first key memory at age five, which was installed by the\nparens patriae syndicate in Simi Valley, locked his brain \u201cto Mikal high priest and to\ngreyskull,\u201d defendant\u2019s name in the \u201cGod-circuit,\u201d and since then, his mind was\npermanently chained to the memory, and consequently, \u201csusceptible to it as an inroad on\nthe security of his mind and his God-circuit, and to create a mind-war cycle in the brain\nthat goes on and on, an intended eventual schism of the brain\u2014crossed [third] eye, to\nmake a caduceus, all-seeing eye, occult doctrine.\u201d He alleges that a government project\nknown as \u201c \u2018project stargate\u2019 \u201d makes \u201cpuppet-ziggurats, including with Ayahuasca\nwhich was introduced to [defendant] in 2005 by the syndicate, and is engaged nationally\nin a \u2018mind-war\u2019 \u201d somehow involving defendant\u2019s religion \u201ccult of Santo Daime\u201d and the\n\u201c \u2018God Shiva.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       As best we can discern, defendant\u2019s supplemental brief raises numerous issues that\nare not cognizable in this appeal from the involuntary medication order, and we do not\naddress them. Such matters include issues related to the following: a 2009 criminal\nprosecution in Massachusetts and a previous schizophrenia diagnosis in that case; alleged\nInternal Revenue Service claims of charity fraud against two Ayahuasca-based charities\nin Oregon and what defendant characterizes as \u201cfederal government stalking\u201d; a\ndiscontinuation of \u201cPUA funds\u201d and ordered repayment of funds previously disbursed;\nthe propriety of an alleged warrantless search under the Fourth Amendment and being\nlocked out of three consecutive locations in Mount Shasta; an attack by armed persons on\nhis campsite in February 2021; whether the state willfully prosecuted defendant under a\ndifferent name other than his monk\u2019s moniker and correct name \u201cSiva de Simon\nGreyskull Black\u201d; violation of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery\nand involuntary servitude; whether state actors or governmental departments exercised a\ngovernment-orthodoxy religion; and the validity of his plea.\n       Furthermore, to the extent defendant failed to appeal from the underlying\njudgment following his plea, defendant \u201ccannot now be permitted to make a direct attack\nupon his convictions\u201d or the plea. (People v. Webb (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 410; see\nalso \u00a7 1237, subd. (a) [an appealable judgment is generally rendered at the time of\nsentencing]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.308(a) [a notice of appeal must be filed within 60\ndays after the judgment or order being appealed to confer appellate jurisdiction].) Thus,\nissues that could have been raised in an appeal from the judgment on his criminal\nconvictions, but which were not because defendant failed to timely appeal, are also not at\nissue in defendant\u2019s present appeal.\n       Turning to the involuntary medication order on appeal, defendant argues the order\nis void because it violated his religious beliefs. We disagree.\n       The United States Constitution and California Constitution prohibit involuntary\nmedication that burdens a patient\u2019s free exercise of religion, unless a compelling state\n\n                                             8\n\finterest outweighs the patient\u2019s interests in religious freedom. (U.S. Const., 1st Amd. &\n14th Amd.; Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 4; People v. Woody (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716, 718; State\nDept. of State Hospitals v. A.H. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 441, 446-447 (A.H.).) We review\nthe court\u2019s order for substantial evidence. (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 701;\nPeople v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314.)\n       Defendant bore the burden of showing that; (1) he sought to engage in the exercise\nof religion and (2) that the involuntary psychotropic medication order substantially\nburdened the exercise of his religion. (A.H., supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at pp. 445-446.)\nHere, there is no credible evidence that defendant\u2019s objection to the involuntary\nmedication order was based on a sincerely held religious belief or substantially burdened\ndefendant\u2019s exercise of his religion.\n       Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant never told him that the reason he did not want\nto take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever talked to Dr.\nAhmed about his religious beliefs. When asked whether his religious beliefs precluded\nhim from taking mind-altering substances like antipsychotic medication, defendant\nreplied that they did not. Instead, he testified that he already used psychotropic\nsubstances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the \u201cgodhead.\u201d Based on\nDr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s\nimplied finding that defendant could still practice his religion while simultaneously\ntaking antipsychotic medication, even if the medication was a different psychotropic\nsubstance than the one he readily admitted ingesting as part of his religion.\n       To the extent defendant contends the trial court made the involuntary medication\norder to punish him for not participating in mental health evaluations at Napa State\nHospital, essentially resulting in slavery, or that the judge simply wanted to \u201cwear [his]\nspirit\u201d like he was \u201ca god,\u201d nothing in the record supports such speculation. Dr. Ahmed,\nwho had assessed nearly 500 patients for involuntary medication orders over a seven-year\nperiod, testified that defendant suffered from schizophrenia and an unspecified psychotic\n\n                                              9\n\fdisorder, which resulted in significant delusions and paranoia that led defendant to act in\ndangerous ways. Dr. Ahmed explained that the only treatment for defendant\u2019s diagnosed\nmental illness, which defendant refused to acknowledge, was antipsychotic medication,\nand in the absence of such medication, defendant\u2019s symptoms would worsen over time.\nDefendant, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions.\n       In granting the involuntary medication order, the trial court carefully considered\nthe case files and the moving papers as well as Dr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony at\nthe hearing on the petition. After weighing the benefits and risks of taking the currently\nprescribed Zyprexa (Olanzapine), the court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision\n(a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant lacked the capacity to make decisions regarding\nantipsychotic medication, that his diagnosed mental disorder required treatment with such\nmedication, and if his mental condition was left untreated, it was probable that serious\nharm to defendant\u2019s mental health would result. On this record, we cannot conclude the\ncourt erred in so finding.\n       Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that sections 1369 and 1370\nunconstitutionally violate his right to defend himself or to a speedy trial. The claim is\nforfeited because defendant did not raise these specific objections below. (See e.g.,\nPeople v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 691 [defendant forfeited his claim that\nprosecutor\u2019s actions constituted an improper attempt to interfere with defendant\u2019s ability\nto exercise his constitutional right to \u2018compulsory process\u2019 by failing to raise a claim of\ncompulsory process violation in the trial court].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n     The order permitting involuntary antipsychotic medication is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              HULL, Acting P.

We find no other arguable error\nthat would result in a disposition more favorable to defendant and affirm the judgment as\nmodified.\n\n                      FACTS AND HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n       In July 2019, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 19-1220 (case\nNo. 1220) with two felonies: conspiracy to commit theft (Pen. Code \u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1),\n484, subd. (a), 487, subd. (a) & 488 [count 1], statutory section citations that follow are\nfound in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated); possession of a billy or blackjack\n(\u00a7 22210 [count 2]); and three misdemeanors: prohibited interception of public safety\ncommunication (\u00a7 636.5 [count 3]); resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\n(\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1) [count 4]); and possession of a smoking device (Health & Saf. Code,\n\u00a7 11364, subd. (a) [count 5]). Defendant was released on his own recognizance.\n       In March 2020, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 20-348 (case\nNo. 348) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), count 1\n[against M.M. with a baseball bat], count 3 [against L.S. with a baseball bat] & count 6\n[against E.L. with a motor vehicle]); three counts of assault by means likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4), count 2 [M.M.], count 4 [L.S.] & count 7 [E.L.]);\nfirst degree felony burglary with a nonaccomplice present (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 667.5, subd. (c)(21),\ncount 5); and possession of a deadly weapon, a crossbow, with the intent to assault\nanother (\u00a7 17500; count 8). For counts 1 and 2, it was alleged that defendant personally\ninflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)), and for counts 1 through 7 it was\nalleged that defendant was released from custody on bail or his own recognizance in case\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 1220 at the time of the offenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In April 2020, defendant was again\nreleased on his own recognizance.\n       This brief factual summary is based on the police reports, which the parties\nstipulated to as the factual basis for defendant\u2019s pleas.\n       The charges in case No. 348 stemmed from police reports that defendant struck\nE.L. with a vehicle as he was riding his gas-powered bicycle, which was later stolen, and\nthat defendant assaulted L.S. and M.M. with a bat because he believed they had stolen\nproperty belonging to defendant\u2019s deceased father.\n       In March 2021, while out of custody, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County\ncase No. 21-376 (case No. 376) with attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated\nmurder (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), count 1 [victims Jane Doe and John Doe]); shooting at an\noccupied vehicle (\u00a7 246; count 2); and possession of a billy or blackjack (\u00a7 22210, count\n3). For count 1, it was alleged that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a\nfirearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)) and personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)).\nThe trial court revoked defendant\u2019s release and issued a criminal protective order for the\nvictims in case No. 376.\n       Regarding the charges in case No. 376, the victim had reported being shot at while\ndriving from a casino where defendant had repeatedly threatened her; a red truck with a\ndriver resembling defendant had followed her and fired shots at her car as the truck\npassed. A later search of the suspect vehicle located a container with defendant\u2019s name\non it, documents with the name of the person who was with the victim when she made the\npolice report, binoculars, a methamphetamine pipe, and several weapons. Law\nenforcement opined that defendant intended to kill the victim because he believed she\nwas involved in his father\u2019s death and stole his property.\n       The People moved to consolidate case No. 376 (defendant\u2019s attempted murder\ncase) with two pending cases against defendant Justin Ritchison. The court denied the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fmotion without prejudice to refile it following the preliminary hearing, which was set in\nJune 2021.\n       In May 2022, defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Ahart, declared a conflict based on his\nprior representation of two adverse material witnesses in case No. 348. He asked to be\nrelieved and to have Mr. Magid appointed as defendant\u2019s counsel. The court granted\ncounsel\u2019s request.\n       In September 2022, defendant reached a global plea agreement resolving all three\ncases for a stipulated upper term sentence of 15 years in state prison. The parties agreed\nto amend the complaint in case No. 376 to strike the premeditation and deliberation\nallegations; add a firearm enhancement under section 12022.4, subdivision (a) to count 1;\nand added a stalking charge as count 4. The parties stipulated to the police reports for\neach incident as the factual basis for his pleas.\n       In case No. 376, defendant pleaded guilty\/no contest to one amended count of\nattempted murder (count 1) and one added count of stalking (\u00a7 646.9, count 4); admitted\nthe firearm enhancement added to count 1 (\u00a7 12022.4, subd. (a)); and admitted being\nreleased on bail or his own recognizance in case No. 348 and in case No. 1220 as to those\noffenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In case No. 348, defendant pleaded guilty\/no contest to one count\nof assault with a deadly weapon (count 1), which was amended to include all three\nvictims, admitted that he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon during the\noffense (making the offense a strike), and pleaded no contest to residential burglary with\na person present (count 5) as a strike offense (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(21)).\n       We note that defendant checked the \u201cguilty\u201d box on his plea form. However,\nduring the plea hearing, defendant orally pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d to count 1 (attempted\nmurder) and \u201cguilty\u201d to count 4 (stalking) in case No. 376, and \u201cno contest\u201d to assault\nwith a deadly weapon (count 1) and first-degree residential burglary (count 5) in case\nNo. 348.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Under the terms of the agreement, after the completion of sentencing, all counts in\ncase No. 1220 were to be dismissed with a Harvey waiver and any remaining counts in\ncase No. 376 and case No. 348 would also be dismissed. Defendant stipulated to\naggravating factors to support upper term sentences, including that there was a pattern of\nviolence of increasing seriousness and that he was released on bail or his own\nrecognizance at the time of the offenses.\n       In October 2022, the trial court sentenced defendant to the stipulated 15-year term,\nwhich included the upper term of nine years for the attempted murder offense, a\nconsecutive upper term of three years for the attached firearm enhancement, consecutive\nterms of one year each for the out on bail or own recognizance enhancements, and a\nconcurrent term of two years for the stalking offense in case No. 376. The court\nsentenced defendant to a consecutive one year (one third the midterm) for the assault with\na deadly weapon conviction and a concurrent upper term of six years for the residential\nburglary offense in case No. 348. The court also issued a criminal protective order under\nsection 640.9, subdivision (k) in case No. 376.\n       After imposing sentence, the trial court advised defendant that his incarceration\nwould be followed by either three years post release community supervision under\nsection 3450 or three years parole under section 3000, subdivision (b)(1).\n       The court imposed a $300 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4), and a $300 parole revocation\nrestitution fine (\u00a7 1202.45) in case No. 376 and case No. 348, which were suspended\nunless parole was revoked, a $40 court security assessment per conviction (\u00a7 1465.8), a\n$30 criminal conviction assessment per conviction (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373), and a $10\ncrime prevention fee plus penalty assessments (\u00a7 1202.5) in case No. 348.\n       In case No. 376, the court awarded 582 actual days of credit plus 86 days of\nconduct credit for a total of 668 credit days. In case No. 348, the court awarded one\nactual day of credit. At appellate counsel\u2019s request pursuant to People v. Fares (1993)\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f16 Cal.App.4th 954, the trial court corrected its credit calculation by awarding defendant\ntwo additional days of credit in case No. 376.\n       In February 2023, defendant submitted a pro. per. notice of appeal requesting a\ncertificate of probable cause. This court granted defendant\u2019s request for permission to\nfile a notice of appeal under the constructive filing doctrine. The trial court then filed the\nnotice of appeal without granting a certificate of probable cause in March 2023.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       We appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. Counsel filed an opening\nbrief setting forth the facts of the case and requesting that this court review the record to\ndetermine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal. (People v. Wende, supra,\n25 Cal.3d 436.) Defendant was advised of his right to file a supplemental brief within 30\ndays of the date of filing of the opening brief. More than 30 days elapsed, and we\nreceived no communication from defendant.\n       After examining the record, we have discovered a clerical error in the judgment.\nThe parties contemplated dismissal of the remaining counts and enhancements after the\nplea in case No. 376 and case No. 348 and dismissal with a Harvey waiver of all the\ncounts in case No. 1220 as part of the plea agreement. The prosecutor stated that the\nPeople would move to dismiss the remaining counts after sentencing was completed. The\ntrial court, however, inadvertently failed to discuss or otherwise address dismissal of the\nremaining charges in case No. 376, case No. 348, or case No. 1220 after sentencing\ndefendant.\n       As the \u201ccourt may not proceed as to the plea other than as specified in the\n[approved] plea\u201d (\u00a7 1192.5), it follows the trial court\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing\nregarding dismissal of the remaining charges was not an exercise of judicial discretion\nbut, rather, a clerical mistake in creating a record of the judgment. (In re Candelario\n(1970) 3 Cal.3d 702, 705.) Accordingly, we will modify the judgment to reflect the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdismissal of counts 2 and 3 plus attached enhancements in case No. 376 as well as counts\n2 through 4 plus attached enhancements in case No. 348 and all the charges in case\nNo. 1220 as contemplated by the parties. Because the abstract of judgment properly\nreflects defendant\u2019s pleas to attempted murder and stalking in case No. 376 and to assault\nwith a deadly weapon and residential burglary in case No. 348, and no other counts, the\nabstract of judgment need not be amended in this regard.\n       However, we have found two additional errors on the abstract of judgment that\nrequire correction. The abstract reflects a $39 probation revocation restitution fine\nimposed under section 12022.44 in case No. 348, which the trial court never orally\nimposed. And, although the trial court imposed a $30 criminal conviction assessment for\neach of defendant\u2019s four convictions under Government Code section 70373, for a total\nassessment of $120, the abstract erroneously reflects a $130 criminal conviction\nassessment. \u201cWhere there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment\nand the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls.\u201d\n(People v. Zackery (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 380, 385, citing People v. Mitchell (2001)\n26 Cal.4th 181, 185-186 [appellate court with jurisdiction can order correction of\nabstracts of judgment that do not accurately reflect the oral judgments of sentencing\ncourts].) We shall direct that the abstract be corrected accordingly.\n       We find no other arguable error that would result in a disposition more favorable\nto defendant.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to dismiss count 2 and count 3 in case No. 376 and any\nattached enhancements, counts 2 through 4 in case No. 348 as well as any attached\nenhancements, and all charges in case No. 1220. As so modified, the judgment is\naffirmed. The clerk of the superior court shall prepare a corrected abstract of judgment\nthat deletes the $39 fine under section 12022.44 for case No. 348 and reflects a $120\ncriminal conviction assessment pursuant to Government Code section 70373. The clerk\n\n                                             7\n\fshall forward a copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  HULL, Acting P.

Code,\n          1\n\u00a7 1172.6). Tapia and four codefendants\u2014Juan Rivera, Carlos Diaz, Guadalupe Vertiz,\nand Jorge Castro\u2014were convicted in 1998 of second degree murder for the stabbing\ndeath of Cesar Arroyo. The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition without\nissuing an order to show cause on the ground the record of conviction, including Tapia\u2019s\ntestimony, established beyond dispute that Tapia was the actual killer. We conclude the\ntrial court should have issued an order to show cause and conducted an evidentiary\nhearing and, therefore, reverse and remand for those purposes.\n\n\n                                          FACTS\nI. Attack and Killing of Arroyo\n              On March 14, 1996, at around 9:20 a.m., K.L., her boyfriend Cesar Arroyo,\nand her sister L.L. were walking northbound on Standard Street in Santa Ana on their\nway to a grocery store. A brown-colored car approached them from the opposite\ndirection, made a U-turn, and pulled up beside them. Rivera jumped out of the car and,\nwith a beer can in his hand, asked Arroyo, \u201c\u2018Where you from?\u2019\u201d Arroyo responded, \u201c\u2018I\ndon\u2019t claim.\u201d When Rivera asked him again, Arroyo insisted, \u201c\u2018Really I don\u2019t claim.\u2019\u201d\nRivera proclaimed, \u201c\u2018We\u2019re from Lopers,\u201d or \u201c\u2018big, bad Lopers\u2019\u201d and threw the beer can\nat Arroyo. K.L. interceded, and the beer can hit her on the head.\n              Tapia, Diaz, Vertiz, and Castro then jumped out of the car and with Rivera,\nstarted beating Arroyo. Arroyo, who was five feet 5 inches tall and weighed 131 pounds,\ndid not fight back. After a minute or two of being beaten, Arroyo fell to the ground\nagainst the fence. He tried to cover and protect himself while Tapia and his codefendants\n\n              1\n                 Effective June 30, 2022, Penal Code section 1170.95 was renumbered\nsection 1172.6, with no change in text (Stats. 2022, ch. 58, \u00a7 10). All statutory references\nare to the Penal Code.\n\n                                             2\n\fcontinued to assault him. They continued to kick and hit Arroyo for five to six minutes\n                        2\nas he lay on the ground. Tapia and Vertiz punched K.L. when she tried to pull them off\nof Arroyo.\n              At some point, Tapia stepped away and stood behind L.L. A few seconds\nlater, three of the defendants got back into the car while another stood at the back of the\ncar and waited. Arroyo managed to stand up. One defendant, identified as wearing a\nblue shirt and dark, square pants, went up to Arroyo and pushed him in the chest. Arroyo\nstarted walking, then stumbled and fell to the ground.\n              The defendant who pushed Arroyo walked back to the car and got in. Once\nall five were inside, they drove away.\n              L.L. went to seek help, and police officers arrived shortly thereafter.\nArroyo had been stabbed several times and later died from his wounds.\n              Police officers took K.L. and L.L. to a liquor store where the officers had\npulled over a car matching the description of the car the defendants were in. Tapia and\nhis four codefendants were inside the car. Both K.L. and L.L. identified Tapia as having\nparticipated in the attack on Arroyo.\n\n\nII. Arroyo\u2019s Autopsy\n              Joseph Halka, a pathologist for the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner,\nperformed an autopsy on Arroyo\u2019s body. Halka testified that Arroyo died from\nexsanguination (he bled to death) caused by a stab wound to the heart and left lung.\nHalka found a total of seven stab or slash wounds. The wound to the heart was caused by\na knife with a \u201ctwo-edged configuration,\u201d meaning it was sharp on both edges or sides.\nBefore Arroyo died, emergency surgery had been performed that altered \u201csome of the\n\n              2\n                K.L. testified that while Arroyo was on the ground the defendants hit and\nkicked him. L.L. testified that four of the five defendants \u201cpiled on\u201d Arroyo as he lay on\nthe ground and one defendant stood behind her.\n\n                                              3\n\fcontours\u201d of the wounds. The remaining knife wounds, including defensive slash and\n\u201cpunctate\u201d wounds, were nonfatal and could have been caused by either a two-edged\nknife or a one-edged knife. Arroyo also had bruises and contusions on his body.\n\n\nIII. Tapia\u2019s Police Interview and Trial Testimony\n               Police investigators interviewed Tapia early on March 15, 1996. Tapia\nadmitted that he and his fellow gang members had attacked Arroyo but repeatedly denied\nhaving used a weapon. Tapia told the investigators that, before the attack, \u201cthe other\nguys said, \u2018watch that guy,\u2019\u201d with reference to Arroyo. Diaz (the driver) stopped the car,\neveryone got out, and they started attacking Arroyo. When asked why Tapia attacked\nArroyo, Tapia responded, \u201cBut was very \u2014 if you see him in the street like that, you\u2019re\ngoing to figure he\u2019s a gang member, and you\u2019re going to stop him, and you\u2019re going to\nsay hey, you understand me?\u201d Tapia claimed he did not have any weapons and did not\nstab Arroyo.\n               At trial, Tapia testified he was the one who stabbed Arroyo and he had lied\nto police when he was arrested. He testified he did have a knife in his pants\u2019 pocket and\n                                                                                 3\nhad obtained the knife from work at a Del Taco, where he use it to cut up boxes. The\nknife was \u201cstraight\u201d (as opposed to being a folding knife), had a three-inch blade and a\nthree-inch handle, and was sharp on both edges. He did not have a sheath or pouch for\nthe knife but on March 14, 1996, he was wearing oversized pants with huge pockets that\ncould accommodate the knife. Tapia testified he had forgotten about the knife when he\nleft work at 4:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                 Payroll records for the Del Taco showed that Tapia had last worked there\non February 15, 1995. Tapia\u2019s father, who was the manager of the Del Taco, testified\nthat knives that were sharp on both edges were used at that Del Taco and that he had not\nseen such a knife at the store in March 1996.\n\n                                             4\n\f              Tapia testified that he and his codefendants did not have any discussion\nabout getting into a fight. Tapia had been drinking earlier that night and was drunk.\nTapia claimed that as the five drove past Arroyo he screamed, \u201cLittle Minnie Locotes\u201d\nand lifted his hand with five fingers outstretched at a 45-degree angle. The car made a\nU-turn and all five passengers got out of the car and attacked Arroyo. Tapia took out the\nknife and stabbed Arroyo. Tapia remembered stabbing Arroyo a few times. Tapia did\nnot remember how it happened because he was drunk and did not recall why he stabbed\nArroyo. When he realized he was stabbing Arroyo with a knife, Tapia got scared and ran\nback to the car. He did not think he had seriously injured Arroyo because Arroyo was\nstill standing and walking.\n              Tapia and his codefendants got back into the car and drove off. Later they\nreturned to the place where they had attacked Arroyo and saw an ambulance. They then\ndrove to a liquor store to buy more beer. Soon thereafter, they were stopped by police\nofficers and arrested.\n              At first, Tapia claimed that he could not remember what he did with the\nknife. But he then testified that he had tossed the knife out of the driver\u2019s side window\nwhile on the way to the liquor store. Tapia claimed none of his codefendants knew he\nhad a knife, that he had stabbed Arroyo, or that he had tossed the knife out the window.\n\n\n                                PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nI. The Jury Trial Leading to Tapia\u2019s Conviction for Second Degree Murder\n              Tapia and the four other defendants were charged by amended information\nfiled in 1997, with the murder of Arroyo. It was alleged the murder was committed for\nthe benefit of, at the direction of and in association with a criminal street gang.\n(\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)\n              In May 1998 Tapia and his codefendants were tried together by jury.\nOutside the jury\u2019s presence all defendants admitted that they were members of the\n\n                                              5\n\fLopers, that the Lopers was a criminal street gang, and any alleged crimes they were\nconvicted of committing had been committed for the benefit of the Lopers.\n              The jury was instructed on aiding and abetting, conspiracy, murder, express\nand implied malice, attempted murder, second degree murder resulting from an unlawful\nact dangerous to life, and the lesser included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon,\nsimple battery, and simple assault.\n              The jury convicted all defendants of second degree murder. The jury found\nthat Tapia had personally used a knife at the time of the commission of the murder.\n              The trial court sentenced Tapia to a term of 28 years to life in prison, which\nincluded a principal term of 15 years to life for murder, four years for enhancements, and\nnine years for other offenses not relevant here.\n              Tapia and the other defendants appealed. In an unpublished opinion, a\npanel of this court remanded for reconsideration of presentence custody credits award but\notherwise affirmed the judgment and sentence. (People v. Diaz et al. (Mar. 28, 2001,\nG023892).)\n\n\nII. Tapia\u2019s Petition for Resentencing\n              In April 2022, Tapia filed a petition for resentencing under section 1172.6.\nIn a written response, the prosecution argued the petition should be denied at the prima\nfacie stage because the record of conviction, based on the jury\u2019s true finding that Tapia\npersonally used a deadly weapon, established he was the actual killer.\n              Tapia, for whom counsel had been appointed, filed a brief in support of\nresentencing and argued that an order to show cause should be issued based on his\nallegations that he was eligible for relief. Tapia argued the jury\u2019s true finding that he\npersonally used a knife in the murder did not necessarily mean the jury had found he was\nthe actual killer because it could have found that he displayed the knife or struck the\nvictim with its butt end.\n\n                                              6\n\f              The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition at a hearing held on\nSeptember 8, 2022. Tapia filed a notice of appeal on the same day. About one month\nlater the trial court issued a statement of decision. The court found: \u201cThe record of\nconviction, including Petitioner\u2019s own testimony before the jury in this case conclusively\nshows that petitioner was the actual killer. [\u00b6] As the actual killer, petitioner would be\nguilty of murder under the current law and is ineligible for resentencing under Section\n1172.6.\u201d\n\n\n              PROCEDURE AND STANDARDS UNDER SECTION 1172.6\n               By legislation effective January 1, 2019, the Legislature amended the\nfelony-murder rule and eliminated the natural and probable consequences doctrine of\nliability as a basis for a murder conviction. (Stats, 2018, ch. 1015, \u00a7 2; see People v.\nReyes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 981, 984.) The latter result was accomplished by amending\nsection 188 to provide that, except in cases of felony murder, \u201cin order to be convicted of\nmurder, a principal in a crime shall act with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 188, subd. (a)(3).)\n              To obtain relief under section 1172.6, a petitioner must file in the\nsentencing court a petition alleging these three conditions have been met: (1) the\npetitioner was convicted based on a pleading \u201cthat allowed the prosecution to proceed\nunder a theory of felony murder, murder under the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine or other theory under which malice is imputed to a person based solely on that\nperson\u2019s participation in a crime\u201d (\u00a7 1172.6, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the petitioner was\nconvicted of murder or attempted murder (id., subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the petitioner could\nnot now be convicted of murder or attempted murder as those offenses are presently\ndefined (id., subd. (a)(3)).\n              If the petition satisfies certain technical requirements, then the trial court\nappoints counsel if the petitioner has requested counsel. (\u00a7 1176.2, subd. (b)(3).) Next,\n\u201cthe prosecutor shall file and serve a response,\u201d and \u201c[t]he petitioner may file and serve a\n\n                                              7\n\freply within 30 days after the prosecutor\u2019s response is served.\u201d (Id., subd. (c).) Once\nbriefing is completed, the trial court determines whether the petitioner has made a prima\nfacie case for relief. (Ibid.) If the court finds the petitioner has made a prima facie case,\nthen the court must issue an order to show cause. (Ibid.)\n                 In determining whether the petitioner has made a prima facie case for relief\nunder section 1172.6, the trial court\u2019s inquiry is limited: The court, accepting the\npetition\u2019s factual allegations as true, makes a \u201c\u2018\u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d\u2019\u201d whether the\npetitioner would be entitled to relief if those allegations were proven. (People v. Lewis\n(2021) 11 Cal.5th 952, 971 (Lewis).) \u201c\u2018\u201cIf so, the court must issue an order to show\ncause.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Ibid.) Within 60 days of issuance of the order to show cause, the trial court\nmust hold a hearing to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to relief. (\u00a71172.6,\nsubd. (d)(1).)\n                 If counsel is appointed and the parties are given the opportunity for\nbriefing, the trial court may rely on the record of conviction to determine whether the\npetitioner has made a prima facie case for relief under section 1172.6. (Lewis, supra, 11\nCal.5th at p. 957.) \u201cThe record of conviction may include the underlying facts as\npresented in an appellate opinion, the trial evidence, the jury instructions, and closing\narguments of counsel.\u201d (People v. Lopez (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 1, 13.) \u201cThe record of\nconviction will necessarily inform the trial court\u2019s prima facie inquiry under section\n[1172.6], allowing the court to distinguish petitions with potential merit from those that\nare clearly meritless.\u201d (Lewis, at p. 971.) \u201cIn sum, the parties can, and should, use the\nrecord of conviction to aid the trial court in reliably assessing whether a petitioner has\nmade a prima facie case for relief under subdivision (c) [of section 1172.6].\u201d (Id. at p.\n972.)\n                 \u201cIn reviewing any part of the record of conviction at this preliminary\njuncture, a trial court should not engage in \u2018factfinding involving the weighing of\nevidence or the exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 972.) \u201cWhile the\n\n                                                8\n\ftrial court may look at the record of conviction after the appointment of counsel to\ndetermine whether a petitioner has made a prima facie case for section [1172.6] relief, the\nprima facie inquiry under subdivision (c) is limited. Like the analogous prima facie\ninquiry in habeas corpus proceedings, \u2018\u201cthe court takes petitioner\u2019s factual allegations as\ntrue and makes a preliminary assessment regarding whether the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief if his or her factual allegations were proved. If so, the court must issue\nan order to show cause.\u201d\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018[A] court should not reject the petitioner\u2019s factual\nallegations on credibility grounds without first conducting an evidentiary hearing.\u2019\n[Citations.] \u2018However, if the record, including the court\u2019s own documents, \u201ccontain[s]\nfacts refuting the allegations made in the petition,\u201d then \u201cthe court is justified in making a\ncredibility determination adverse to the petitioner.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 971.)\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI. Standard of Review and Standard for Denying Relief Under Section 1172.6\n              The trial court denied defendant\u2019s resentencing petition on the ground\ndefendant had failed to make a prima facie case for resentencing relief. Denial of a\nresentencing petition at the prima facie stage is warranted only if the record of conviction\ndemonstrates the petitioner is ineligible for relief as a matter of law. (People v. Lopez,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.) That is a purely legal conclusion subject de novo review.\n(Ibid.)\n              \u201cA petitioner is ineligible for resentencing as a matter of law if the record\nof conviction conclusively establishes, with no factfinding, weighing of evidence, or\ncredibility determinations, that (1) the petitioner was the actual killer, or (2) the petitioner\nwas not the actual killer, but, with the intent to kill, aided, abetted, counseled,\ncommanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer in the commission\nof murder in the first degree, (3) the petitioner was a major participant in the underlying\nfelony and acted with reckless indifference to human life, or (4) the petitioner acted with\n\n                                               9\n\fmalice aforethought that was not imputed based solely on participation in a crime.\u201d\n(People v. Lopez, supra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.)\n\n\nII. Tapia Is Entitled to an Evidentiary Hearing\n              Tapia argues he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his resentencing\npetition because the record of conviction does not conclusively establish as a matter of\nlaw that he is ineligible for relief. Although Tapia testified he had stabbed Arroyo, Tapia\nargues that one or more of the jurors might have disbelieved that testimony, as well as his\ntestimony that he was not threatened by any codefendant, and found him liable under a\nnow impermissible theory, in particular, the natural and probable consequences doctrine.\nTapia contends the trial court engaged in factfinding by finding that he was the actual\nkiller.\n              We agree that the record of conviction does not conclusively establish that\nTapia is ineligible for relief. The jurors, who were instructed that they were \u201cthe sole\njudges of the believability of a witness,\u201d might have disbelieved Tapia\u2019s testimony. The\nprosecutor left open the possibility that Tapia was not the stabber. In closing, the\nprosecutor argued, \u201c[I]f you believe, as jurors, that one of the defendants was the stabber,\nwhich the evidence obviously shows, in fact, Mr. Tapia admitted being the stabber, but as\nyou will see when I go through the law dealing with group liability, which is the\nuncharged conspiracy or aiding and abetting, either of those theories, that the law holds\nall five defendants accountable even though only one of those defendants may be the\nstabber. The prosecutor also told the jury, \u201cWhoever the stabber was, whether you\nbelieve it was Mr. Tapia, as he said, or it\u2019s one of the other defendants, that person\nclearly acted with the express intent to kill.\u201d (Italics added.)\n              The jury\u2019s true finding on the knife-use enhancement does not conclusively\nestablish that Tapia was the stabber. The jury was instructed on personal use of a deadly\nor dangerous weapon and in that instruction was told \u201cthe term \u2018personally used a deadly\n\n                                              10\n\for dangerous weapon,\u2019 as used in this instruction, means the defendant must have\nintentionally displayed a weapon in a menacing manner or intentionally fired it or\nintentionally struck or hit a human being with it.\u201d That instruction did not require the\njury to find that Tapia stabbed Arroyo and killed him in order to return a true finding.\nIndeed, the verdict returned by the jury did not even find that Tapia had used a knife in\nthe commission of the murder: The verdict on the dangerous weapon enhancement states\nonly that the jury found that Tapia \u201cpersonally used a deadly or dangerous weapon,\nto-wit: KNIFE, at the time of the commission of the offense alleged in COUNT 1\n[murder].\u201d (Italics added.) The jury might have found that Tapia brandished the knife,\ndelivered the nonfatal stabs, or used the knife for a purpose unrelated to the murder at the\ntime the offense was committed.\n              At trial, the prosecutor argued strenuously that all defendants were guilty of\nmurder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. Without factfinding, the\nrecord does not foreclose the possibility that Tapia was convicted under that doctrine.\n              Given the record of conviction, and Tapia\u2019s testimony in particular, it might\nseem unlikely that the jury found anybody other than Tapia to be the actual killer.\nTapia\u2019s trial testimony, if believed, would be substantial evidence that Tapia was in fact\nthe actual killer. But such a credibility determination would be inappropriate at the prima\nfacie stage because the record does not positively refute the allegations of Tapia\u2019s\nresentencing petition. (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 971.) At the prima facie stage, the\nstandard is that the record of conviction must conclusively establish that Tapia is\nineligible for relief as a matter of law. We cannot say it does. An evidentiary hearing is\ntherefore in order.\n              Our opinion should not be read as indicating whether the trial court should\ngrant or deny Tapia resentencing relief. Exercising de novo review, we conclude only\nthat Tapia has met his burden of making a prima facie case for relief under section\n1172.6, subdivision (c).\n\n                                             11\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n              The postjudgment order is reversed and the matter is remanded with\ndirections to the trial court to issue an order to show cause and conduct an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n\n                                                 SANCHEZ, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nBEDSWORTH, ACTING P.

The trial court granted\nDefendant summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed. We conclude\nthe error in one of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings was\nharmless, and there were no triable issues of fact as to\nDefendant\u2019s liability. We affirm.\n       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nI.     Facts\n       At approximately 7:23 p.m. on March 6, 2019, Plaintiff\nwalked through the main entrance of the restaurant to purchase\nsome dinner to take home. It had been raining that day. Just\ninside the main entrance, Plaintiff wiped her shoes on a rubber\n\u201canti-slip\u201d floor mat. Plaintiff then turned to her left and walked\ntoward the rest rooms located down a hallway near a side door\nentrance to the restaurant. As she approached the women\u2019s rest\nroom at approximately 7:24 p.m., Plaintiff slipped and fell on the\nfloor between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s rest rooms. Plaintiff\nscreamed.\n       Plaintiff does not know what caused her to slip and fall.\nThe hallway had adequate lighting that night. While on the floor\nafter her fall, Plaintiff did not see anything that she believed\nmade her fall. Plaintiff never advised Defendant\u2019s employees of\nany substance on the floor that she believed had caused her to\nslip.\n       At approximately 7:22 p.m., two minutes prior to Plaintiff\u2019s\nfall, Oscar Hernandez, the restaurant\u2019s assistant manager, made\nhis way to the men\u2019s rest room. En route, Hernandez inspected\nthe hallway floor outside the men\u2019s and women\u2019s rest rooms.\nHernandez saw no liquids, debris, or foreign substances on the\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\ffloor. If he had, Hernandez would have instructed another\nemployee to clean up such materials, or would have immediately\ndone so himself.\n       Two minutes after entering the men\u2019s rest room,\nHernandez heard screams and exited to find Plaintiff on the\nhallway floor he had just inspected. Hernandez saw no liquids,\ndebris, or foreign substance on the floor where Plaintiff fell.\n       No surveillance video footage was produced showing the\nhallway outside the rest rooms where Plaintiff fell on the night of\nMarch 6, 2019. Both parties produced still photographs from\nsurveillance videos and the surveillance videos depicting the area\nimmediately inside both the main entrance and the side door. 1\nThe still photographs were time and date stamped from 7:14 p.m.\nto 8:43 p.m. that night.\nII.    Procedural Background\n       In November 2020, Plaintiff sued Defendant for premises\nliability. Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that while in the\nDefendant\u2019s restaurant, she \u201cslipped and fell on a slippery\nsubstance\u201d and was injured due to Defendant\u2019s negligence.\n       Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing there\nwere no triable issues of material fact that prior to Plaintiff\u2019s slip\nand fall, Defendant had no actual notice of any dangerous\ncondition on the hallway floor and had no reasonable time to\ndiscover and correct any such hazard. The motion was supported\nby a declaration from Hernandez, the surveillance videos and still\nphotographs, and excerpts from Plaintiff\u2019s deposition.\n\n\n      1 The CD\u2019s of the surveillance videos are not part of the\nrecord on appeal and the Internet link to them has expired.\nHowever, the still photographs are part of the record.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f       Along with her opposition, Plaintiff submitted a declaration\nby a \u201csafety and liability expert,\u201d Eris J. Barillas (Barillas), who\nopined that \u201cDefendant\u2019s failure to properly maintain the walking\nsurfaces in the dining room in combination with Defendant\u2019s\npractice of allowing trash to accumulate and overflow from the\ntrash receptacles onto the floor, thereby contaminating the floor\nsurface, was the cause of Plaintiff\u2019s fall and resultant injuries.\u201d\nThe declaration was accompanied by the still photographs from\nthe restaurant\u2019s surveillance videos. Additional Plaintiff\u2019s\nexhibits were excerpts of Hernandez\u2019s and Plaintiff\u2019s depositions.\nPlaintiff also filed evidentiary objections to Hernandez\u2019s\ndeclaration.\n       Defendant filed a reply and evidentiary objections to the\ndeclaration of Plaintiff\u2019s expert.\n       Following a hearing, the trial court granted Defendant\nsummary judgment. Citing Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26\nCal.4th 1200 (Ortega) and Girvetz v. Boys\u2019 Market, Inc. (1949) 91\nCal.App.2d 827, the court explained Defendant could be liable for\npremises liability only if the restaurant had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d\nof the \u201calleged dangerous condition.\u201d The court ruled there were\nno triable issues of material fact as to whether the restaurant\nhad constructive notice of any liquids, debris or foreign\nsubstances on the floor because it was undisputed that\nHernandez had inspected the hallway area between the rest\nrooms just two minutes before Plaintiff\u2019s slip and fall. \u201cA period\nof two minutes is too short of a time to require Defendant to have\ndiscovered the condition and remedied it, and thus to establish\nconstructive notice.\u201d\n       Following the entry of judgment, Plaintiff filed this timely\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f                            DISCUSSION\nI.     Trial Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings Were Partially\nIncorrect, but Harmless\n       As a threshold matter, Plaintiff contends the trial court\nerroneously excluded portions of the declaration of Plaintiff\u2019s\nexpert, Barillas. Although the standard of review for evidentiary\nrulings on summary judgment has yet to be settled by our\nSupreme Court, we side with the majority rule and review such\nrulings for an abuse of discretion. (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2023)\n87 Cal.App.5th 939, 946 & fn. 3.)\n       The trial court excluded two categories of information set\nforth in Barillas\u2019s declaration\u2014namely, (1) Barillas\u2019s recounting\nof Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony that Plaintiff saw an \u201coily\ncontaminant\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d on the floor when she fell, on the\ngrounds that this recounting ran afoul of People v. Sanchez (2016)\n63 Cal.4th 665 (Sanchez) and (2) five other portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration, on unspecified grounds. Because Plaintiff did not\nask the trial court to clarify the grounds for excluding the second\ncategory of statements, and because Plaintiff mistakenly argues\non appeal that they were excluded on Sanchez grounds, only the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling on the first category is properly before us on\nappeal.\n       The trial court erred in excluding the portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration that merely recounted Plaintiff\u2019s deposition\ntestimony, but that error was harmless. Sanchez provides that\nan expert may rely on inadmissible hearsay in forming an\nopinion, but may not relay that hearsay unless it is otherwise\nadmissible in evidence. (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 685\u2013\n686.) Although a party\u2019s deposition testimony admitted for its\ntruth constitutes hearsay when offered by that party at trial, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fnot hearsay when offered by that party on a motion for summary\njudgment\u2014where a party\u2019s deposition functions as their in-court\ntestimony. (E.g., Guthrey v. State of California (1998) 63\nCal.App.4th 1108, 1119\u20131120.) Thus, Barillas\u2019s recitation of\nPlaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony did not run afoul of Sanchez. As\nexplained below, however, this error was harmless because\nneither Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony nor Barillas\u2019s expert\nopinion relying upon that testimony creates a triable issue of fact\nas to whether Defendant had constructive notice of the substance\nPlaintiff saw on the ground.\nII.   Summary Judgment Law\n      Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no triable\nissues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c);\nRegents of University of California v. Superior Court (2018) 4\nCal.5th 607, 618.) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018 \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision\nde novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and\nopposing papers except that to which objections were made and\nsustained.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We liberally construe the evidence in\nsupport of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve\ndoubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Hampton v. County of San Diego (2015) 62 Cal.4th 340, 347.)\n      A defendant moving for summary judgment has the initial\nburden of presenting evidence that a cause of action lacks merit\nbecause the plaintiff cannot establish an element of the cause of\naction or there is a complete defense. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th\n826, 853.) If the defendant satisfies this initial burden, the\nburden shifts to the plaintiff to present evidence demonstrating\n\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fthere is a triable issue of material fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar, at p. 850.)\n III. Premises Liability Law\n       The elements of a premises liability claim are the same as\nthose of a negligence claim: \u201ca legal duty of care, breach of that\nduty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.\u201d (Kesner v.\nSuperior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158.) \u201c[L]andowners are\nrequired \u2018to maintain land in their possession and control in a\nreasonably safe condition\u2019 [citation], and to use due care to\neliminate dangerous conditions on their property.\u201d (Taylor v.\nTrimble (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 934, 943\u2013944; accord, Ortega,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205 [\u201cIt is well established in California\nthat although a store owner is not an insurer of the safety of its\npatrons, the owner does owe them a duty to exercise reasonable\ncare in keeping the premises reasonably safe\u201d].) \u201cA store owner\nexercises ordinary care by making reasonable inspections of the\nportions of the premises open to customers, and the care required\nis commensurate with the risks involved.\u201d (Ortega, at p. 1205.)\n       \u201c \u2018On the issue of the fact of causation, as on other issues\nessential to the cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff, in\ngeneral, has the burden of proof. The plaintiff must introduce\nevidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that\nit is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a\ncause in fact of the result. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] In the context of a\nbusiness owner\u2019s liability to a customer or invitee, speculation,\nand conjecture with respect to how long a dangerous condition\nhas existed are insufficient to satisfy a plaintiff's burden.\u201d\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at pp. 1205\u20131206; accord, Peralta v.\nThe Vons Companies, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1030, 1035.)\n\u201cBecause the owner is not the insurer of the visitor\u2019s personal\n\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fsafety [citation], the owner\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of\nthe dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability.\u201d\n(Ortega, at p. 1206; accord, Peralta, at p. 1035; Girvetz v. Boys\u2019\nMarket, Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.2d at p. 829 [a store owner is \u201cnot\nan insurer of the safety of [its] patrons\u201d].) Moreover, \u201cwhere the\nplaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to\nprove the owner\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of\nshowing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time\nto correct it.\u201d (Ortega, at p. 1206.)\n       Where, as here, there is \u201cno evidence of the source of the\ndangerous condition or the length of time it existed,\u201d a store\nowner\u2019s \u201cfailure to inspect the premises within a reasonable\nperiod of time\u201d creates an \u201cinference that the defective condition\nexisted long enough for a reasonable person exercising ordinary\ncare\u201d to have constructive notice of that condition (which, in turn,\nconstitutes evidence that the owner breached its duty of care).\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1203; Moore v. Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 472, 477.) What is a \u201creasonable\nperiod of time\u201d depends on the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d of each\ncase. (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1207.)\nIV. No Triable Issue of Fact as to Constructive Notice\n       A.     Defendant\u2019s Initial Burden\n       We independently agree with the trial court that Defendant\ncarried its initial burden of establishing the restaurant had no\nconstructive notice of any liquids, debris, or foreign substances on\nthe floor where Plaintiff fell, and thus did not breach its duty of\ncare to Plaintiff. No one knew the origin of any substance that\nPlaintiff claimed had caused her to slip and fall. Nor did anyone\nknow how the purported substance was transported there.\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f       Although Barillas\u2019s acknowledged these facts in her\ndeclaration, she nonetheless suggested\u2014in the admissible\nportions of her declaration\u2014that the incident was caused by\noverflowing trash receptacles inside the main entrance and food\nspilled on the floor that Plaintiff had traversed. As the trial court\ndetermined, the theory that Plaintiff\u2019s fall was caused by debris\non the floor is speculative. None of the accompanying\nphotographs on which Barillas relies show the trash cans were\noverflowing or there was trash or food on the floor where Plaintiff\nwas seen walking. (Garibay v. Hemmat (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th\n735, 743 [expert opinions based on assumptions of fact with no\nevidentiary support are speculative and without evidentiary\nvalue and do not raise triable issues of fact]; Sanchez v. Kern\nEmergency Medical Transportation Corp. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th\n146, 155 [same].) Barillas\u2019s speculative opinion presents no\ntriable issue of fact.\n       More importantly, it is uncontroverted that Hernandez had\ninspected the very area in this case just two minutes before\nPlaintiff\u2019s slip and fall, which satisfies Defendant\u2019s initial burden:\nWhere a \u201cstore owner has taken care in the discharge of its duty[]\nby inspecting its premises in a reasonable manner, then no\nbreach will be found even if a plaintiff does suffer injury.\u201d\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1211.) This means the trial court\nproperly found Plaintiff\u2019s attack on Hernandez\u2019s credibility has\nno bearing on whether summary judgment is to be granted.\n\u201c[S]ummary judgment shall not be denied on grounds of\ncredibility.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7437c, subd. (e); Binder v. Aetna\nLife Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840 [\u201cThe trial court may\nnot weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact finder to\ndetermine whose version is more likely true. [Citation.] Nor may\n\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\fthe trial court grant summary judgment based on the court\u2019s\nevaluation of credibility\u201d].) Plaintiff\u2019s assertion to the contrary,\nthe court properly referenced and applied this rule of law.\nPlaintiff\u2019s challenge to Hernandez\u2019s credibility raises no triable\nissue of fact.\n       On de novo review, we also agree with the trial court\u2019s\nfinding that Hernandez\u2019s inspection of the area two minutes\nbefore Plaintiff\u2019s fall, combined with Plaintiff\u2019s testimony of not\nseeing anything on the floor before she fell negate an inference a\ndangerous condition existed long enough for the restaurant to\nreasonably discover it. (See Peralta, supra, 24 Cal.App.5th at p.\n1037 [trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of\nstore where clerk\u2019s sweep was recorded fewer than eight minutes\nbefore the plaintiff\u2019s fall, clerk did not see anything in his sweep,\nand the plaintiff admitted she did not see any substance on the\nfloor before or after her fall]; Girvetz v. Boys\u2019 Market, Inc., supra,\n91 Cal.App.2d at p. 831 [customer\u2019s fall on banana peel\nremaining on the floor for one-and-a-half minutes was\ninsufficient time for constructive notice].) Plaintiff did not\nestablish a triable issue of fact as to constructive notice.\nB.     Plaintiff\u2019s Consequent Burden\n       Plaintiff offers three arguments in response. First, the trial\ncourt \u201cshould have applied the holding in Scott v. Alpha Beta Co.\n(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 305, 310\u2013311 (Scott), a comparative\nnegligence case. In Scott, a store customer brought an action for\nnegligence alleging rainwater tracked onto a slippery interior\nfloor mat caused her to fall. (Id. at pp. 306\u2013307.) There was\nevidence the owner had sufficient notice of the dangerous\ncondition of the property. The owner knew it was raining, knew\ninvitees would be continuously entering the building while it was\n\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fraining and would track water onto the floor, and knew the floor\nwas slippery when wet and the mat collected water. (Id. at pp.\n307\u2013308.) There was also evidence the customer had failed to\nexercise due care for her safety. The customer had a \u201ctrick knee,\u201d\nwhich may have given out and caused her to fall, she wore house\nslippers into the store and might be expected to know the slippers\nwould remain wet when she reached the end of the floor mat, and\nshe took no special precautions in stepping from the mat to the\nfloor. (Id. at p. 310.)\n       A jury found the store 60 percent negligent and the\ncustomer 40 percent negligent. (Scott, supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at\np. 306.) Both parties appealed, and the judgment was affirmed.\n(Id. at p. 311.) Scott is of no assistance to Plaintiff for many\nreasons. Chief among them is, unlike this case, the origin and\nnature of the dangerous condition\u2014a steady stream of rainwater\non an already slippery floor and wet floor mat\u2014was clearly\nknown to the store. Here, neither the source nor location of the\nalleged substance was known to anyone before Plaintiff fell. This\ndistinction is made more obvious by Plaintiff\u2019s changing claims as\nto the nature of that substance\u2014trash or rainwater. We cannot\ninfer the existence of evidence from the absence of evidence.\n       Plaintiff further argues the question of causation is\ntypically one for the jury (Kaney v. Custance (2022) 74\nCal.App.5th 201, 212), thus rendering it inappropriate to grant\nsummary judgment. This is true. However, it is ultimately\nirrelevant where, as here, causation cannot be established by\nnonspeculative evidence (see Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 774), and there is no triable issue of fact as\nto the lack of constructive notice. Summary judgment is still\nappropriate where the \u201cfacts . . . are undisputed\u201d or where\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\freasonable minds can come to but one conclusion. (Ortega,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205.)\n       Finally, Plaintiff urges that the trial court erred in not\napplying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Because Plaintiff\nfailed to present, develop, and advance her legal argument\nregarding res ipsa loquitur before the trial court, she has forfeited\nthat argument on appeal. (See Bently Reserve LP v. Papaliolios\n(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 418, 435\u2013436 [failure to sufficiently raise\nan issue before trial court forfeits the issue on appeal]; Roman v.\nBRE Properties, Inc. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1040, 1056; Peart v.\nFerro (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 60, 70 [appellate court will not\nentertain potential theories that could create triable issues of fact\nunless presented, developed, and argued to the trial court].)\nMoreover, even if we were to consider Plaintiff\u2019s argument, we\nwould conclude it lacks merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\f                           DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.

(Strata) for employment-related claims.1 As the litigation was\nproceeding, counsel for Persky informed Strata that Persky had been able to\naccess at least one legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel regarding work related\nto Persky\u2019s lawsuit. Strata then filed a cross-complaint alleging that Persky\n\nhad violated Penal Code2 section 502, which prohibits unauthorized access to\ncomputers, computer systems, and computer networks, by allegedly accessing\nStrata\u2019s \u201ccomputer network and file databases\u201d and viewing and obtaining\ndata contained within them, including the legal invoice. Persky filed an anti-\nSLAPP motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16), asserting that the claims in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint arose from Persky\u2019s protected activity involving the\nlitigation between the parties. The trial court denied the motion, concluding\nthat Strata\u2019s cross-claims against Persky are based on unprotected activity.\nWe agree and affirm the court\u2019s order.\n\n              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.   The Complaint and Cross-complaint\n\n      In April 2022, Persky filed his complaint against Strata, a real estate\ninvesting firm, alleging breach of his employment agreement and related\nLabor Code claims. At the time he filed the lawsuit, Persky was employed as\nthe Managing Director of Finance, and he continued to work in that role as\nthe litigation proceeded.\n      At some point after filing this action, Persky accessed Strata\u2019s\naccounting records through its computer network. Relevant to this appeal,\n\n\n1     Melissa Frerichs, another Strata employee, also joined Persky as a\nplaintiff in the lawsuit against Strata, but she is not a party to this appeal.\n2     Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n                                         2\n\fPersky is alleged to have reviewed documents in a corporate management file\ndatabase, one of which was a legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel related to\nPersky\u2019s action. At the time, Persky did not advise Strata he had looked at\nthe invoice. In late May 2022, Persky\u2019s lawyer informed Strata\u2019s counsel that\nPersky had accessed a legal invoice.\n      In June 2022, Strata filed a cross-complaint against Persky, alleging a\nsingle cause of action for the violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data\nAccess and Fraud Act, codified at section 502 of the Penal Code based on\nPersky\u2019s accessing of Strata\u2019s computer network and electronic files stored\n\nthere.3 It specifically referenced as the basis for relief three subdivisions of\nsection 502: (c)(1)(B), (c)(2), and (c)(7). The cross-complaint sought\ncompensatory damages, which included \u201call expenditures to investigate\nStrata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd.\n(e)(1)), as well as punitive damages (id., subd. (e)(4)), attorney fees (id., subd.\n(e)(2)), and other unspecified injunctive or equitable relief \u201cas the Court\ndeems just and reasonable\u201d (id., subd. (e)(1)).\n\nB.   Persky\u2019s Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      Persky filed a special motion to strike the cross-complaint under Code\nof Civil Procedure section 425.16. He asserted that Strata\u2019s cause of action\nfor a violation of section 502 arose from his protected activity because the\n\u201cgravamen of Strata\u2019s claim is that Persky impermissibly accessed Strata\u2019s\nfiles to communicate documents to his attorneys so that he could gain a\nlitigation advantage.\u201d Persky further argued that the \u201cclaim is premised on\ncommunications by Persky\u2019s counsel to Strata\u2019s counsel relating to a legal\n\n\n3      Strata alleged that Persky \u201cnavigated five (5) layers of folders outside\nof his [employment] purview and job responsibilities in order to access the\nfolder containing [Strata\u2019s attorneys\u2019] legal invoice.\u201d\n                                         3\n\finvoice that Strata had improperly made available to Persky and other\nemployees.\u201d\n      Persky\u2019s motion principally relied on the allegations in paragraphs 12,\n13, 18, and 19 of the cross-complaint. These allegations are as follows:\n          \u201c[W]ithout authorization, Mr. Persky has been rummaging\n          through Strata Global\u2019s network and databases, including\n          its corporate management database, to obtain information\n          and documentation, such as legal invoices, which Mr.\n          Persky knows are outside his permitted access for use\n          against Strata Global in this litigation.\u201d\n\n          \u201cAfter four months, on May 25, 2022, Strata Global\u2019s\n          counsel finally was advised by counsel for Mr. Persky that\n          Mr. Persky had gained access to EGS\u2019s legal invoices on\n          Strata Global\u2019s shared company server. Strata Global is\n          informed and believes and thereon alleges that Mr. Persky\n          accessed at least one legal invoice and viewed its contents.\n          Mr. Persky\u2019s counsel thereafter provide the file path for the\n          folder that Mr. Persky accessed.\u201d\n\n          \u201c[F]rom December 2021 to present, Mr. Persky has\n          knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer network and\n          file databases impermissibly to access, download, copy, or\n          otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\n          the company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2),\n          and 502(c)(7) of the Penal Code, Cal. Pen. Code, \u00a7 502(c), et\n          seq.\u201d\n\n          \u201cMr. Persky knowingly and willfully accessed confidential\n          and privileged litigation documents, taking the contents\n          therein in violation of Section 502(c)(2) of the Penal Code,\n          with malice and to irreparably harm the case for the\n          defense in this litigation.\u201d\n\n      With respect to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Persky\nargued that the litigation privilege barred Strata\u2019s claim, making it\nimpossible for Strata to establish a probability of prevailing on its cause of\naction.\n                                        4\n\fC.   Strata\u2019s Opposition\n\n      In response to Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, Strata primarily argued\nthat the conduct by Persky forming the basis for its cross-complaint was not a\n\u201c \u2018written or oral statement or writing\u2019 \u201d in an official proceeding. Rather,\naccording to Strata, the conduct underlying its claims was Persky\u2019s\n\u201caccessing, viewing, and taking privileged and confidential data from Strata\nGlobal\u2019s network . . . , not his discussions with counsel.\u201d Strata specifically\ndisclaimed that the cross-complaint included any allegation founded on\nPersky\u2019s \u201cintention to communicate any stolen data to his attorneys,\u201d\ncontrary to Persky\u2019s argument otherwise.\n      Strata also asserted that, to the extent the burden was shifted to Strata\nto demonstrate its cross-complaint had minimal merit, it could show a\nprobability of success on the merits. Strata maintained that Persky\u2019s status\nas an employee of Strata at the time of the alleged unlawful access to the\ncomputer network and databases did not bar its claim under section 502 as a\nmatter of law. It also contended that the litigation privilege did not apply\nbecause its cross-complaint was \u201cnot premised on Mr. Persky\u2019s\ncommunication to his attorneys,\u201d but was instead \u201cpremised entirely on his\nconduct in illegally accessing\u201d Strata\u2019s computer network and files.\n      Strata filed the declaration of one of its attorneys of record, Eric\nLandau, who provided further definition for the factual basis of Strata\u2019s\ncross-claims. Landau stated that on May 25, 2022, he received an email from\nPersky\u2019s lawyer \u201cstating that one of his clients accessed a litigation invoice\nfrom [Strata\u2019s counsel of record] pertaining to this action on [Strata\u2019s]\nNetwork.\u201d Landau inquired as to which plaintiff had gained access and how\nthe access had been gained. Counsel indicated that Persky had accessed the\ninvoice through an \u201cAccounts Payable folder.\u201d Landau initiated an\n\n                                        5\n\finvestigation into the matter on Strata\u2019s behalf, which included interviews of\nrelevant Strata employees. Strata filed the cross-complaint against Persky\non the basis of its preliminary investigation, but at the time of the filing of\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, Strata\u2019s investigation was still \u201congoing,\u201d and it had\nhired a digital forensics expert to assist in the investigation. Landau\nindicated that individuals from his office had \u201cspent approximately 25 hours\u201d\ninvestigating the matter at the time of filing the opposition to Persky\u2019s anti-\nSLAPP motion.\n      Strata also submitted a declaration from Rezlyn Palma, its Chief\nAccounting Officer. Palma explained that Strata uses a \u201cshared folder\nsystem to save files for documents related to\u201d its corporate operations.\nTypically, Strata saves invoices and proof of payment as a single .pdf file,\nwhich is then saved in subfolders representing the month and year in which\nthe invoice was paid, which are themselves saved within subfolder after\nsubfolder, all of which are located within the general \u201cAccounting\u201d folder.\nThe invoice and proof of payment that Persky accessed had been saved in this\nmanner.\n      Finally, Strata submitted a declaration from David Thompson, a digital\nforensics investigator hired by Strata to investigate Persky\u2019s \u201ccomputer\nactivities . . . in the Strata Global network and company database.\u201d\nThompson \u201cwas able to determine to a reasonable degree of professional\ncertainty that\u201d Persky used his Strata desktop computer to \u201caccess[ ] and\nopen[ ]\u201d the .pdf document containing the legal invoice and proof of payment\nthat was stored on Strata\u2019s network. At the time Persky accessed the file, the\ninvoice and proof of payment had been saved \u201cwithin five layers of sub-\nfolders.\u201d Thompson indicated that he had spent more than 60 hours on his\ninvestigation, and that his rate was $350 per hour.\n\n\n                                        6\n\fD.   Hearing on the Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      The trial court provided the parties with a tentative ruling in which it\nindicated an intent to deny Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court noted\nthat the basis for Strata\u2019s sole cause of action was the allegation that \u201cPersky\nallegedly improperly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer data,\u201d and that any\nallegations about the type of data that was accessed, how that data may have\nbeen used, and\/or with whom the data may have been shared was\ninformation that was not necessary for Strata to succeed on its cause of\naction.\n      At oral argument, counsel for Persky began by noting that Strata had\nset out three violations of section 502, under three different subdivisions of\nthe statute, and that each claim should be \u201cevaluated separately for purposes\nof the anti-SLAPP motion.\u201d Specifically, counsel noted that, at least with\nrespect to a claim for relief under subdivision (c)(1)(B), the provision requires\nthat the defendant \u201cdid something after\u201d accessing data\u2014that is, the\ndefendant must have \u201caltered, damaged, deleted, or otherwise uses the data.\u201d\nShe noted \u201cthere is not a single allegation of Mr. Persky altering, damaging,\ndeleting or destroying any data,\u201d and that the \u201conly allegation Strata submits\nto support its section 502(c)(1)(B) claim is Mr. Persky\u2019s use of that data in\nthis litigation.\u201d Counsel asserted that, as a result, the allegations in\nparagraphs 12, 18, and 19, as well as the claim for a violation of subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) must be stricken.\n      In response to the argument by Persky\u2019s attorney, counsel for Strata\nasserted that Persky\u2019s application of the allegations of the complaint to a\nclaim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1)(B) was based on a too-limited\nreading of that provision. Strata\u2019s attorney explained that if subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) \u201cended with \u2018or otherwise uses any data,\u2019 \u201d then Persky\u2019s contention\n\n                                        7\n\fmight have some validity. But the subdivision instead continues beyond the\nword \u201cdata,\u201d and \u201csays \u2018or otherwise uses any data, computer, computer\nsystem, or computer network.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he explained, \u201c[t]he\nword \u2018use\u2019 is not limited to the use of the data, . . . but [is] expanded to both\nthe data, a computer system, and a computer network.\u201d Because the usage\nreferred to in subdivision (c)(1) may be done with respect to a computer\nsystem or network, it was not necessary for Strata to meet the \u201cuse\u201d element\nwith an allegation as to how any particular data may have been used in the\ncontext of the litigation between the parties.\n      Persky\u2019s attorney responded with an argument related to one she had\nposited in her demurrer papers. According to counsel, the phrase \u201cotherwise\nuses\u201d in subdivision (c)(1) of section 502 has been interpreted by at least one\nfederal district court as referring to conduct that is similar to the preceding\nlist of prohibited conduct\u2014i.e., some usage that is akin to \u201calter[ing],\n\ndamag[ing], delet[ing], [or] destroy[ing]\u201d the data.4 She therefore maintained\nthat, in order for the cross-complaint to set out a valid claim under\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B), the usage of a computer-related item referred to in the\ncross-complaint must be a reference to using the data itself improperly, and\ncould not refer to using a computer or computer network to access data.\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court confirmed its tentative\nruling denying Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court\u2019s written minute\norder provided its reasoning:\n\n\n\n\n4     In demurrer papers, Persky cited two federal district court decisions for\nthis proposition. (See Ticketmaster L.L.C. v. Prestige Entm\u2019t West, Inc.\n(C.D.Cal. 2018) 315 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1175 and McGowan v. Weinstein\n(C.D.Cal. 2020) 505 F.Supp.3d 1000, 1020.)\n                                         8\n\f         \u201cHere, the sole cause of action in the cross-complaint [ROA\n         # 31] alleges that Persky allegedly improperly accessed\n         Strata Global\u2019s computer data, in violation of the Penal\n         Code. The specific type of data, how it was used, and\/or to\n         whom the information was communicated are all facts that\n         might evidence the alleged violation, but are not necessary\n         for the claim to proceed.\u201d\n\nGiven its conclusion that the cross-complaint did not arise from protected\nactivity, the court declined to address the second anti-SLAPP prong.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Anti-SLAPP Framework\n\n      The anti-SLAPP statute, set out in Code of Civil Procedure section\n425.16, creates a summary-judgment-like procedure at the outset of a case to\nprotect litigants from meritless lawsuits that might chill the exercise of\nconstitutional rights to free speech and petition. (Wilson v. Cable News\nNetwork, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 883\u2013884.) Resolving an anti-SLAPP\nmotion involves two steps. The moving party bears the initial burden to\nestablish that the challenged causes of action arise from its protected speech\nor petitioning activity. (Id. at p. 884; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e) [listing four\ncategories of protected activity].) If the moving party carries its burden, the\nburden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate that its claims have at\nleast minimal merit. (Wilson, at p. 884.) \u201cOnly a cause of action that\nsatisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from\nprotected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP,\nsubject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29\nCal.4th 82, 89; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n      In meeting its prong one burden, \u201cthe moving [party] must identify the\nacts alleged in the complaint that it asserts are protected and what claims for\nrelief are predicated on them. In turn, a court should examine whether those\n                                         9\n\facts are protected and supply the basis for any claims.\u201d (Bonni v. St. Joseph\nHealth System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010 (Bonni).) \u201c[A] claim may be struck\nonly if the speech or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and\nnot just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act for which\nliability is asserted.\u201d (Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n(2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1060 (Park), italics added.) \u201cA claim arises from\nprotected activity when that activity underlies or forms the basis for the\nclaim.\u201d (Id. at p. 1062.) Only if the anti-SLAPP movant meets its prong one\nburden does the burden then shift to the opposing party to \u201cdemonstrate that\neach challenged claim based on protected activity is legally sufficient and\nfactually substantiated.\u201d (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396 (Baral).)\n      We review the grant or denial of an anti-SLAPP motion de novo. (Park,\nsupra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1067.) In appeals in which the inquiry focuses on prong\none, \u201c[w]e exercise independent judgment in determining whether, based on\nour own review of the record, the challenged claims arise from protected\nactivity.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cIn addition to the pleadings, we may consider affidavits\nconcerning the facts upon which liability is based. [Citations.] We do not,\nhowever, weigh the evidence, but accept [the pleading party\u2019s] submissions as\ntrue and consider only whether any contrary evidence from the [anti-SLAPP\nmovant] establishes its entitlement to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d (Ibid.)\nIn determining whether a claim or claims arise from protected activity, we\nconsider the elements of the claims, the actions alleged to establish those\nelements, and whether those actions are protected activities. (Bonni, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 1015.) If a cause of action is determined to involve both\nprotected and unprotected activity, the unprotected activity is disregarded at\nthe conclusion of the first stage of the anti-SLAPP analysis. (Baral, supra,\n1 Cal.5th at p. 396.)\n\n\n                                       10\n\fB.   Strata\u2019s cross-claims do not arise from protected activity.\n\n      As the party moving to strike, Persky bears the burden on prong one to\ndemonstrate that \u201c \u2018the challenged claim arises from activity protected by\n[Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16.\u2019 \u201d (Olson v. Doe (2022) 12 Cal.5th\n669, 678.) He alleges that Strata\u2019s cross-complaint asserts multiple claims\nagainst him, all of which arise from his protected activity under subdivisions\n(e)(1) and\/or (e)(2) of section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nSubdivision (e)(1) protects \u201cany written or oral statement or writing made\nbefore a . . . judicial proceeding\u201d while subdivision (e)(2) protects \u201cany\nwritten or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under\nconsideration or review by a . . . judicial body.\u201d Strata does not appear to\ndispute that communications between Persky and his attorney regarding the\nlegal invoice at issue would constitute protected activity for purposes of the\nanti-SLAPP statute, but it denies that its claims against Persky arise from\nPersky\u2019s communications with his attorney.\n      In determining whether a party\u2019s claims arise from protected activity,\ncourts are to \u201cconsider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions\nby the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for\nliability.\u201d (Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1063.) The defending party\u2019s burden\nis to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those\nacts are protected under section 424.16. (Wilson, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 884.)\n      Although Strata drafted its cross-complaint as comprising a single\ncause of action, titled \u201cViolation of Comprehensive Computer Data and\nAccess Fraud Act (Cal. Pen. Code[,] \u00a7 502),\u201d a review of the allegations of the\ncross-complaint demonstrate that it has set forth at least three separate\nclaims for relief within that single cause of action. Specifically, Strata alleges\nthat Persky violated three separate subdivisions of section 502: (c)(1)(b),\n\n                                       11\n\f(c)(2), and (c)(7).5 While all of these subdivisions relate generally to the\nunauthorized accessing of computer networks or data, each subdivision sets\nout slightly different conduct as illegal, while often using similar or even\nidentical language. (See People v. Hawkins (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1440\n[\u201cthe statute describes a number of computer crimes in somewhat\noverlapping language\u201d].)\n      For example, subdivision (c)(1)(B) of section 502 makes it illegal to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ] any data, computer, computer system, or\ncomputer network in order to . . . wrongfully control or obtain money,\nproperty, or data.\u201d Subdivision (c)(2) makes it illegal for any person to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission take[ ], cop[y], or make[ ] use of\nany data from a computer, computer system, or computer network, or take[ ]\nor cop[y] any supporting documentation, whether existing or residing internal\nor external to a computer, computer system, or computer network.\u201d And\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes it illegal for one to knowingly and without\npermission access or \u201ccause[ ] to be accessed\u201d a computer or computer system\nor network. In other words, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) of section 502 do\nnot mandate that the accessing of the data, computer, computer system or\nnetwork be done without authorization. Instead they require that some\nadditional conduct have been done without authorization. In contrast,\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes the mere accessing of a computer, computer system\nor computer network illegal if it was done without authorization.\n\n\n5     Strata also alleges that it is continuing to investigate whether Persky\nalso violated subdivision (c)(4) of section 502 by having \u201caltered, damaged,\ndeleted, or destroyed any of Strata Global\u2019s other data without permission,\u201d\nbut the cross-complaint does not assert a claim for relief based on this\nsubdivision.\n                                       12\n\f      Because any violation of the various subdivisions of section 502 could\nprovide Strata with a basis for relief, we must examine Strata\u2019s claims under\neach subdivision to determine whether it arises from protected activity. As\nthe Supreme Court explained in Bonni, a court \u201cshould analyze each claim for\nrelief\u2014each act or set of acts supplying a basis for relief, of which there may\nbe several in a single pleaded cause of action\u2014to determine whether the acts\nare protected and, if so, whether the claim they give rise to has the requisite\ndegree of merit to survive the motion.\u201d (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1010.)\n      Persky initially argues that all three of Strata\u2019s claims for relief under\nsection 502 \u201carose from the alleged use of supposedly wrongfully procured\ndata in litigation.\u201d He further reasons that the \u201cdata\u201d wrongfully procured\nmust be the \u201clegal invoice,\u201d and that pursuant to the allegations of the cross-\ncomplaint, the only possible alleged \u201cuse\u201d of this invoice \u201crelates to Persky\nand his attorney\u2019s communications about the legal invoice.\u201d Just as he did in\nhis arguments before the trial court, Persky relies on four particular\nparagraphs in the cross-complaint to assert that the claims must arise from\nhis protected activity in communicating with his attorney about Strata\u2019s legal\ninvoice. According to Persky, that his communications with his attorney\nforms the basis of Strata\u2019s claims against him is particularly apparent from\nthe cross-complaint\u2019s allegation that \u201cPersky has knowingly accessed Strata\nGlobal\u2019s computer network and file databases impermissibly to access,\ndownload, copy, or otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\nthe company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2), and 502(c)(7) of\nthe Penal Code, Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 502(c), et seq.\u201d (Italics added.) He relies on\nadditional allegations that similarly attempt to explain why Persky accessed\nthe invoice. (Ante, p. 4.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f      While we appreciate the basis for the argument, we view these\nallegations and the claims in cross-complaint differently than Persky does.\nSpecifically, an examination of the elements of the claims at issue as well as\nthe relief sought by Strata makes it clear that Strata\u2019s claims are not\npredicated on Persky\u2019s asserted protected conduct \u2014i.e., his communications\nabout and\/or use of the legal invoice.\n      As an initial matter, it is readily apparent that Strata\u2019s claim for relief\nunder subdivision (c)(7) of section 502 cannot arise from Persky\u2019s conduct in\nsharing or discussing the legal invoice with his attorney. As previously\nnoted, subdivision (c)(7) proscribes the knowingly unauthorized accessing of a\ncomputer system or network. There is no need to demonstrate why the\ncomputer system or network was accessed. Thus, Strata need only allege and\nultimately prove that Persky knowingly accessed its computer system and\ndid so without permission. Nothing about these elements implicates\ncommunicative or other litigation-related conduct that could be considered\nprotected under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n      We also conclude that Strata\u2019s claims for violations of subdivisions\n(c)(2) or (c)(1)(B) of section 502 do not arise from Persky\u2019s protected activity.\nPersky appears to assume that Strata\u2019s claim under subdivisions (c)(1)(B)\nand (c)(2) are and can only be based on his accessing Strata\u2019s computer\nsystem to \u201cuse\u201d Strata\u2019s data\u2014in the form of the legal invoice\u2014to obtain an\nadvantage in his litigation against Strata. He states that the \u201cobvious and\nnecessary implication of [the] allegation [that Persky\u2019s counsel provided the\nfile path for the folder that Persky accessed] is that Persky communicated\nand conveyed the invoice to his counsel \u2018for use against [Strata] in this\nlitigation.\u2019 \u201d He then argues: \u201cThis would appear to be the \u2018use\u2019 upon which\nStrata predicated its section 502, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) allegations.\u201d\n\n\n                                         14\n\f\u201c[T]here is,\u201d in his view, \u201cno other use alleged in the Cross-Complaint, and\ncertainly no allegation that Persky altered, damaged, deleted, or destroyed\nthe invoice.\u201d (Italics added.) We disagree.\n      First, with respect to section 502, subdivision (c)(2), a violation occurs\nas soon as an individual \u201cknowingly access[es]\u201d a computer or computer\nsystem or network and then, without permission, \u201cdownload[s], cop[ies], or\notherwise take[s] or make[s] use of\u201d data. (Italics added.) The use of \u201cor\u201d in\nthe subdivision makes clear that only one of the listed activities must take\nplace\u2014either, the downloading, copying, taking or making use of data\u2014for a\nviolation to occur. Strata\u2019s cross-complaint specifically alleges that Persky\nviolated this subdivision by accessing Strata\u2019s computer network and\ndatabases, and without permission \u201cdownload[ing], copy[ing], or otherwise\ntak[ing]\u201d data that belonged to Strata. The allegation of Persky\u2019s motive\u2014\nthat he downloaded, copied or took the data for a particular purpose, i.e., \u201cfor\nhis own use in his lawsuit against\u201d Strata\u2014is unnecessary to the claim, as\nsubdivision (c)(2) does not require that the data be downloaded, copied, or\ntaken for any particular purpose. Thus, this aspect of the allegation merely\nprovides context as to Persky\u2019s possible reason for engaging in the activity\nthat constitutes the wrong complained of\u2014i.e., the accessing and\nimpermissibly downloading\/copying\/taking data\u2014but is not itself the\nactionable wrong and it is therefore not the subject of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute. (See Baral, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 394.)\n      The allegations regarding the damages Strata asserts that it suffered\nas a result of Persky\u2019s violative conduct further demonstrate that Strata is\nnot seeking recovery based on Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity, but is\ninstead claiming damages arising from Persky\u2019s noncommunicative conduct.\nStrata alleges that it has been damaged \u201cby the costs necessary to conduct\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion and the damages caused thereby, including [reasonable] attorneys\u2019\nfees arising therefrom,\u201d and further asserts that Persky\u2019s \u201cactions were a\nsubstantial factor in th[is] harm to Strata Global because, as a direct result of\nhis actions, Strata Global has been forced to divert other employees from\ntheir regular tasks and retain a computer forensic analysis firm to perform\nan internal investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion into Strata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\nfiles.\u201d Strata is not seeking damages related to any possible harm to its\nlitigation position as result of Persky\u2019s sharing the contents of the invoice,\nnor is it requesting any injunctive relief in connection with the Persky\n\nlitigation.6\n      We also conclude that, like Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(2) of\nsection 502, Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(1)(B) does not arise from\nprotected conduct. The elements necessary to set out a claim for a violation\nof subdivision (c)(1)(B) are three-fold: (1) the individual must \u201c[k]nowingly\naccess[ ] . . . any data, computer, computer system, or computer network\u201d;\n(2) the individual must \u201cwithout permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ]\u201d that same \u201cdata, computer, computer system,\nor computer network\u201d; and (3) the accessing and \u201calter[ing], damage[ing],\ndelet[ing], destroy[ing], or otherwise us[ing]\u201d of the \u201cdata, computer,\ncomputer system, or computer network\u201d must have been done for a specific\n\n\n6     In fact, the cross-complaint does not set forth an allegation that Persky\nshared the invoice itself, or any information contained within the invoice,\nwith his attorney. The cross complaint merely explains how Strata learned\nabout the allegedly unlawful conduct by asserting that Persky\u2019s attorney\nadvised Strata\u2019s counsel that Persky had \u201cgained access to\u201d legal invoices,\nand that the attorney \u201cprovide[d] the file path for the folder that Mr. Persky\naccessed.\u201d\n                                       16\n\fpurpose\u2014i.e., it must have been done \u201cin order to . . . wrongfully control or\nobtain money, property, or data.\u201d\n      Persky assumes that Strata is alleging that the basis for the first and\nsecond elements is his intentional accessing of Strata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d (i.e., the\ninvoice) and his unauthorized \u201cuse\u201d of that same \u201cdata.\u201d Persky again\nassumes that Strata\u2019s complaint must be read as alleging that he \u201cused\u201d\nStrata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d in his lawsuit, relying on the allegation that he downloaded or\ncopied the data \u201cfor use against [Strata] in this litigation.\u201d But we do not\nread Strata\u2019s cross-complaint this way, particularly when we consider the\nnature of the damages that Strata identifies in its pleading. Rather,\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B) may be satisfied not only by knowingly accessing \u201cdata,\u201d\nbut also by knowingly accessing a computer or computer system or network.\nAnd Strata is alleging that accessing a computer or computer system is\nprecisely what Persky did: \u201cMr. Persky knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s\ncomputer network and file databases.\u201d And the allegations in the cross-\ncomplaint further assert that Persky used the computer network and file\ndatabases to \u201cwrongfully . . . obtain . . . data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd. (c)(1)(B), italics\nadded). In other words, Strata is alleging that Persky knowingly accessed\nand then impermissibly used the computer network in order to wrongfully\n\nobtain (by downloading or copying) an electronic copy of the invoice.7 This\nunderstanding of the allegations of the cross-complaint is consistent with the\nlimited recovery Strata is seeking\u2014i.e., compensatory damages to recover the\ncosts involved in connection with investigating and repairing anything\n\n\n7      We do not decide whether such an allegation would\u2014or would not\u2014\nsuffice to state a claim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1), as that issue is\nnot before us. Rather, we are merely identifying the conduct underlying\nStrata\u2019s asserted claim under this subdivision for purposes of determining\nwhether the claim must be stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n                                         17\n\fdamaged as a result of Persky\u2019s intrusion into its confidential data files on its\ncomputer network.\n      We therefore agree with the trial court that none of Strata\u2019s claims\narise from Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity so as to be subject to an\nanti-SLAPP motion. Strata is instead seeking to hold Persky liable under all\nthree identified subdivisions of section 502 based on his unauthorized\naccessing and use of Strata\u2019s computer network. Because Persky did not\nmeet his prong one burden as to any of the claims for relief asserted in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint, the trial court properly denied his motion without\nreaching prong two. (Freeman v. Schack (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 719, 733.)\n\n                                DISPOSITION\n\n      The order denying the anti-SLAPP motion is affirmed. Strata is\nentitled to recover costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                             DATO, Acting P.

(the Corporation;\ncollectively, the Williams plaintiffs), appeal from an order of\ndismissal entered as to defendants Buchalter APC and Carol\nLucas (collectively, the Buchalter defendants) after the trial\ncourt sustained without leave to amend the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint. The Williams plaintiffs\nasserted causes of action for conspiracy to defraud, financial elder\nabuse, and declaratory relief against the Buchalter defendants\nbased on allegations that Lucas, an attorney and shareholder at\nBuchalter, conspired with Sevana Petrosian, who was Williams\u2019s\nbusiness partner and managed several medical clinics where\nWilliams conducted his medical practice, to deceive Williams into\nbelieving Buchalter represented him and to induce him to enter\ncontracts that allowed Petrosian to embezzle more than $11\nmillion dollars from the Corporation. In sustaining the\ndemurrer, the trial court found all claims against the Buchalter\ndefendants were barred by the one-year statute of limitations\ngoverning claims against an attorney \u201cfor a wrongful act or\nomission, other than actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 340.6, subdivision (a).2\n\n\n\n\n1     Williams died during the pendency of this appeal. On\nMay 12, 2023 we granted the motion of his widow Gail Dee Lew-\nWilliams to be substituted in place of Williams as his successor in\ninterest.\n2    All further undesignated statutory references are to the\nCode of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\f      On appeal, the Williams plaintiffs contend the one-year\nstatute of limitations under section 340.6, subdivision (a), does\nnot apply to their claims because the gravamen of their action is\nactual fraud. We agree the complaint sufficiently alleged the\nBuchalter defendants conspired to commit actual fraud, such that\nsection 340.6 does not apply and the Corporation\u2019s conspiracy\ncause of action survives demurrer. However, Williams\u2019s\nindividual conspiracy claim fails because, as alleged, only the\nCorporation was defrauded. Moreover, the complaint fails to\nstate claims for financial elder abuse and declaratory relief.\n      We reverse the order of dismissal and the order sustaining\nthe demurrer and direct the trial court to enter a new order\noverruling the demurrer to the Corporation\u2019s cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud and sustaining without leave to amend the\ndemurrer to the Corporation\u2019s remaining causes of action and\nWilliams\u2019s cause of action for conspiracy to defraud.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Complaint\n      The Williams plaintiffs filed this action on May 4, 2022\nagainst the Buchalter defendants and Petrosian, her associates\nSalina Ranjbar, Vana Mehrabian, and Staforde Palmer,\nPetrosian\u2019s wholly owned company Petrosian Esthetic\nEnterprises LLC (Petrosian Esthetic), and seven limited liability\ncompanies Petrosian formed to operate individual medical spas\nunder the name \u201cSEV Laser Aesthetics\u201d (the SEV companies;\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fcollectively, the Petrosian defendants).3 The complaint alleged\nsix causes of action, three of which were asserted against Lucas\nor the Buchalter defendants: the first cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud, the third cause of action for financial elder\nabuse, and the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief.4\n\n3      On September 22, 2021 the Williams plaintiffs filed a\npetition, including a draft complaint, seeking court approval to\nfile an action against the Buchalter defendants for civil\nconspiracy with a client pursuant to Civil Code section 1714.10.\n(Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Carol Lucas, et al. (Super.\nCt. Los Angeles County, 2021, No. 20STCP03133).) On February\n3, 2022 the trial court found the alleged conspiracy to defraud the\nWilliams plaintiffs arose from \u201ctransactional activities\u201d carried\nout by the Buchalter defendants and did not arise \u201cfrom any\nattempt to contest or compromise a claim or dispute\u201d within the\nscope of Civil Code section 1714.10, subdivision (a), and therefore\nthe Williams plaintiffs could file their complaint without\nobtaining court approval.\n4      The complaint also asserted causes of action for breach of\ncontract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nand conspiracy to defraud against one or more of the Petrosian\ndefendants. The allegations asserted against these defendants\noverlap with allegations by the Williams plaintiffs in the related\nactions Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Sevana Petrosian, et\nal. (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV14137) and\nWilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n(Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV15993).\n      The Buchalter defendants request we take judicial notice of\nthe Los Angeles Superior Court online case summaries for these\nrelated actions for the purpose of establishing the date on which\nthe actions were filed. The Buchalter defendants made a similar\nrequest in the trial court that the court take judicial notice of\nvarious pleadings in the related actions, but the court did not\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f       As alleged in the complaint, in late 2013 Williams and\nPetrosian entered into discussions for Petrosian to act as the non-\nmedical manager of medical spas where Williams would conduct\nhis practice. Williams was then 77 years old and in apparent\npoor health. Williams and Petrosian \u201cdecided to act through\ntheir respective corporations.\u201d Williams\u2019s longstanding\naccountant, Leila Aquino, met with Petrosian to discuss the\npreparation of a contract that would govern the parties\u2019\narrangement and suggested a few law firms to assist them.\nHowever, Petrosian stated she already had contacted a lawyer,\nlater identified as Lucas, \u201cwho agreed to represent both parties\nand prepare a contract that is fair to both parties.\u201d Petrosian set\nup a meeting with Lucas.\n       On April 12, 2014 Williams and Aquino met with Petrosian\nand Lucas at Buchalter\u2019s offices (April 12 meeting). Lucas did\nnot tell Williams that she did not represent him, nor did she ask\nhim if he was represented by counsel. Lucas\u2019s statements and\nconduct during the meeting led Williams and Aquino \u201cto believe\nPetrosian\u2019s representations to them, that Lucas represented both\nParties and prepared a fair contract.\u201d Lucas never disclosed that\nshe had been representing Petrosian for over a year.\n\n\n\n\nrule on their request. We deny the request to take judicial notice\nof any trial court records in the related actions because the\nrecords are not relevant to our resolution of this appeal. Because\nwe find the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 claims were filed within the\napplicable statute of limitations, we do not reach the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 arguments that the pleadings in the related actions\ncontain admissions bearing on accrual of the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      During the meeting, Lucas had in front of her a\n\u201cManagement Services Agreement\u201d that she referred to a few\ntimes. She briefly explained to Williams that the laws governing\nthe corporate practice of medicine prohibit non-physicians from\nowning a medical practice, and then she \u201cimmediately moved to\nconvince and advise Dr. Williams to grant [Petrosian Esthetic] a\npower of attorney and Petrosian the right to sign checks and to\npay bills,\u201d explaining this would be necessary for Petrosian\nEsthetic to operate a clinic, collect patient payments, and make\nbank deposits on behalf of Williams\u2019s medical practice. \u201cIn\nreliance on Petrosian\u2019s representation that Lucas represented\nboth Parties and prepared a fair contract, reinforced by Lucas\u2019s\nconduct and statements during the meeting,\u201d on April 12, 2014\nWilliams signed the management services agreement without\nreading it.\n      A copy of the executed management services agreement\nbetween the Corporation and Petrosian Esthetic was attached to\nthe complaint. The recitals state the Corporation \u201cdesires to\nengage the services of [Petrosian Esthetic] to perform certain\nnon-professional functions for [the Corporation], in order to\npermit [the Corporation] to concentrate its efforts on the\nPractice.\u201d\u2019 The \u201cPractice\u201d was defined as the provision of medical\ncosmetic services at medical spa locations in Glendale and West\nHollywood. Under the agreement, the Corporation appointed\nPetrosian Esthetic as its attorney-in-fact for a wide range of non-\nmedical functions, including collecting payments, making\ndeposits, and other banking functions on the account of the\nCorporation (including making payments to Petrosian Esthetic\nfor management services and expenses). Petrosian Esthetic was\nresponsible for providing numerous services on behalf of the\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fCorporation with respect to the practice, including accounting,\nfinancial, and legal services, the employment of non-physician\npersonnel, providing and maintaining furniture, fixtures and\nequipment, and marketing. The agreement also provided\nPetrosian Esthetic would sublease space to the Corporation.\nUnder the agreement, a copy of any notices served pursuant to\nthe agreement would be sent to the attention of Lucas at\nBuchalter\u2019s Los Angeles office.\n      The complaint alleged on information and belief that \u201cfrom\nthe onset Lucas knew of Petrosian\u2019s intent to own the Practice,\ntake all the profits and pay Dr. Williams some kind of salary and,\nupon termination of the agreement, Petrosian intended to take\nover the Practice,\u201d and Lucas drafted the management services\nagreement \u201cin a way to allow Petrosian to achieve her intended\nscheme.\u201d\n      Beginning in 2016 the medical practice expanded to seven\nnew clinic locations, and Lucas, on behalf of Petrosian, formed\nand registered the SEV companies, one for each new location.\nEach of the SEV companies then entered into a management\nservices agreement with the Corporation regarding Williams\u2019s\nmedical practice at the individual locations. Relying on\nPetrosian\u2019s representation that the seven management services\nagreement were identical to the April 12, 2014 management\nservices agreement and that they were prepared by Lucas,\nWilliams signed each agreement on behalf of the Corporation,\nagain without reading the agreements. Each of the management\nservices agreements provided that the respective SEV company\nwould be entitled to actual out-of-pocket costs in providing\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fmanagement services plus a management fee of 15 percent of\nthose costs.5\n       In January 2020 the Corporation received a tax form from\nits credit card processing company indicating the practice had\ncollected credit card payments exceeding $7.5 million in 2019,\nalthough in 2019 the Williams plaintiffs had only received\n$155,000 from the Petrosian defendants. Petrosian had claimed\nthe $155,000 was the net profit from operations. Williams was\nsurprised by the disparity and consulted an attorney in February\n2020. With the help of an accountant, Williams reviewed the\nCorporation\u2019s bank records and determined gross income to the\nCorporation during 2019 exceeded $10.2 million, with estimated\nprofits of about $6 million.\n       On February 17, 2020 the parties mutually agreed to\nterminate their relationship effective April 30, 2020. Following\nthe termination, Petrosian allegedly \u201ctook over\u201d the entire\npractice, including the equipment, patients and employees,\nwithout compensating Williams, and she denied Williams access\nto the clinics. The Petrosian defendants relied on a provision of\nthe management services agreements to claim ownership of the\npractice.6\n\n\n5     A copy of the October 29, 2018 management services\nagreement between the Corporation and SEV Laser Aesthetics-\nSan Jose, LLC was attached to the complaint as an example of\nthe post-2018 management services agreements the Corporation\nentered into with the SEV companies.\n6     Paragraph 4.8 of the management services agreement\nprovides, \u201c[Petrosian Esthetic] has the legal right to occupy the\nspace occupied by the Practice . . . and grants to [Corporation] the\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f        The Williams plaintiffs calculated that between January 1,\n2017 and March 31, 2020, the practice generated gross revenues\nof about $20 million, with estimated overhead of $8 million, but\nthey only received about $400,000 in purported net profits during\nthis period. The complaint alleges on this basis the Petrosian\ndefendants embezzled about $11.4 million from the Corporation.\n       Moreover, in early 2020 the Petrosian defendants withdrew\nabout $2.2 million from the Corporation\u2019s bank accounts,\nincluding more than $700,000 in cash withdrawals. In response\nto an inquiry from the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 attorney about the\nwithdrawals, Lucas stated the funds were charged by Petrosian\nas a \u201clicense fee,\u201d and Lucas produced a set of agreements\nexecuted in 2019 between the SEV companies and Petrosian\nEsthetic under which each SEV company licensed the intellectual\nproperty relating to the \u201cSEV Laser\u201d brand from Petrosian\nEsthetic. Williams was previously unaware of these agreements,\nunder which the Petrosian defendants collected $2.1 million a\nyear in intellectual property license fees.\n       Lucas denied ever representing Williams or the\nCorporation, and she denied preparing the management services\nagreements. Lucas also claimed Buchalter had never billed the\nCorporation for legal services. However, in 2017 Petrosian\nEsthetic paid nearly $8,000 to Buchalter, and in 2018 two of the\nSEV companies paid nearly $30,000 in \u201clegal fees\u201d to the firm.\nThus, \u201cLucas has been paid dozens of thousands of dollars every\nyear by the [p]ractice of Dr Williams, at the same time Lucas was\n\n\n\n\nright to use the Premises for the Practice for as long as this\nAgreement remains in effect (the \u2018Sublease\u2019).\u201d\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fconspiring with Petrosian against Dr. Williams and his\n[p]ractice.\u201d\n      The first cause of action for conspiracy to defraud sought to\nvoid the management services agreements based on Lucas\u2019s and\nPetrosian\u2019s false inducements to cause Williams to enter the\nagreements; damages exceeding $11 million for the\nembezzlement of Corporation funds pursuant to the agreements\nand the overbroad powers of attorney granted to the Petrosian\ndefendants therein; damages for the severe emotional distress\nWilliams suffered as a result of the defendants\u2019 scheme; punitive\nand exemplary damages based on the defendants\u2019 malice; and\nenhanced damages pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 15657.5.\n      The third cause of action for financial elder abuse pursuant\nto Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610 is based on the\nsame factual allegations regarding the Buchalter defendants\u2019\nconduct. The sixth cause of action for declaratory relief, although\nasserted against both the Buchalter defendants and the\nPetrosian defendants, alleges \u201c[a]n actual controversy exists\nbetween Plaintiffs and the [Petrosian defendants]. Plaintiffs\ncontend that the [Petrosian defendants] should be held liable for\nPlaintiffs losses of about $11.5 million. Plaintiffs also contend\nthat they own the Practice, the leases to the clinics, the\nequipment and the electronic communication, as well as the\nwebsite. Plaintiffs also contend that they are entitled to all the\nincome generated from the Practice since May 1, 2020.\nDefendants contend otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fB.     The Buchalter Defendants\u2019 Demurrer and the Trial Court\u2019s\n       Order\n       On July 15, 2022 the Buchalter defendants demurred to all\ncauses of action in the complaint. They argued the claims\nagainst them were barred under the one-year statute of\nlimitations in section 340.6, subdivision (a), which governs claims\n\u201cfor a wrongful act or omission, other than actual fraud, arising\nin the performance of professional services\u201d by an attorney. They\nasserted that, as alleged in the complaint, the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims accrued no later than February 17, 2020, when the parties\nagreed to terminate their relationship based on disputes over\npayments to the Corporation, but the claims against the\nBuchalter defendants were not filed until May 2022.\n       The Buchalter defendants also argued with respect to the\nconspiracy cause of action that the Williams plaintiffs failed to\nsufficiently allege the Buchalter defendants were aware of, or\nknowingly agreed to a \u201c\u2018common and unlawful plan\u2019\u201d to embezzle\nmoney from the Williams plaintiffs. Rather, \u201c[t]hey simply allege\nthat Buchalter performed legal services\u2014such as forming LLCs,\nparticipating in an exchange of information regarding a proposed\nbusiness arrangement during an April 12, 2014 meeting, and\ndrafting agreements\u2014for its client, Sevana Petrosian.\u201d\nMoreover, the \u201cagent\u2019s immunity rule\u201d shielded the Buchalter\ndefendants from liability for acts of misconduct performed as an\nagent of Petrosian, because the Buchalter defendants did not owe\nan independent legal duty to Williams, and further, their acts did\nnot \u201c\u2018go beyond the performance of a professional duty to serve\nthe client and [did not] involve a conspiracy to violate a legal duty\nin furtherance of the attorney\u2019s financial gain.\u2019\u201d In addition,\nWilliams\u2019s individual claim for conspiracy failed because the\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fcomplaint did not allege harm he suffered given that all of the\nfunds were allegedly embezzled from the Corporation.\n       Similarly, the complaint failed to state a cause of action for\nfinancial elder abuse because the complaint alleged\nembezzlement of money only from the Corporation, not from\nWilliams personally. Finally, the declaratory relief cause of\naction did not seek a declaration of rights to prevent a future\nbreach; rather, it sought redress for alleged past wrongs.\n       In their opposition, the Williams plaintiffs argued the\ncomplaint adequately alleged a conspiracy to embezzle funds, and\nthe Buchalter defendants were not insulated by the agent\u2019s\nimmunity rule because the complaint alleged tortious and\nfraudulent acts by Lucas that \u201cwent far beyond the performance\nof a professional duty to serve the client.\u201d (Capitalization\nomitted.) Financial elder abuse was actionable because Williams\nwas the sole shareholder of the Corporation, and \u201call the funds\ndeposited in the [the Corporation] were generated by his medical\npractice.\u201d The interests of Williams and the Corporation \u201cfully\ncoincide,\u201d and the two \u201cshould not be regarded as legally\ndistinct.\u201d Declaratory relief was proper because the complaint\nhad the prospective effect \u201cto stop any further misappropriation\nof the income\u201d from the medical practice. Finally, the one-year\nstatute of limitations in section 340.6 did not apply to the claims\nin the complaint because the complaint did not allege a cause of\naction for legal malpractice.\n       In their reply, the Buchalter defendants argued, in part,\nthat section 340.6 is not limited to claims for legal malpractice\nbut instead governs any claim, however styled, that depends on\nproof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fcourse of providing professional services, as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225 (Lee).\n       At the September 12, 2022 hearing on the demurrer, the\ntrial court announced its tentative ruling was to sustain the\ndemurrer without leave to amend.7 The court stated, \u201cI do think\nthe one-year statute of limitations applies based on the Lee\nversus Hanley case. And . . . according to your allegations you\ndiscovered the facts at the latest on February 17th of 2020, but\ndidn\u2019t file the suit until May 4th of 2022, which was over a year\nlater.\u201d After hearing argument of counsel, the court adopted its\ntentative ruling and sustained the demurrer to the causes of\naction for conspiracy, financial elder abuse, and declaratory relief\nwithout leave to amend.\n       On September 12, 2022 the trial court entered an order of\ndismissal in favor of the Buchalter defendants.

The Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the Demurrer Based\n       on the One-year Statute of Limitations Governing Attorney\n       Misconduct\n       Section 340.6, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part,\n\u201cAn action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,\nother than for actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services shall be commenced within one year after\nthe plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence\nshould have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or\nomission . . . .\u201d The Williams plaintiffs contend that contrary to\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply to their claims because the complaint alleges the Buchalter\ndefendants engaged in fraud and embezzlement. The Buchalter\ndefendants argue the claims against them arise solely from their\nperformance of legal services for their client, Petrosian, and the\n\u201cactual fraud\u201d exception in section 340, subdivision (a), does not\napply. The Williams plaintiffs have the better argument.9\n\n\n9     Because we find section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply, we do not reach the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 argument their\nclaims accrued later than February 2020 and were timely even\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f       In Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pages 1233 to 1236, the\nSupreme Court examined the scope of section 340.6,\nsubdivision (a), in considering whether the trial court properly\nsustained without leave to amend on statute of limitations\ngrounds the demurrer filed by an attorney (William Hanley) to\nthe complaint filed by his client (Nancy Lee) in an action to\nrecover unspent attorneys\u2019 fees where Lee alleged Hanley\nconverted the funds by refusing to return them after Lee\nterminated him. The Supreme Court held after examining the\nlegislative history that \u201csection 340.6(a)\u2019s time bar applies to\nclaims whose merits necessarily depend on proof that an attorney\nviolated a professional obligation in the course of providing\nprofessional services. In this context, a \u2018professional obligation\u2019 is\nan obligation that an attorney has by virtue of being an attorney,\nsuch as fiduciary obligations, the obligation to perform\ncompetently, the obligation to perform the services contemplated\nin a legal services contract into which an attorney has entered,\n\nunder a one-year limitations period. The statutes of limitations\napplicable here are all three years or longer: three years for\nconspiracy to commit fraud or embezzlement (\u00a7 338, subds. (c)(1),\n(d); see Filmservice Laboratories, Inc. v. Harvey Bernhard\nEnterprises, Inc. (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1297, 1309 [timeliness of\na civil conspiracy claim \u201cmust be determined by reference to the\nstatute of limitations applicable to the underlying cause of\naction\u201d]); four years for financial elder abuse (Welf. & Inst. Code,\n\u00a7 15657.7; Dennison v. Rosland Capital LLC (2020)\n47 Cal.App.5th 204, 212); and three or four years for declaratory\nrelief (Bank of New York Mellon v. Citibank, N.A. (2017)\n8 Cal.App.5th 935, 943 [\u201cA claim for declaratory relief is subject\nto the same statute of limitations as the legal or equitable claim\non which it is based.\u201d]). It is undisputed the complaint was filed\nwithin three years of accrual of the claims.\n\n\n\n                                 16\n\fand the obligations embodied in the Rules of Professional\nConduct.\u201d (Lee, at pp. 1236-1237.)\n      By contrast, the Lee court reasoned, \u201c[S]ection 340.6(a) does\nnot bar a claim for wrongdoing\u2014for example, garden-variety\ntheft\u2014that does not require proof that the attorney has violated a\nprofessional obligation, even if the theft occurs while the attorney\nand the victim are discussing the victim\u2019s legal affairs.\u201d (Lee,\nsupra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1237.) Moreover, section 340.6 does not\napply merely because an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201coccurs during\nthe period of legal representation or because the representation\nbrought the parties together and thus provided the attorney the\nopportunity to engage in the misconduct. . . . Nor does\nsection 340.6(a) necessarily apply whenever a plaintiff\u2019s\nallegations, if true, would entail a violation of an attorney\u2019s\nprofessional obligations. The obligations that an attorney has by\nvirtue of being an attorney are varied and often overlap with\nobligations that all persons subject to California\u2019s laws have. . . .\nFor purposes of section 340.6(a), . . . the question is whether the\nclaim, in order to succeed, necessarily depends on proof that an\nattorney violated a professional obligation as opposed to some\ngenerally applicable nonprofessional obligation.\u201d (Lee, at\np. 1238.)10\n\n10    The Supreme Court in Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at page 1236\nemphasized that section 340.6, subdivision (a), was designed \u201cso\nthat the applicable limitations period for such claims would turn\non the conduct alleged and ultimately proven, not on the way the\ncomplaint was styled,\u201d citing appellate decisions applying\nsection 340.6. subdivision (a), to malpractice-based claims against\nattorneys styled as claims for breach of fiduciary duty (e.g.,\nPrakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014)\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\f      Based on these principles, the Lee court held the trial court\nerred in sustaining the demurrer to Lee\u2019s complaint without\nleave to amend because although \u201cLee\u2019s allegations, if true, would\nshow that Hanley has violated certain professional obligations in\nthe course of providing professional services\u201d (and any claim\nbased on this violation would be time-barred), the complaint\ncould \u201calso be construed to allege a claim for conversion whose\nultimate proof at trial may not depend on the assertion that\nHanley violated a professional obligation. Thus, on at least one\nreasonable construction of the complaint, at least one of Lee\u2019s\nclaims is not time-barred.\u201d (Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 1229-\n1230; see id. at p. 1240 [\u201cOf course, Lee\u2019s allegations, if true, may\nalso establish that Hanley has violated certain professional\nobligations, such as the duty to refund unearned fees at the\ntermination of the representation (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct,\nrule 3-700(D)(2)), just as an allegation of garden-variety theft, if\ntrue, may also establish a violation of an attorney\u2019s duty to act\nwith loyalty and good faith toward a client.\u201d].)\n      The trial court here erred in finding the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Lee required application of section 340.6,\nsubdivision (a). The complaint, like the complaint in Lee, can be\nreasonably construed to allege Lucas violated obligations she\nowed to the Williams plaintiffs under California law not to\ndefraud them, and not simply her professional obligations as an\nattorney. The central allegations against the Buchalter\ndefendants are that Lucas \u201cknew of Petrosian\u2019s intent to own the\n\n223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1121-1122), malicious prosecution (e.g.,\nYee v. Cheung (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 184, 195-196), and breach\nof contract (e.g., Southland Mechanical Constructors Corp. v.\nNixen (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 417, 427).\n\n\n\n                                 18\n\fPractice, take all the profits and pay Dr. Williams some kind of\nsalary and, upon termination of the agreement, Petrosian\nintended to take over the Practice,\u201d and Lucas drafted the\nmanagement services agreement \u201cin a way to allow Petrosian to\nachieve her intended scheme.\u201d11 Specifically, Lucas knew\nWilliams had been misinformed by Petrosian that Lucas was\nrepresenting both parties, Lucas perpetuated the\nmispresentation during the April 12 meeting through her words\nand conduct, and she took advantage of the misrepresentation to\ninduce Williams to sign the management services agreements\nand to execute powers of attorney. Contrary to the argument by\nthe Buchalter defendants, the allegations that Lucas conspired\nwith Petrosian to deceive and defraud Williams go beyond the\nperformance of ordinary legal services.12\n\n\n\n\n11   Buchalter does not dispute its liability for Lucas\u2019s conduct\nunder principles of respondeat superior.\n12    The Buchalter defendants also argue that Williams\u2019s claims\nmust fail because the Buchalter defendants did not \u201cderive any\npersonal financial benefit from [their] legal work \u2018over and above\u2019\nand \u2018monetary compensation\u2019 that Buchalter received as payment\nfor professional services.\u201d But \u201c\u2018\u201c[i]t is not essential to liability\nthat the person charged with fraud should have received any\nbenefit therefrom.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Fort v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance\n(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 12, 19-20; accord, Lone Star Security &\nVideo, Inc. v. Bureau of Security & Investigative Services (2012)\n209 Cal.App.4th 445, 457.)\n\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f       Certainly, Lucas\u2019s alleged misconduct could constitute\nviolations of her professional obligations, \u201csuch as fiduciary\nobligations, the obligation to perform competently, the obligation\nto perform the services contemplated in a legal services\ncontract . . . and the obligations embodied in the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct\u201d (Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1237), and\nfurther, the misconduct occurred in the course of Lucas\u2019s legal\nrepresentation, which provided the opportunity to deceive\nWilliams (id. at p. 1238). But the Williams plaintiffs do not need\nto prove any professional violation to prevail. Rather, they have\nalleged a garden-variety fraudulent scheme. Indeed, the\ncomplaint would be essentially unchanged if Lucas were simply\nan actor who came to the April 12 meeting pretending to be a\nlawyer who would protect Williams\u2019s interests, while tricking\nWilliams into signing the agreement. This would be consistent\nwith the allegation in the complaint that Lucas\u2019s statements and\nconduct during the meeting led the Williams plaintiffs to believe\nshe drafted the management services agreement.\n       Moreover, as we discuss below, the first cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud adequately states a claim for intentional\nfraud; thus, even if the claim arose from the provision of legal\nservices, the claim falls within the \u201cactual fraud\u201d exception in\nsection 340.6. (See Quintilliani v. Mannerino (1998)\n62 Cal.App.4th 54, 69-70 [\u201cthe exception for actual fraud in\nsection 340.6 was intended to apply to intentional fraud, not\nconstructive fraud resulting from negligent misrepresentation\u201d];\naccord, Nguyen v. Ford (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 1, 17 [same].) The\nBuchalter defendants do not cite, and we are not aware of any,\ncase holding that an otherwise sufficient cause of action for\nintentional fraud by an attorney is subject to section 340.6\u2019s one-\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fyear statute of limitations. (Cf. Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1239\n[\u201cSection 340.6(a) applies to claims that necessarily depend on\nproof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the\ncourse of providing professional services unless the claim is for\nactual fraud.\u201d].)\n\nC.

To survive a\n\n\n\n                                 21\n\fdemurrer, a plaintiff must allege facts constituting each element\nof fraud with particularity. (Kalnoki v.

In Doctors\u2019 Co., the Supreme Court held that the\nclaimant, whose malpractice claims against his doctor were\nsuccessfully tried to a jury, could not state a claim against the\nattorney for the doctor\u2019s insurer and the insurer\u2019s expert for\nconspiring with the insurer to violate an Insurance Code\n\n\nwas representing him lacks sufficient particularity, standing\nalone, to allege the inducement element, it is sufficient in\ncombination with the allegation that Lucas falsely advised\nWilliams that he had to sign the management services agreement\nand powers of attorney for Petrosian to manage the practice.\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fprovision requiring good faith efforts to settle a valid claim\n\u201c[b]ecause the noninsurer defendants [(the attorney and expert)]\nare not subject to that duty [under the Insurance Code] and were\nacting merely as agents of the insurer \u2018and not as individuals for\ntheir individual advantage.\u2019\u201d (Doctors\u2019 Co., at p. 45.) But the\ncourt clarified, \u201cIt remains true, of course, that under other sets of\ncircumstances \u2018[attorneys] may be liable for participation in\ntortious acts with their clients, and such liability may rest on a\nconspiracy\u2019 [citations]. For example, an attorney who conspires\nto cause a client to violate a statutory duty peculiar to the client\nmay be acting not only in the performance of a professional duty\nto serve the client but also in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s own\nfinancial gain.\u201d (Id. at p. 46.) Also, a claim may lie \u201cagainst an\nattorney for conspiring with his or her client to cause injury by\nviolating the attorney\u2019s own duty to the plaintiff.\u201d (Id. at p. 47.)\n       Shortly after the Supreme Court decided Doctors\u2019 Co., the\nLegislature amended Civil Code section 1714.10 (setting forth\nprefiling requirements for certain claims against an attorney\nalleging a civil conspiracy with his or her client) to add\nsubdivision (c), which sets forth the two exceptions to the agent\u2019s\nimmunity rule articulated in Doctors\u2019 Co. and provides that they\nare likewise exceptions to the prefiling requirements for civil\nconspiracy claims. Under subdivision (c), the prefiling\nrequirements do not apply to a cause of action \u201cagainst an\nattorney for a civil conspiracy with his or her client arising from\nany attempt to contest or compromise a claim or dispute\u201d where:\n\u201c(1) the attorney has an independent legal duty to the plaintiff, or\n(2) the attorney\u2019s acts go beyond the performance of a\n\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\fprofessional duty to serve the client and involve a conspiracy to\nviolate a legal duty in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s financial\ngain.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.10, subd. (c); see Favila, supra,\n188 Cal.App.4th at p. 209.)14\n       The allegations of the complaint are sufficient to establish\nthe conspiracy claim is not barred by the agent\u2019s immunity rule\nbecause Lucas (and Buchalter) had an independent legal duty not\nto defraud Williams. As discussed, the complaint alleges Lucas\nschemed to defraud the Williams plaintiffs by her statements and\nconduct at the April 12 meeting, which led Williams to believe\nshe represented him and Petrosian, and she induced Williams to\nbelieve the management services agreement and broad powers of\nattorney were necessary for Petrosian Esthetic to operate the\nmedical clinic. \u201cIt is well established that an attorney has an\nindependent legal duty to refrain from defrauding nonclients.\u201d\n(Rickley v. Goodfriend (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1136, 1151 [Civil\nCode section 1714.10 did not apply because attorneys had an\nindependent legal duty to third parties when holding client funds\nin a trust account with respect to dispersal of the funds to the\nclients and third parties]; see id. at p. 1153 [\u201cA license to practice\nlaw does not shield an attorney from liability when he or she\nengages in conduct that would be actionable if committed by a\nlayperson.

Williams Fails To State an Individual Cause of Action for\n      Conspiracy To Defraud the Corporation\n      In their demurrer the Buchalter defendants argued, as they\ndo on appeal, that Williams cannot state an individual cause of\naction for conspiracy because the complaint does not allege any\nharm to him personally from the conspiracy: instead, the parties\nare alleged to have \u201cacted through their respective corporations,\u201d\nand all of the revenues and assets of the practice were taken from\nCorporation.15 The Williams plaintiffs did not address this\nargument in their opposition to the demurrer, and they do not\naddress it in their opening or reply briefs on appeal. They have\n\n\n15    The complaint includes a conclusory allegation that\nWilliams suffered \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d as a result of the\nBuchalter defendants\u2019 misconduct, seeking damages on that\nbasis. But there are no particularized allegations as to how the\nBuchalter defendants caused emotional distress and how the\ndistress manifested. In any event, the Williams plaintiffs do not\nargue the emotional distress allegation is sufficient to support an\nindividual claim.\n\n\n\n                                26\n\ftherefore forfeited this contention. (See Tiernan v. Trustees of\nCal. State University & Colleges (1982) 33 Cal.3d 211, 216, fn. 4\n[issue not raised on appeal \u201cdeemed waived\u201d]; Swain v.\nLaserAway Medical Group, Inc.

Although the trial court did not reach the issue,\nthe demurrer to Williams\u2019s individual cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud was properly sustained.

The Complaint Fails To State a Cause of Action for\n       Financial Elder Abuse\n       Financial elder abuse occurs when a person \u201c[t]akes,\nsecretes, appropriates, obtains or retains real or personal\nproperty of an elder,\u201d or assists in these activities, either \u201cfor a\nwrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both,\u201d or \u201cby undue\ninfluence.\u201d (Welf. & Inst.

An\n\u201c\u2018[e]lder\u2019\u201d is \u201cany person residing in this state, 65 years of age or\nolder.\u201d (Id., \u00a7 15610.27.)\n       The complaint fails to state a claim for financial elder\nabuse because it does not allege funds were taken from a person\nover 65\u2014as alleged, the unauthorized withdrawals, embezzled\nprofits, and misappropriated assets were all taken from the\nCorporation.16 \u201cIt is fundamental that a corporation is a legal\n\n16     There are circumstances in which the taking of property\nnot held directly by an elder may be actionable.

The Williams\nplaintiffs misapprehend the alter ego doctrine.\n       \u201c\u2018\u201cUnder the alter ego doctrine, . . . where a corporation is\nused by an individual or individuals, or by another corporation, to\nperpetrate fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other\nwrongful or inequitable purpose, a court may disregard the\ncorporate entity and treat the corporation\u2019s acts as if they were\ndone by the persons actually controlling the corporation.\u201d\u2019\u201d\n\n\na \u201c\u2018representative\u2019\u201d is narrowly defined as \u201ca person or entity that\nis either . . . : [\u00b6] (1) [a] conservator, trustee, or other\nrepresentative of the estate of an elder or dependent adult [or]\n[\u00b6] (2) [a]n attorney-in-fact of an elder or dependent adult who\nacts within the authority of the power of attorney.\u201d (Id.,\n\u00a7 15610.30, subd.

(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1517-1518.) \u201cThus,\nalter ego is used to prevent a corporation from using its statutory\nseparate corporate form as a shield from liability only where to\nrecognize its corporate status would defeat the rights and\nequities of third parties; it is not a doctrine that allows the\npersons who actually control the corporation to disregard the\ncorporate form.\u201d (Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995)\n35 Cal.App.4th 980, 994; accord, Butler America, LLC v. Aviation\nAssurance Co. LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 136, 147.)\n       As alleged, Williams and Petrosian \u201cdecided to act through\ntheir respective corporations,\u201d and the Buchalter defendants\nfraudulently induced Williams to enter into the management\nservices agreements and execute powers of attorney on behalf of\nthe Corporation. The Petrosian defendants withdrew money\nfrom the Corporation\u2019s bank accounts, overbilled the Corporation\nfor management services and reimbursements, and claimed\nownership of the Corporation\u2019s assets. The complaint does not\nallege the Corporation is Williams\u2019s alter ego, and the fact\nWilliams was the sole owner of the Corporation does not make\nthe Corporation his alter ego, let alone bring a corporation within\nthe scope of the elder abuse law.\n\nF.     The Complaint Fails To State a Cause of Action for\n       Declaratory Relief Against the Buchalter Defendants\n       \u201c\u2018A complaint for declaratory relief is legally sufficient if it\nsets forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy\nrelating to the legal rights and duties of the parties under a\nwritten instrument or with respect to property and requests that\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fthe rights and duties of the parties be adjudged by the court.\u2019\u201d\n(Market Lofts Community Assn. v. 9th Street Market Lofts, LLC\n(2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 924, 931.) \u201c\u2018Declaratory relief operates\nprospectively, serving to set controversies at rest. If there is a\ncontroversy which calls for a declaration of rights, it is no\nobjection that past wrongs are also to be redressed; but there is\nno basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are\ninvolved.\u2019\u201d (Baldwin v. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1978)\n79 Cal.App.3d 393, 407; accord, Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor &\nAssociates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1403.) The remedy of\ndeclaratory relief is unavailable where a \u201cplaintiff has a fully\nmatured cause of action for money, if any cause exists at all.\u201d\n(Jackson v. Teachers Ins. Co.

Employee\nPension Plan (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1497 [\u201cWhere, as\nhere, a party has a fully matured cause of action for money, the\nparty must seek the remedy of damages, and not pursue a\ndeclaratory relief claim.\u201d].)\n       The complaint alleges the Petrosian defendants, aided by\nthe Buchalter defendants, embezzled money from the\nCorporation and, after the April 30, 2020 termination of the\nrelationship, used the management services agreements to\nexclude Williams and take over the practice. The declaratory\nrelief cause of action alleges a controversy exists \u201cbetween the\nPlaintiffs and the Petrosian Defendants\u201d (a defined term in the\ncomplaint that does not include the Buchalter defendants)\nbecause the Williams plaintiffs contend they sustained losses of\n$11.5 million, they own the practice, including the leases,\nequipment, and intangible property, and they \u201care entitled to all\n\n\n\n\n                                30\n\fthe income generated from the [p]ractice since May 1, 2020,\u201d\nwhereas the defendants dispute those contentions.\n      The complaint therefore fails to allege an actual\ncontroversy respecting prospective rights between the Williams\nplaintiffs and the Buchalter defendants. The Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 alleged role in defrauding the Corporation may be\nredressed with damages. To the extent there is a prospective\ndispute about ownership of the practice and future revenues it\nmay generate, this dispute lies with the Petrosian defendants,\nnot the Buchalter defendants. There is no allegation the\nBuchalter defendants have asserted any interest in the practice\nand its assets.17\n\n                         DISPOSITION\n\n       The order of dismissal is reversed.

BACKGROUND\n\n       Mr. Vasquez-Castro is a citizen of Guatemala. He was born in Guatemala in\n\n July 1993. When Mr. Vasquez-Castro was approximately fifteen years old, his family\n\n asked whether he was willing to live and work with one of his brothers in the United\n\n States. Mr. Vasquez-Castro agreed to move, although he does not remember who\n\n brought him to the United States without inspection. Mr. Vasquez-Castro reportedly\n\n lived in Memphis, Tennessee, for three years before moving to Dodge City, Kansas,\n\n with his brother and his brother\u2019s family.\n\n       In 2017, Mr. Vasquez-Castro was convicted of attempted rape of his twelve-\n\n year-old niece. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in the instant case\n\n provides that, in April 2017, a faculty member at Dodge City Middle School\n\n contacted the police to report allegations of sexual assault made by a female student.\n\n According to an official affidavit, the defendant kissed his twelve-year-old niece on\n\n the mouth, tried to take off her shirt, touched her breasts, and touched her vagina\n\n beneath her clothing. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then bought the victim a cell phone and\n\n told her not to tell anyone about the incident. Mr. Vasquez-Castro was arrested and\n\n interviewed by the police, at which point he admitted to forcing a kiss on the victim,\n\n grabbing her by the arms, and holding her still, while he tried to lift her shirt. He\n\n stated he used his hands to feel the victim\u2019s belly, breast, and front torso, and\n\n subsequently touched the victim under her clothing, touching her breasts and vagina.\n\n He then digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina. He reported he gained an erection\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024       Page: 3\n\n\n\n from this, but let the victim go because he wanted to have sex with her and knew it\n\n was wrong.\n\n        Later, in November 2017, during an evaluation with the Kansas Department of\n\n Corrections, Mr. Vasquez-Castro denied the incident and stated he only gave the\n\n victim a cell phone. He admitted to telling the police he touched the victim in a\n\n sexually inappropriate manner, but stated he admitted to having done so because the\n\n police repeatedly asked him the same question and Mr. Vasquez-Castro thought that\n\n by admitting to the incident, the police would let him go. He alleged the victim\n\n engaged in sexual behavior with a friend with the same name as Mr. Vasquez-Castro.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro was charged with attempted rape in Kansas state court and\n\n pleaded no contest to the charge. The standard presumptive sentence for the offense\n\n was 59 months of incarceration. However, the court sentenced him to 48 months\u2019\n\n incarceration, departing downward based on the victim\u2019s request, Mr. Vasquez-\n\n Castro\u2019s age, and Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s criminal history. He was subsequently\n\n deported from the United States on October 21, 2020.\n\n        On October 8, 2022, United States Border Patrol agents found\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro, in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico, attempting to conceal\n\n himself. He admitted to being a citizen of Guatemala without legal authorization to\n\n enter or remain in the United States. Mr. Vazquez was charged with reentry of a\n\n removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). He entered a\n\n guilty plea.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024       Page: 4\n\n\n\n       The PSR calculated Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s total offense level as 13 and his\n\n criminal history category as III, resulting in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 18 to\n\n 24 months. Neither party objected to the PSR. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a low-\n\n end Guidelines sentence, or downward variance, asserting that such a sentence would\n\n be sufficient. The Government opposed Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s request and asked that\n\n the court sentence Mr. Vasquez-Castro at the high end of the Guidelines range. The\n\n district court notified the parties before sentencing that it was contemplating an\n\n upward variance.\n\n       The district court sentenced Mr. Vasquez-Castro on April 11, 2023. The court\n\n reiterated at the sentencing hearing that it was considering an upward variance. The\n\n Government stated its position that a high-end sentence of 24 months would be\n\n sufficient to protect the public and deter Mr. Vasquez-Castro from returning to the\n\n United States again. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a sentence on the lower end or\n\n below the Guidelines range, arguing through counsel that he had been a model\n\n prisoner, he has family in his home country, he was very isolated at the time of his\n\n 2017 conviction, his relationship with his twelve-year-old niece was not sexual in\n\n nature, and he pleaded guilty to molesting her because he was frightened of getting a\n\n more severe sentence. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then addressed the court directly. He\n\n apologized for entering the country illegally, explained that he had gotten married\n\n and had a child since he was deported in 2020, and stated that he returned to the\n\n United States in search of employment to provide for his family. He requested the\n\n opportunity to be reunited with his wife and child. At the district court\u2019s request,\n\n                                             4\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024     Page: 5\n\n\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro then explained the events leading up to his 2017 conviction,\n\n reiterating that he never had a sexual relationship with his niece.\n\n       The district court then described the facts it was considering in determining an\n\n appropriate sentence for Mr. Vasquez-Castro. The court noted that it was\n\n \u201cconsidering all [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] arguments,\u201d including that he \u201cwas coming\n\n to [the] United States to work, that economic circumstances in his home country are\n\n very difficult, and he has a family to support; [his] argument made in his motion that\n\n his travel to the United States was very difficult, including having to pay human\n\n smugglers; [and] that [he] speaks Spanish[.]\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. VI at 16\u201317. The court\n\n did not find \u201cany [of] these factors merit a lower sentencing, given [Mr. Vasquez-\n\n Castro\u2019s] behavior while in the United States committing now his second felony in\n\n the United States.\u201d Id. at 17.\n\n       The district court also \u201cconsider[ed] that [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] denies sexually\n\n assaulting the 12-year-old victim in his prior State case, even though [he] admitted to\n\n at least some of the . . . allegations against him.\u201d Id. The court considered\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument \u201cthat he was young when he committed these State\n\n crimes and he was culturally isolated,\u201d although the court \u201cnote[d] that\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] came to live in the United States with his older brother and\n\n was a member of a church which apparently had other Guatemalans in it, so he was\n\n not completely isolated; he had family and church surrounding him.\u201d Id. The district\n\n court also \u201cconsider[ed] [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] argument that he has worked at the\n\n detention center and that he\u2019s a model prisoner and that the State will extradite\n\n                                             5\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024    Page: 6\n\n\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] for his State crime,\u201d as well as \u201c[his] argument that he has\n\n family in his home country that supports him\u201d and \u201cfamily here in the U.S. that\n\n supports him as well.\u201d Id.\n\n       The court noted it was considering \u201cthe argument that [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] is\n\n innocent of the crime against the little girl and that he pled because he was frightened\n\n and this was actually just some confusion about a child having a cell phone\u201d and\n\n \u201cthat the victim in that case may have asked for less time, which is why\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] only got a 48-month sentence in his State case.\u201d Id. at 17\u201318.\n\n The court also considered that the Government was asking for a higher-end sentence.\n\n       The district court considered Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s history and the nature and\n\n circumstances of the offense, noting that his history \u201cincludes a 2017 conviction for\n\n attempted rape where [he] molested his 12-year-old step-niece.\u201d Id. at 18. The court\n\n considered \u201cthat this offense is of [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] returning to the country in\n\n which he committed this serious crime while still on probation for that crime,\n\n returning only two years after his release for the State sentence.\u201d Id.\n\n       The district court also considered \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to\n\n provide just punishment, respect for the law, adequate deterrence, and protection of\n\n the public.\u201d1 Id. It found \u201can increased sentence is just punishment,\u201d as \u201c[i]t helps\n\n protect the public from [Mr. Vasquez-Castro], [and] provides adequate deterrence to\n\n\n       1\n          Given Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s immigrant status, the district court announced\n that it would not consider treatment because Mr. Vasquez-Castro would be returned\n to Guatemala upon completion of his sentence. Neither party requested that the\n district court consider treatment.\n                                             6\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024     Page: 7\n\n\n\n him for committing further crimes.\u201d Id. at 18\u201319. The court \u201cconsidered that\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] received a lenient sentence for his prior sex case and then\n\n violated his probation by coming back to the United States quickly upon release.\u201d Id.\n\n at 19. The court explained that it was \u201cnot re-punishing him for his State crime or\n\n trying to make up for a lenient sentence in his State court [case],\u201d and instead was\n\n \u201cjust noting that the lenient sentence in his prior case did not prevent him from\n\n coming to the United States so quickly upon release; thereby committing another\n\n felony\u201d and \u201cconsidering the need to protect the public\u201d because Mr. Vasquez-Castro\n\n \u201cha[d] shown his ability to molest children.\u201d Id. Thus, district court concluded that\n\n \u201cjust punishment requires the Court to give a higher-than-Guideline[s] sentence\n\n because [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] reentered the country illegally after having committed\n\n a very serious crime while in the country\u201d and \u201che was released from prison on that\n\n crime only about two years before he committed this crime.\u201d Id.\n\n        The court also \u201cconsider[ed] the kinds of sentences available, sentencing\n\n range, and the Guideline[s] policies\u201d and \u201cthe need[] to avoid unwarranted\n\n sentencing disparities.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320. It explained that Mr. Vasquez-Castro \u201creceived\n\n a somewhat lower sentence for his prior sex offense, a lower sentence than . . . most\n\n defendants are given,\u201d thus finding that \u201cthis sentence, in part, will avoid\n\n unwarranted sentencing disparities because many defendants would have received a\n\n higher sentence.\u201d Id. at 20. All the same, \u201cif there is any sentencing disparity,\u201d the\n\n court found that such a disparity \u201cis, in fact, warranted by the facts in this case.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024       Page: 8\n\n\n\n       The court then sentenced Mr. Vasquez-Castro to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n This represented an upward variance from the Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months.\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro timely appealed, challenging the substantive reasonableness of\n\n the sentence imposed.\n\n                                II.      DISCUSSION\n\n                                A.     Standard of Review\n\n        \u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the\n\n Guidelines range, [we] must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion\n\n standard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). The substantive\n\n reasonableness of a sentence centers on \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is\n\n reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in\n\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d United States v. Conlan, 500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n The factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\n\n defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the\n\n seriousness of the crime, deter future criminal conduct, protect the public from the\n\n defendant\u2019s further crimes, and provide training, medical care, or rehabilitation;\n\n (3) the sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines; (5) the Sentencing\n\n Commission\u2019s policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n disparities; and (7) the need for restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); see also United\n\n States v. Barnes, 890 F.3d 910, 915 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\n       \u201cWe give substantial deference to the district court\u2019s weighing of these\n\n factors.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 915. Thus, \u201c[w]e do not reweigh the sentencing factors\n\n                                             8\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024      Page: 9\n\n\n\n but instead ask whether the sentence fell within the range of rationally available\n\n choices that [the] facts and the law at issue can fairly support.\u201d United States v. Blair,\n\n 933 F.3d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). We \u201cwill\n\n only overturn a sentence that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly\n\n unreasonable,\u201d United States v. Williams, 994 F.3d 1176, 1180 (10th Cir. 2021)\n\n (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       \u201cIf [the district court] decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is\n\n warranted, [it] must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\n\n justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d Gall,\n\n 552 U.S. at 50. \u201c[A] major departure should be supported by a more significant\n\n justification than a minor one.\u201d Id.; see also United States v. Lente, 759 F.3d 1149,\n\n 1158 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201cA \u2018major\u2019 variance should have \u2018a more significant\n\n justification than a minor one.\u2019\u201d (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 50)). All the same, while\n\n we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation,\u201d we \u201cmay not apply a presumption of\n\n unreasonableness.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. To the contrary, \u201cwe uphold even\n\n substantial variances when the district court properly weighs the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\n\n and offers valid reasons for the chosen sentence.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 916. \u201cStill, we\n\n do not just provide a rubber stamp of approval and therefore must determine if the\n\n district court\u2019s proffered rationale, on aggregate, justifies the magnitude of the\n\n sentence.\u201d United States v. Walker, 74 F.4th 1163, 1202 (10th Cir. 2023) (internal\n\n quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024    Page: 10\n\n\n\n                                       B.   Application\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro asserts that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.\n\n  He argues the district court abused its discretion when it varied upward from the\n\n  Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months and sentenced him to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n  Specifically, Mr. Vasquez-Castro claims \u201c[t]here was insufficient cause to issue an\n\n  upward variance and the sentence was otherwise substantively unreasonable,\u201d\n\n  arguing the district court did not properly weigh the mitigating factors Mr. Vasquez-\n\n  Castro identified. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He also asserts the district court \u201cmyopically\n\n  focused\u201d on his 2017 conviction. Id.\n\n        Failure to Consider Mitigating Factors\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro first asserts the district court did not consider the\n\n  mitigating factors in this case. He notes there was nothing aggravating about the\n\n  conduct in the instant offense. Additionally, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues the district\n\n  court did not properly consider his personal history and the circumstances of this\n\n  case, including that he has been a model prisoner and has family to support in\n\n  Guatemala. Mr. Vasquez-Castro also notes that he was here for economic reasons, he\n\n  did not commit any new crimes while in the United States, this is his first\n\n  immigration offense, he has no criminal history beyond the 2017 conviction, and\n\n  there is a low risk of recidivism.\n\n        When imposing sentences, district courts \u201cshould engage in a holistic inquiry\n\n  of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d Lente, 759 F.3d at 1174 (quotation marks omitted), and\n\n  \u201cconsider every convicted person as an individual,\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 52 (quoting\n\n                                             10\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024    Page: 11\n\n\n\n  Koon v United States, 518 U.S. 81, 113 (1996)). But while the court should not focus\n\n  solely on one factor, United States v. Walker, 844 F.3d 1253, 1259 (10th Cir. 2017),\n\n  it \u201cneed not afford equal weight to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d United States v. Cookson,\n\n  922 F.3d 1079, 1094 (10th Cir. 2019). \u201c[W]e must . . . defer not only to a district\n\n  court\u2019s factual findings but also to its determinations of the weight to be afforded to\n\n  such findings.\u201d United States v. Smart, 518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir. 2008). Where a\n\n  district court decides to vary, it \u201cproperly engages in [the \u00a7 3553(a)] inquiry when it\n\n  bases its decision on specific, articulable facts supporting the variance and does not\n\n  employ an impermissible methodology or rely on facts that would make the decision\n\n  out of bounds.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 916.\n\n        In this case, the district court expressly discussed and considered the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\n  factors, including the allegedly mitigating factors identified by Mr. Vasquez-Castro.\n\n  For example, the court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and\n\n  Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s history and characteristics, noting that \u201c[Mr. Vasquez-Castro]\n\n  was coming to [the] United States to work, that economic circumstances in his home\n\n  country are very difficult, and he has a family to support,\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. IV at 16,\n\n  and \u201cthat [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] has worked at the detention center and that he\u2019s a\n\n  model prisoner,\u201d id. at 17. Despite considering these facts, the district court\n\n  determined that \u201can increased sentence is just punishment,\u201d noting that it would help\n\n  protect the public and provide adequate deterrence. Id. at 18. The district court also\n\n  considered the kinds of sentences available, the Guidelines range, and the Guidelines\n\n  policy statements, concluding that the presumptive reasonableness of the Guidelines\n\n                                             11\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024     Page: 12\n\n\n\n  range of 18 to 24 months was overcome by the facts of the case, particularly\n\n  Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s prior conviction and his reentry into the country shortly after\n\n  his release. Finally, the court found that an increased sentence would avoid any\n\n  unwarranted sentencing disparity because Mr. Vasquez-Castro received a lower\n\n  sentence for his 2017 conviction than most defendants are given.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro disagrees with how the district court weighed each these\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But the record reflects that the district court considered each of the\n\n  factors, and we must defer to the weight the court afforded to them. United States v.\n\n  Gross, 44 F.4th 1298, 1305 (10th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e will not examine the weight a\n\n  district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the\n\n  balance between them anew.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because the\n\n  district court properly explained its decision to vary upward and based that decision\n\n  on appropriate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the resulting sentence was\n\n  substantively reasonable.\n\n        Focus on the 2017 Conviction\n\n        In addition, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues the district court \u201cmyopically focused\n\n  on [his] prior State sex offense and re-punished him for . . . what it perceived to be\n\n  too low of a sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He argues the Guidelines already took\n\n  his prior conviction fully into consideration when the court calculated his criminal\n\n  history category. Thus, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues that the district court\u2019s upward\n\n  variance essentially double-counted his 2017 conviction.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353          Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024      Page: 13\n\n\n\n         Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the court improperly focused on his prior\n\n  conviction is without merit. As has been addressed, the district court considered the\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors at length. There is \u201c[n]o limitation\u201d placed on the information that a\n\n  district court may consider \u201cconcerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d of a\n\n  defendant at sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. Further, we must defer to the district\n\n  court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s discussion of his 2017\n\n  conviction does not alone render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively\n\n  unreasonable.\n\n         In addition, contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s assertion, the district court did\n\n  not repunish him for his 2017 conviction. The court expressly stated that it was\n\n  \u201csentencing [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] only for this crime,\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. IV at 20,\n\n  and that it was \u201cnot re-punishing him for his State crime or trying to make up for a\n\n  lenient sentence in his State court [case],\u201d id. at 19. Instead, the district court\n\n  explained that it was \u201cconsidering [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] past behavior in imposing\n\n  a sentence that will deter [him], protect the public, and satisfy the other 3553(a)\n\n  factors.\u201d Id. at 20. And the court noted \u201cthat the lenient sentence in his prior case did\n\n  not prevent him from coming to the United States so quickly upon release; thereby\n\n  committing another felony.\u201d Id. at 19.\n\n         Finally, Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n  already counted his 2017 conviction, and that the district court\u2019s further\n\n  consideration of that conviction resulting in a \u201cdouble counting,\u201d is unavailing. The\n\n  Sentencing Guidelines themselves reflect that a defendant\u2019s criminal history may\n\n                                              13\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024     Page: 14\n\n\n\n  justify a sentence above the Guidelines range. For example, the Guidelines explicitly\n\n  consider the possibility of upward variances when \u201creliable information indicates that\n\n  the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the\n\n  seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant\n\n  will commit other crimes.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\n\n  Manual, \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) (Nov. 2021). Similarly, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2), when a\n\n  defendant engaged in criminal conduct resulting in a felony conviction prior to his\n\n  first order of deportation or removal, his offense level for illegal reentry will increase\n\n  by an amount calculated based on the length of the sentence imposed for the prior\n\n  felony conviction. The comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 explain \u201c[t]here may be cases\n\n  in which the offense level provided by an enhancement in subsection (b)(2)\n\n  . . . substantially understates or overstates the seriousness of the conduct underlying\n\n  the prior offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). When \u201cthe length of the sentence\n\n  imposed does not reflect the seriousness of the prior offense[,] . . . a departure may\n\n  be warranted.\u201d Id. Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of the 2017 conviction does\n\n  not render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable.\n\n                               III.       CONCLUSION\n\n        Contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s arguments, the district court\u2019s weighing of\n\n  the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, consideration of his prior offense conduct, and resulting\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024   Page: 15\n\n\n\n  sentencing decision was substantively reasonable.

Siler, United States Circuit Judge for the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\ffor his sole profit. While Duncan primarily sold his prostitutes\u2014including the\n\nvictim\u2014in person on the Oakland \u201cblade,\u201d he also set up online advertisements on\n\nadult websites. Two of these advertisements of the victim included multiple pictures\n\nof the victim in her underwear, a description of her, the prices Duncan would charge,\n\nand his own phone numbers. At trial, the government successfully introduced PDF\n\ncopies of these advertisements as evidence. On appeal, Duncan argues that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s decision to admit this evidence violated the Rules of Evidence because the\n\ngovernment failed to properly authenticate the advertisements and that his\n\nconviction should therefore be vacated. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment.\n\n      The district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence is reviewed for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Tank, 200 F.3d 627, 630 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWe review a\n\ndistrict court\u2019s finding that evidence is supported by a proper foundation for an abuse\n\nof discretion.\u201d). If we find admission of the evidence to be a mistake, we then\n\nproceed to determine if it was a harmless error. See United States v. Mehrmanesh,\n\n689 F.2d 822, 832 (9th Cir. 1982) (examining a mistaken evidentiary ruling for\n\nharmless error). Reversal is warranted only if any \u201cerror more likely than not\n\naffected the verdict.\u201d United States v. Workinger, 90 F.3d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n      To show that evidence is admissible, the proponent must put forward\n\n\u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims\n\n\n                                          2                                     22-10278\n\fit is.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). Bearing this burden is simply a matter of making \u201ca\n\nprima facie showing of authenticity\u201d sufficient for a reasonable jury to \u201cfind in favor\n\nof authenticity or identification.\u201d Tank, 200 F.3d at 630 (quoting United States v.\n\nBlack, 767 F.2d 1334, 1342 (9th Cir. 1985)). Once the prima facie case is made,\n\n\u201c[t]he government must also establish a connection between the proffered evidence\n\nand the defendant.\u201d Id.\n\n       Here, the government put forth the testimony of FBI Special Agent Schofield.\n\nOn October 11, 2018, Agent Schofield discovered two online prostitution\n\nadvertisements that included pictures of the victim alongside Duncan\u2019s phone\n\nnumber. Using his government computer, he utilized the \u201cprint to PDF\u201d feature to\n\nconvert the webpages \u201cto a file that could be saved on the computer.\u201d Agent\n\nSchofield testified that the exhibits the government sought to introduce were \u201cfair\n\nand accurate depictions\u201d of what he saw online, and testified to the website where\n\nhe obtained them. He also testified that he had utilized this feature \u201cprobably\n\nhundreds\u201d of times and had never known it to change the content of the webpage.\n\nThe only information added to the file was a small date stamp and a URL indicating\n\nthe origin of the file. The government then connected the exhibits to Duncan by\n\nreferring to the listed phone numbers, which had already been shown to belong to\n\nhim.\n\n       Duncan objected that the exhibits lacked foundation. Specifically, he argued\n\n\n                                          3                                     22-10278\n\fthat the government failed to prove that Duncan himself had authored the\n\nadvertisements. The court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence,\n\nreasoning that while the government could not definitively say at the time of\n\nadmittance that Duncan authored or created the advertisements, the government had\n\nmade a prima facie case of their authenticity\u2014that is, the online prostitution\n\nadvertisements were what the government purported them to be\u2014and that there was\n\nsufficient connection between the advertisements and Duncan.\n\n      Because we agree with the district court that the government sustained its\n\nburden to make a prima facie showing of authenticity and to connect the exhibits to\n\nDuncan, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them.\n\nThe purpose of Agent Schofield\u2019s testimony was to prove that the exhibits were in\n\nfact true and accurate representations of what he saw on the internet that day. His\n\ntestimony was not presented to prove that Duncan actually authored the posts. Once\n\nthe government proved that the exhibits were accurate copies of the prostitution\n\nadvertisements that Agent Schofield observed online, it was able to connect those\n\nexhibits to Duncan through the phone numbers in the advertisements.\n\n      Duncan\u2019s reliance on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v.\n\nJackson, 208 F.3d 633 (7th Cir. 2000), is unavailing. In Jackson, the Seventh Circuit\n\naffirmed a lower court\u2019s decision to exclude screenshots from a white supremacist\n\nchat room because they could not be authenticated under Rule 801. Id. at 637-38.\n\n\n                                          4                                     22-10278\n\fHowever, the facts of the authentication dispute in Jackson are readily\n\ndistinguishable. In that case, there was significant evidence in the record of the\n\nproponent\u2019s untrustworthiness, leading the trial court to conclude that the proponent\n\nfailed to meet her prima facie burden that the screenshots were what she claimed\n\nthem to be, \u201cas opposed to being slipped onto the groups\u2019 websites by [the\n\nproponent] herself, who was a skilled computer user.\u201d Id. at 638. In this case,\n\nhowever, Duncan never argued to the district court that Agent Schofield was\n\nuntrustworthy in his testimony authenticating the exhibits.        Furthermore, the\n\ngovernment provided further evidence\u2014apart from Agent Schofield\u2019s testimony\u2014\n\nto make a prima facie showing that the online prostitution advertisements were what\n\nthe government claimed them to be.\n\n      Evaluated under the Rule 901 standard as expounded in Tank, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment made an adequate foundational showing of the relevance and the\n\nauthenticity\u201d of the online prostitution advertisements. Tank, 200 F.3d at 631. The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them, and once properly\n\nadmitted, it was up to \u201cthe jury to decide what weight to give that evidence.\u201d Id.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5                                    22-10278\n\f","                                                                NOT PRECEDENTIAL\n\n                       UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                            FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                 ___________\n\n                                       No. 23-2443\n                                       __________\n\n                                    JAMES MOSLEY,\n                                              Appellant\n\n                                             v.\n\n                   CITY OF PHILADELPHIA; DANIEL J.

For following reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n*\n This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.\n\f       Mosley filed suit against the Honorable Daniel J. Anders of the Philadelphia Court\n\nof Common Pleas and the City of Philadelphia, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Dkt. No.\n\n2. Mosley alleged that Judge Anders violated his due process rights and acted\n\nnegligently and discriminatorily when he issued an order stating that Mosley could not\n\nrepresent an estate pro se. Id. at 3 & 7. Mosley sought compensatory damages and\n\ninjunctive relief. Id. at 4. The District Court screened the action under 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1915(e) and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Dkt. No. 4. Mosley timely filed a\n\nnotice of appeal. Dkt. No. 6.\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the sua sponte\n\ndismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) is plenary. 1 Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d 366,\n\n373 (3d Cir. 2020).\n\n       To the extent Mosley argues on appeal that the District Court erred in dismissing\n\nhis claims against Judge Anders, we disagree. Mosley\u2019s claims for money damages\n\nbased on Judge Anders\u2019 order are barred by judicial immunity. See Figueroa v.\n\nBlackburn, 208 F.3d 435, 440-42 (3d Cir. 2000). To the extent Mosley challenges the\n\nconstitutionality of the rule prohibiting a pro se litigant from representing an estate, Judge\n\nAnders is not the proper defendant because he did not promulgate the rule; rather, he\n\n\n1\n  We do not review issues Mosley has not argued on appeal, such as the District Court\u2019s\ndismissal of his claims against the City of Philadelphia. See Barna v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of\nPanther Valley Sch. Dist., 877 F.3d 136, 145-47 (3d Cir. 2017) (explaining that an\nappellant\u2019s failure to raise an argument constitutes forfeiture of that argument). We\nrecognize that Mosley\u2019s brief is sparse, but we construe his pro se filings liberally and\nwill review his arguments. See Erickson v.

For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.\n\n      In 2021, Blount filed a complaint against Leslie and Kim Smith, a registered\n\nnurse, claiming a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights based on deliberate\n\nindifference to his serious medical needs. Blount\u2019s complaint, which he later amended,\n\nstemmed from a decision to discontinue his asthma inhalers and other asthma treatment.\n\nHe averred that, because he did not have his medication, he suffered an asthma attack\n\nwhen correctional officers used oleoresin capsicum spray (pepper spray) in another cell.\n\n      The District Court granted Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss Blount\u2019s amended complaint\n\nbecause Smith, who had denied Blount\u2019s grievance, lacked personal involvement in the\n\nalleged unlawful conduct.1 Following discovery, the District Court granted Leslie\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The District Court ruled that Leslie\u2019s decision to\n\ndiscontinue Blount\u2019s medication was based on his professional judgment and did not\n\nviolate the Constitution. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n A Magistrate Judge adjudicated the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) upon the\nconsent of the parties.\n\n                                            2\n\f         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318,\n\n322 (3d Cir. 2009). The same standard applies to the extent Blount appeals the grant of\n\nSmith\u2019s motion to dismiss. Drummond v. Robinson Twp., 9 F.4th 217, 225 n.4 (3d Cir.\n\n2021).\n\n         As set forth in further detail in the District Court\u2019s decision, Blount\u2019s medical\n\nrecords reflect that he was prescribed asthma medications, including inhalers and a\n\nbronchodilator, while housed at SCI-Benner Township. In April 2019, Blount met with a\n\nphysician\u2019s assistant in the asthma chronic care clinic. The provider noted that Blount\u2019s\n\nasthma control was good and that he used less than one inhaler canister per month.\n\nBlount\u2019s medications were renewed. In June 2019, Blount refused to eat for over a week.\n\nHe refused offers of breathing treatments during this period. Blount met with a nurse and\n\na physician\u2019s assistant in July 2019 with complaints of shortness of breath and\/or chest\n\npain. The physician\u2019s assistant noted that Blount had asthma and reported that a change\n\nin therapy was not needed.\n\n         On October 9, 2019, Blount was transferred to SCI-Forest. His transfer records\n\nnoted that he had moderate persistent asthma. It appears that Leslie discontinued\n\nBlount\u2019s asthma medications and removed him from the asthma chronic clinic when he\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\farrived.2 On October 17, 2019, Blount saw Leslie at sick call and told him that he needed\n\nhis inhalers. Leslie\u2019s notes state that Blount did not need inhalers and that Blount should\n\nreturn to sick call as needed. He told Blount that the inhalers had been discontinued\n\nbecause Blount had not picked them up since June. See DCT ECF No. 54-2 at 158; DCT\n\nECF No. 60 at 2.\n\n       Blount told Leslie that his medications were brought to his cell because he was in\n\nthe restricted housing unit, and that his breathing treatments and emergency inhaler were\n\nonly used as needed. He states that Leslie determined that the medications were not\n\nneeded without examining him, and that later that day, he had an asthma attack. Blount\n\nwas exposed to pepper spray and, as a result, suffered labored breathing, chest\n\nconstriction, coughing, and dizziness. Blount states that an inhaler would have relieved\n\nthese ailments. See DCT ECF No. 60 at 2-3.3\n\n       On November 5, 2019, Blount saw a nurse and a certified nurse practitioner for\n\ncomplaints of shortness of breath. He wanted his inhalers reinstated. The nurse\n\npractitioner assessed Blount and concluded that he did not need them. Blount saw Leslie\n\nagain on December 4, 2019. Leslie reported that Blount was yelling that he was having\n\n\n2\n  Smith\u2019s response to Blount\u2019s grievance states that Leslie discontinued the medications\nand removed him from the clinic. Blount\u2019s medical records reflect that his medications\nwere discontinued on October 9, 2019. See DCT ECF No. 54-2 at 482-513.\n3\n  Blount also states that he pushed the emergency call button in his cell and cried out for\nhelp, but he did not receive medical attention. Id.\n\n                                             4\n\fasthma attacks and needed his inhalers. Leslie told Blount that he did not need them.\n\nLeslie\u2019s progress notes state that there was no indication for inhalers, that Blount had not\n\nused an inhaler since June, and that Blount had not been seen urgently for breathing\n\ndifficulties. Blount\u2019s medical records do not reflect that he sought treatment for asthma\n\nagain at SCI-Forest. In November 2020, he was transferred to SCI-Mahanoy, where he\n\nwas prescribed asthma medication.\n\n       To establish a violation of the Eighth Amendment, Blount was required to show\n\nthat Leslie was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. Pearson v. Prison\n\nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 534 (3d Cir. 2017). The deliberate indifference standard is\n\nmet where a provider has recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm. Giles,\n\n571 F.3d at 330. Deliberate indifference can be shown by knowledge of the need for care\n\nand an intentional refusal to provide it. Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir.\n\n1993). Negligence is insufficient. Id.\n\n       The District Court found that medical staff at SCI-Forest, including Leslie, had\n\nexamined Blount for asthma-related complaints and that, based on these examinations,\n\nLeslie determined that Blount\u2019s asthma medications were no longer needed. Blount\n\nasserts on appeal that Leslie discontinued his asthma medication based only upon a\n\nreview of his chart, and as a result, he lacked access to medication he needed when he\n\nhad an asthma attack on October 17, 2023.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       The record reflects that a nurse took Blount\u2019s vital signs when he arrived at SCI-\n\nForest on October 9, 2019, and that medical staff monitored him on October 9 and 10\n\nwhile he was confined in a dry cell.4 Medical staff did not examine Blount for asthma-\n\nrelated complaints until after he had the asthma attack on October 17. Leslie saw Blount\n\nearlier that day, and his records do not show that he examined Blount or that Blount had\n\nasthma symptoms. While Blount told Leslie that he needed his inhalers, the record does\n\nnot support the conclusion that Leslie was aware of a need for treatment and intentionally\n\nrefused it. Leslie apparently believed that Blount no longer needed medication because\n\nhe had not been using it. Blount disagrees that Leslie had reason to discontinue his\n\nmedication and contends that Leslie should have known that he could be in danger\n\nwithout an inhaler. However, even if Leslie erred in assessing Blount\u2019s records or\n\ncondition, there was no constitutional violation.5\n\n\n\n\n4\n Blount was confined in a cell without running water because it was believed he might\nhave ingested drugs.\n5\n To the extent Blount appeals the dismissal of his claims against Smith, the District\nCourt did not err in ruling that he did not state a claim for relief based on Smith\u2019s denial\nof his grievance. See Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (holding\ndefendants who denied prisoner\u2019s grievance lacked requisite personal involvement in\nalleged misconduct).\n\n\n                                              6\n\f        Accordingly, because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will\n\nsummarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.

Because Pharmacia has failed to adduce evidence that satisfies a condition\n\nprecedent necessary for Twin City\u2019s insurance policy to attach, we will affirm.\n\n                                              I\n\n       Pharmacia, a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, purchased a $200 million\n\ndirectors and officers insurance tower1 from thirteen companies through an insurance\n\nbroker. The first layer of the tower consisted of a $25 million primary policy issued by\n\nNational Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa (the \u201cPrimary Policy\u201d). The\n\nnext twelve policies provided excess insurance totaling $175 million.2 Twin City sold\n\n\n       1\n         An insurance tower is a plan in which \u201ca primary insurer respond[s] first to any\ncovered loss, and excess insurers respond[] in a predetermined order if the loss exceeds\nthe coverage provided by the primary policy.\u201d John F.

Clause X, entitled \u201cChoice of Law,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]his\npolicy shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of\nNew York (with exception of the procedural law required by Clause IX [which requires\ndisputes arising under or relating to the policy be resolved under Bermuda\u2019s arbitration\nact], which shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Bermuda.)\u201d\nApp. 1022-23.

Pharmacia Corp., et al., No. 03-cv-01519 (AET) (TJB)\n\nCompl. ECF No. 1, (D.N.J.). After ten years of litigation, the case settled,4 and\n\nPharmacia incurred approximately $207 million in defense and indemnity costs.\n\nPharmacia then provided Twin City proof that the excess carriers ahead of it in the\n\ninsurance tower paid their policy limits5 and asked Twin City to provide coverage. Twin\n\nCity declined.\n\n       Pharmacia sued Twin City, seeking, among other things, a declaration that the\n\nPolicy obligates Twin City to indemnify Pharmacia for the losses incurred in the\n\nshareholder action. The District Court granted Twin City\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment, denied Pharmacia\u2019s cross-motion, and dismissed the case with prejudice. The\n\nCourt found that: (1) the plain language of the Policy required the other excess insurers to\n\nadmit liability as a condition precedent for coverage to attach; (2) six of them had\n\n\n\n       3\n          Pfizer, Inc. subsequently acquired Pharmacia.\n       4\n          By the time of the settlement, the Primary Policy was exhausted, and the first-\nlayer excess insurer had taken over defense costs.\n        5\n           Five of these carriers also expressly disclaimed any admission of wrongdoing or\nliability in their respective indemnification agreements with Pharmacia.\n                                                3\n\fdisclaimed liability, and (3) as a result, a condition for coverage was not satisfied.\n\nPharmacia appeals.\n\n                                              II6\n\n       .

Specifically, Pharmacia must show both that\n\nthe insurers ahead of Twin City in the tower have (1) \u201cduly admitted liability and [(2)] . .\n\n. paid the full amount of their respective liability.\u201d App. 601. The use of the word \u201cand\u201d\n\ndemonstrates that both conditions must be met. See Pine Belt Chevrolet, Inc. v. Jersey\n\nCent.

Regardless of whether the other insurers in the tower paid their\n\npolicy limits, the record does not demonstrate that all of those insurers admitted\n\nliability.9, 10 Because Pharmacia has failed to establish at least one condition precedent,\n\nthe District Court correctly declined to declare that Twin City owes Pharmacia\n\ncoverage.11\n\n\n       8\n          Cf. John M. O\u2019Quinn, P.C. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 906 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir.\n2018) (construing a similar exhaustion provision crafted with the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d to\npermit coverage to attach upon either admission of liability or issuance of payment, i.e.,\n\u201c[coverage] shall not attach unless and until the [u]nderwriters of the [u]nderlying\n[p]olicy\/ies shall have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay\u201d).\n        9\n          Moreover, Pharmacia has identified no case that applies \u201cfunctional exhaustion\u201d\nto a situation like the one here, where the insured is required to show both that the other\nexcess carriers admitted liability and that they paid the policy limit.\n        10\n           Pharmacia contends that the District Court improperly considered the other\ninsurers\u2019 settlement agreements for the proposition that they disclaimed liability in\nviolation of FED. R. EVID. 408. See Appellant Br. at 46-49. We need not, however, rely\non the settlement agreements because, even without consideration of those agreements,\nPharmacia has failed to show that all the insurers ahead of Twin City in the insurance\ntower admitted liability, as required by the Policy\u2019s exhaustion provision. Pharmacia\u2019s\nassertion that an insurer\u2019s payment of a policy limit alone constitutes an admission of\nliability is speculative as other reasons may cause a carrier to pay its policy limit, such as\navoiding litigation. In addition, to infer that payment of the full policy is a concession of\nliability would render the admission-of-liability condition superfluous. In any event, the\nDistrict Court did not err by considering the settlement agreements, as Rule 408 \"allows\nevidence of . . . agreements of compromise to prove a consequential, material fact in\nissue other than validity of the claim or its amount,\" such as disclaimers of liability. 2\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence \u00a7 408.08 (2015).\n        11\n           This conclusion is consistent with JP Morgan Chase & Co. v. Indian Harbor Ins.\nCo., 98 A.D.3d 18 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012). There, a court applying Illinois law\ninterpreted an identical exhaustion provision contained in a Twin City policy to\nunambiguously impose two conditions precedent for Twin City\u2019s coverage to attach: (1)\n                                              7\n\f                                             III\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\nadmitting liability and (2) paying the full amount of their liability. Id. at 21.

Such is the case here. Multi-\nbillion-dollar company FTX Trading Ltd. (\u201cFTX\u201d) filed for\nbankruptcy after a sudden and unprecedented collapse that sent\nshockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. The issue\nbefore us is whether 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c)(2) mandates the\nBankruptcy Court to grant the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner to investigate FTX\u2019s management. We hold that\nit does, given both the statute\u2019s plain text and Congress\u2019s\nexpressed intent in enacting this portion of the Bankruptcy\nCode. Accordingly, we will reverse the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndenial of the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion, and remand for the\nappointment of an examiner consistent with this opinion.\n\n       I.     Factual and Procedural History\n\n       Over the course of eight days in November 2022, the\ncryptocurrency company FTX suffered a catastrophic decline\nin value. The primary owner of FTX, Samuel Bankman-Fried,\nalso owned most of Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency\nhedge fund. In early November, industry reports claimed that\nAlameda Research was financially compromised, and\nquestions regarding a conflict of interest between the two\nallegedly independent companies began to arise. What\nfollowed were discoveries of multiple corporate failures,\nincluding FTX\u2019s use of software to conceal the funneling of\nFTX customer funds into Alameda Research to bolster its\nbalance sheet. These discoveries caused FTX, a company that\nhad been valued at $32 billion earlier in 2022, to face a sudden\nand severe liquidity crisis as customers withdrew billions of\ndollars over the course of a few days. Since the collapse,\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fcriminal investigations into FTX have unearthed evidence of\nwidespread fraud and the embezzlement of customers\u2019 funds.1\n\n        Immediately following the crash, on November 11,\n2022, Mr. Bankman-Fried appointed John J. Ray, III to replace\nhim as CEO of FTX and its numerous affiliates (\u201cFTX\nGroup\u201d). Over the next three days, Mr. Ray filed multiple\nvoluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United\nStates Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. Mr. Ray, an\nexperienced bankruptcy practitioner who claims to have\nsupervised the restructuring of \u201cseveral of the largest corporate\nfailures in history,\u201d stated in his first report as debtor in\npossession that he had never before \u201cseen such a complete\nfailure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of\ntrustworthy financial information.\u201d JA 52. He deemed the\nsituation at FTX Group \u201cunprecedented,\u201d citing, inter alia, the\ncompromised integrity of the companies\u2019 operating systems,\nthe \u201cfaulty regulatory oversight\u201d of FTX\u2019s operations abroad,\nand the \u201cconcentration of control in the hands of a very small\ngroup of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially\ncompromised individuals.\u201d JA 52.\n\n        Mr. Ray further reported that many of the companies in\nFTX Group lacked \u201cappropriate corporate governance,\u201d\noperating without a functioning board of directors and failing\nto produce audited financial statements. JA 59. He maintained\nthat FTX Group \u201cdid not maintain centralized control of its\ncash\u201d and kept no accurate list of its bank accounts or the\naccounts\u2019 signatories. JA 60. FTX Group companies were\nhistorically unable to produce accurate financial statements or\na \u201creliable cash forecast.\u201d JA 60\u201362. As a result of these \u201ccash\nmanagement failures,\u201d Mr. Ray was unable to determine how\nmuch cash the companies had when the bankruptcy petitions\nwere filed. JA 61. He also found that FTX Group had \u201cbillions\nin investments\u201d in non-cryptocurrency assets, but these\ninvestments could not be completely accounted for due to the\n\n\n1\n   On November 2, 2023, Samuel Bankman-Fried was\nconvicted of seven wire fraud, conspiracy, and money\nlaundering charges. His sentencing is scheduled for March\n2024. Other former FTX executives pled guilty to similar\ncharges.\n\n                               4\n\fcompanies\u2019 failure to \u201ckeep complete books and records.\u201d JA\n66.\n\n       In addition, Mr. Ray described how FTX Group failed\nto implement a corporate system to regulate cash\ndisbursements. Employees would simply submit \u201cpayment\nrequests through an on-line \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate\ngroup of supervisors approved disbursements by responding\nwith personalized emojis.\u201d2 JA 64. Mr. Ray discovered that\ncorporate funds were used to purchase homes and other\npersonal items for employees in the Bahamas, where FTX was\nheadquartered. For some real estate purchases, there was no\ndocumentation categorizing the transactions as corporate loans\nand the properties were recorded in the Bahamas under the\nnames of the FTX employees or advisors.\n\n       Regarding the companies\u2019 cryptocurrency assets, Mr.\nRay declared FTX Group engaged in \u201c[u]nacceptable\nmanagement practices\u201d including, inter alia, \u201cthe use of an\nunsecured group email account\u201d to access \u201ccritically sensitive\ndata\u201d and \u201cthe use of software to conceal the misuse of\ncustomer funds.\u201d JA 64\u201365. Mr. Ray claimed to identify $372\nmillion of unauthorized cryptocurrency transfers initiated on\nFTX\u2019s petition date, and the subsequent unauthorized\n\u201cminting\u201d of $300 million in FTX\u2019s cryptocurrency tokens,\nFTTs. Id. The disordered state of FTX Group at the time it\nfiled for bankruptcy, exacerbated by the failure of FTX\nfounders to identify sources of supposed additional assets,\nmeant that Mr. Ray and his team of professionals \u201clocated and\nsecured only a fraction of the digital assets.\u201d Id.\n\n       Within weeks of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions,\nthe United States Trustee moved for the appointment of an\nexaminer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). In so doing, the\nU.S. Trustee posited that a public report of the examiner\u2019s\nfindings could reveal the \u201cwider implications\u201d that FTX\u2019s\nunprecedented collapse had for the cryptocurrency industry.\nJA 97. The U.S. Trustee also claimed an examiner could\n\u201callow for a faster and more cost-effective resolution\u201d of the\n\n2\n Mr. Ray revealed that there was no comprehensive list of FTX\nGroup employees and only incomplete human resource records\nof the terms and conditions of employment.\n                              5\n\fbankruptcy proceedings because Mr. Ray could concentrate on\nhis \u201cprimary duty of stabilizing the debtors\u2019 businesses\u201d while\nthe examiner investigated FTX\u2019s compromised pre-petition\nmanagement, which was purportedly responsible for\nmisappropriating $10 billion in customers\u2019 assets. Id.\n\n       Of greater significance for the purposes of this appeal,\nthe U.S. Trustee argued that the Code mandates the Bankruptcy\nCourt to grant their motion and order the appointment of an\nexaminer. Section 1104(c) provides that, in instances like this\nwhere no trustee has been appointed, then:\n\n       [O]n request of a party in interest or the United\n       States trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the\n       court shall order the appointment of an examiner\n       to conduct such an investigation of the debtor as\n       is appropriate, including an investigation of any\n       allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence,\n       misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\n       the management of the affairs of the debtor of or\n       by current or former management of the debtor,\n       if\u2014\n               (1)    such appointment is in the interests\n                      of creditors, any equity security\n                      holders, and other interests of the\n                      estate; or\n               (2)    the debtor\u2019s fixed, liquidated,\n                      unsecured debts, other than debts\n                      for goods, services, or taxes, or\n                      owing to an insider, exceed\n                      $5,000,000.\n\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c) (emphasis added). The U.S. Trustee\nargued that, because they made the request and FTX Group\u2019s\nunsecured debts \u201csubstantially exceed\u201d $5 million,\nappointment of an examiner was mandatory under the plain\nlanguage of subsection (c)(2).3 JA 98.\n\n\n3\n  In addition, the U.S. Trustee advanced the argument that the\nappointment of an examiner would also be proper under\nsubsection 1104(c)(1), claiming that an investigation would be\n\u201cin the best interests of the Debtors\u2019 estates, their creditors, and\n                                 6\n\f        The Committee for Unsecured Creditors (\u201cCreditors\u2019\nCommittee\u201d), the Joint Provisional Liquidators of FTX Digital\nMarkets Ltd., and the Debtors filed their objections to the U.S.\nTrustee\u2019s motion. At a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court,\nthe U.S. Trustee reiterated their position that the appointment\nof an examiner in this instance is mandatory, and argued this\ninterpretation is supported by legislative history that conveys\nCongress\u2019s intent to guarantee an independent investigation\ninto any large-scale bankruptcy. The opposing parties argued\nthe phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section 1104(c) renders the\nappointment of an examiner subject to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndiscretion. JA 299, 307. They claimed such an appointment\nhere would be highly inappropriate, given that an investigation\nwould create an unjustifiable cost for creditors, interfere with\ntheir efforts to stabilize FTX Group, duplicate their findings of\nmanagement wrongdoing, and pose a security risk to\ncryptocurrency codes.\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court agreed with those who opposed\nthe motion and ruled the appointment of an examiner was\ndiscretionary under the Code. JA 17\u201318. The Court\nacknowledged FTX Group\u2019s unsecured debt far exceeded $5\nmillion but found the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section\n1104(c) allowed it to deny the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner, despite the statutory requirements having been\nmet. The Court supported its conclusion by citing Bankruptcy\nCourt decisions and congressional records from the year before\nthe revised Code was enacted.\n\n       II.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The U.S. Trustee appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndecision to the District Court and moved to certify the order for\ndirect appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2).4 The District\n\nequity security holders\u201d given the grounds to suspect \u201cactual\nfraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct in the management of\nthe Debtors.\u201d JA 100 \u00b6 35.\n4\n  The U.S. Trustee first moved for certification in Bankruptcy\nCourt, and then renewed the motion when jurisdiction\ntransferred to the District Court pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n8006(b).\n                               7\n\fCourt granted the certification motion, and this Court\nauthorized the direct appeal. We have jurisdiction over\nChapter 11 cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A). This Court\nreviews questions of law decided by the Bankruptcy Court de\nnovo. In re Trump Ent. Resorts, 810 F.3d 161, 166\u201367 (3d Cir.\n2016).\n\n       III.   Discussion\n\n       The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation:\nwhether the plain text of Section 1104(c)(2) requires a\nbankruptcy court to appoint an examiner, if requested by the\nU.S. Trustee or a party in interest, and if \u201cthe debtor\u2019s total\nfixed, liquidated, unsecured debt\u201d exceeds $5 million. We\nhold that it does. The Bankruptcy Court erred in denying the\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint an examiner to investigate\nFTX Group.\n\n        \u201cOur interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts\n\u2018where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the\nstatute itself.\u2019\u201d Ransom v. FIA Card Servs., N.A., 562 U.S. 61,\n69 (2011) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489\nU.S. 235, 241 (1989)). In interpreting a statute, we are required\n\u201cto give effect to Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d In re Trump, 810 F.3d at\n167. We presume that intent is expressed through the ordinary\nmeaning of the statute\u2019s language. Id. If the meaning of the\ntext is clear, \u201cthe sole function of the courts\u2014at least where the\ndisposition required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce\n[the statute] according to its terms.\u201d Hartford Underwriters\nIns. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore start by\nexamining the plain text of Section 1104(c).\n\n        Congress made plain its intention to mandate the\nappointment of an examiner by using the word \u201cshall,\u201d as in\nthe Bankruptcy Court \u201cshall\u201d appoint an examiner if the terms\nof the statute have been met. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). The\nmeaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d is not ambiguous. It is a \u201cword of\ncommand,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), that\n\u201cnormally creates an obligation impervious to judicial\ndiscretion,\u201d Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &\nLerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998). We have held that \u201cshall\u201d in\na statute is interpreted as \u201cmust,\u201d which means \u201cshall\u201d signals\n\n                                8\n\fwhen a court must follow a statute\u2019s directive regardless of\nwhether it agrees with the result. Scott v. Vantage Corp., 64\nF.4th 462, 477 (3d Cir. 2023). To interpret \u201cshall\u201d as anything\nbut an obligatory command to appoint an examiner, when the\nconditions of subsection 1104(c)(2) have been met, would\nrequire us \u201cto abandon plain meanings altogether.\u201d Litgo N.J.\nInc. v. Comm\u2019r N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot., 725 F.3d 369, 397\nn.17 (3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). Instead, the language\nof subsection 1104(c)(2) requires us to command the\nBankruptcy Court to grant the U.S. Trustee\u2019s request for an\nexaminer in this instance. See Me. Cmty. Health Options v.\nUnited States, 140 S. Ct. 1308, 1320 (2020) (\u201cThe first sign\nthat the statute imposed an obligation is its mandatory\nlanguage: \u2018shall.\u2019\u201d).\n\n        Despite the mandatory language, the Bankruptcy Court\nfound that the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d controls the\nappointment of an examiner under Section 1104(c). Following\nthis interpretation, the text \u201cthe court shall order the\nappointment of an examiner to conduct such an investigation\nof the debtor as is appropriate\u201d means the Bankruptcy Court\nappoints an examiner only if it decides an investigation would\nsuit the circumstances. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). According to this\nreading, context gives \u201cshall\u201d the meaning of \u201cmay.\u201d We\ndisagree.     Under the last-antecedent rule of statutory\nconstruction, \u201cqualifying words, phrases, and clauses are to be\napplied to the words or phrase immediately preceding and not\nto others more remote.\u201d Stepnowski v. Comm\u2019r, 456 F.3d 320,\n324 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Hodge, 321 F.3d\n429, 436 (3d Cir. 2003)). Applying the rule, the phrase \u201cas is\nappropriate\u201d modifies the words that immediately precede it\u2014\nwhich are \u201cto conduct such an examination of the debtor,\u201d not\n\u201cshall order the appointment of an examiner.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1104(c).\n\n        Although instructive, the last-antecedent rule is not\nabsolute and we therefore look to other indicia to discern the\nphrase\u2019s meaning. Viera v. Life. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 642 F.3d\n407, 419 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v.\nPilosi, 393 F.3d 356, 365 (3d Cir. 2004)). We need not look\nfar. As the U.S. Trustee argued below, Section 1104(c) states\n\u201cas is appropriate,\u201d not \u201cif appropriate.\u201d JA 288 (emphasis\nadded). While \u201cif appropriate\u201d indicates the Bankruptcy Court\n\n                              9\n\fhas a choice, the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d indicates it is\npermitted to determine what is pertinent given the specific\ncircumstances of each case. This interpretation\u2014that \u201cas is\nappropriate\u201d refers to the nature of the investigation, not the\nappointment of the examiner\u2014is further bolstered by the\ncontext. Immediately after the phrase \u201cas is appropriate,\u201d the\nstatute provides the word \u201cincluding\u201d and a list of topics that\nmerit investigation: \u201callegations of fraud, dishonesty,\nincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\nthe management of the affairs of the debtor of or by current or\nformer management of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c).\n\n        Under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s interpretation, the\nappointment of an examiner under either subsection of Section\n1104(c) would be subject to a court\u2019s discretion and a judge\nwould have the final say as to whether an investigation was\nwarranted. But this interpretation runs counter to the statute\u2019s\nplain language and established canons of construction.\nWhereas subsection 1104(c)(1) permits a court to consider \u201cthe\ninterests of creditors, any equity security holders, and other\ninterests of the estate,\u201d subsection (c)(2) allows for no such\nconsideration. We agree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nthat \u201c[t]he contrast\u201d between the two subsections \u201ccould not be\nmore striking.\u201d In re Revco D.S., Inc., 898 F.2d 498, 501 (6th\nCir. 1990). There is no weighing of interests in subsection\n1104(c)(2); the court is only permitted to determine whether\nthe unsecured debt minimum of $5 million has been met. Id.\nIf we ignore the differences between the plain text of the two\nsubsections, then subsection (c)(2) becomes discretionary and\nindistinguishable from subsection (c)(1). Such a reading\nwould defy the \u201cusual rules of statutory interpretation\u201d by\nassuming that \u201cCongress adopt[ed] two separate clauses in the\nsame law to perform the same work.\u201d United States v. Taylor,\n596 U.S. 845, 857 (2022). We make no such assumption here.\n\n       In addition to contravening rules of statutory\nconstruction, reading subsection (c)(2) as discretionary would\nrequire disregarding direct evidence of Congress\u2019s intent.5 In\n\n5\n The Bankruptcy Code was enacted after a \u201ccompromise bill\u201d\npassed both houses of Congress in October 1978. See Leonard\nL. Gumport, The Bankruptcy Examiner, 20 Cal. Bankr. J. 71,\n91 (1992). When proposing the bill to Congress, the sponsors\n                              10\n\fobtaining passage of the Bankruptcy Code, the Senate floor\nmanager explained the \u201cbusiness reorganization chapter\u201d\nensures \u201cspecial protection for the large cases having great\npublic interest.\u201d 124 CONG. REC. 33990 (1978). Such\nprotection comes from a provision guaranteeing an\n\u201cautomatically appointed\u201d examiner in large cases, a measure\ndesigned to \u201cpreserve[] and enhance[]\u201d debtors\u2019 and creditors\u2019\ninterests, \u201cas well as the public interest.\u201d Id. The Code\u2019s\nsponsors agreed that, in cases where the \u201cfixed, liquidated,\nunsecured debt\u201d reached $5 million, the appointment of an\nexaminer is required \u201cto [ensure] that adequate investigation of\nthe debtor is conducted to determine fraud or wrongdoing on\nthe part of present management.\u201d 124 CONG. REC. 32403\n(1978). To guarantee that \u201cthe examiner\u2019s report will be\nexpeditious and fair,\u201d the sponsors forbade the examiner from\nacting as or representing a trustee in the bankruptcy and\nrequired that the investigation remain separate from the\nreorganization process.6 Id. at 32406. In enacting Chapter 11,\nthe sponsors adopted a revised approach where the needs of\n\nof that legislation, Representative Edwards and Senator\nDeConcini, made \u201cnearly identical statements . . . to their\nrespective chambers.\u201d Id. at 91\u201392. These statements are\n\u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of the legislation\u2019s intent. See Begier v.\nIRS, 496 U.S. 53, 64 n.5 (1990) (\u201cBecause of the absence of a\nconference and the key roles played by Representative\nEdwards and his counterpart floor manager Senator\nDeConcini, we have treated their floor statements on the\nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 as persuasive evidence of\ncongressional intent.\u201d).\n6\n  The Bankruptcy Code \u201cprohibits an examiner from serving as\na trustee or as counsel for the trustee in order to ensure that\nexaminers may not profit from the results of their work.\u201d In re\nBig Rivers Elec. Corp., 355 F.3d 415, 430 (6th Cir. 2004).\nSuch independence distinguishes examiners from other\nparticipants in the Chapter 11 bankruptcies who may\ninvestigate wrongdoing but who also seek to benefit financially\nfrom the reorganization plan. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(b)(1)\n(members of the creditors\u2019 committee \u201cshall ordinarily\u201d consist\nof either the seven largest creditors or those who organized\nbefore the filing of the petition).\n\n                              11\n\fsecurity holders are balanced against \u201cequally important public\nneeds relating to the economy, such as employment and\nproduction, and other factors such as the public health and\nsafety of the people or protection of the national interest.\u201d Id.;\nsee also Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 53 (2002) (\u201c[T]he\nBankruptcy Code incorporates traditional equitable\nprinciples.\u201d). Because subsection 1104(c)(2) was enacted to\nprotect the public interest in larger bankruptcy cases, a \u201crefusal\nto give effect to the mandatory language\u201d regarding the\nappointment of an examiner would result in a failure \u201cto give\neffect to the legislative intention.\u201d 7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6\n1104.03[2][b] (16th ed. 2023).\n\n        Despite this clear intention to protect the public interest,\nCongress tempered the mandatory nature of subsection\n1104(c)(2) by making both the request for an examiner and the\nscope of the investigation subject to acts of discretion. First,\nan examiner is not automatically appointed in cases where $5\nmillion of unsecured debt exists. Rather, the U.S. Trustee or a\nparty in interest must deem one necessary and motion the court.\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(b). While the Debtors argue granting\ndiscretion to every party in interest is illogical and encourages\nabuse, they provide no evidence to support either position.\nThat a party in interest may abuse its discretion by requesting\nan examiner is not grounds for deeming Congress\u2019s grant of\nsuch discretion absurd.7\n\n\n7\n  At argument, the government stated that during the fiscal year\nof 2022, the U.S. Trustee filed fewer than ten motions to\nappoint examiners. Transcript of Oral Argument at 6:20\u201323,\nFTX Trading Ltd. (Nov. 8, 2023) (No. 23-2297). He further\nnoted that there has been no evidence of a \u201cfallout\u201d from the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s decision in In re Revco D.S., Inc., 898 F.3d at\n501, which held the appointment of an examiner is mandatory\nunder subsection 1104(c)(2) in 1990, over thirty years ago. Id.\nat 6:16\u201318; see also George M. Treister & Richard B. Levin,\nFundamentals of Bankruptcy Law 369\u201371 (7th ed. 2010)\n(\u201cRequests for an examiner are infrequent, in both large and\nsmall Chapter 11 cases.\u201d). In any case, courts must \u201cgive effect\nto [a] plain command, even if doing that will reverse the\nlongstanding practice under the statute.\u201d Lexecon Inc., 523\nU.S. at 35 (citations omitted).\n                                12\n\f       Second, while a bankruptcy court must appoint an\nexaminer if the statutory requirements are met, the phrase \u201cas\nis appropriate\u201d in Section 1104(c) means the court \u201cretains\nbroad discretion to direct the examiner\u2019s investigation,\u201d\nincluding its scope, degree, duration, and cost. 5 Norton\nBankr. L. & Prac. \u00a7 99:25 (3d ed. 2023); see also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n330(a)(3). By setting the investigation\u2019s parameters, the\nbankruptcy court can ensure that the examiner is not\nduplicating the other parties\u2019 efforts and the investigation is not\nunnecessarily disrupting the reorganization process.\nMoreover, to the extent the mandatory nature of subsection\n1104(c)(2) encourages parties in interest to invoke an\ninvestigation to tactically delay proceedings, the bankruptcy\ncourt has the discretion to continue with the confirmation\nprocess without receiving the examiner\u2019s findings or public\nreport. 7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1104.03[2][b] (16th ed.\n2023).\n\n        In this instance, the Bankruptcy Court denied the\nmotion for an examiner in part because it deemed Mr. Ray to\nbe \u201ccompletely independent\u201d from FTX\u2019s founding members\nand that any remaining prior officers \u201chave been stripped of\nany decision making authority.\u201d JA 9\u201310. On appeal, the\ndebtors in possession and the Creditors\u2019 Committee argue an\ninvestigation would be duplicative and wasteful given their\nongoing efforts to uncover all pre-petition mismanagement.\nNeither position is relevant, given our holding that the\nappointment of the examiner is mandatory under the Code. But\nnor is either position persuasive, given that Congress has\nguaranteed that an investigation under subsection 1104(c)(2)\nwould differ from those conducted by the Appellees in several\nsignificant ways. 8\n\n\n8\n  The duties of an examiner are set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1106(a)(3) and (4), which provide that an examiner shall,\n\u201cexcept to the extent that the court orders otherwise,\u201d\ninvestigate \u201cthe acts, conduct, assets, liabilities, and financial\ncondition of the debtor, the operation of the debtor\u2019s business\nand the desirability of the continuance of such business, and\nany other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a\nplan;\u201d and then \u201cfile a statement of any investigation,\u201d which\nmust include any fact \u201cpertaining to fraud, dishonesty,\n                                13\n\f         First, an examiner must be \u201cdisinterested\u201d as defined by\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14), which means a \u201ccreditor, an equity\nsecurity holder, or an insider,\u201d or anyone with \u201can interest\nmaterially adverse to the interest of the estate\u201d cannot be\nappointed to conduct a Section 1104(c) investigation.9 See 11\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1104(d). The Code also forbids a debtor in\npossession, the quintessential \u201cinsider,\u201d from performing the\nduties of an examiner and investigating itself. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1107(a) (stating a debtor in possession \u201cshall have all the rights\n. . . and powers\u201d and \u201cperform all the functions and duties\u201d of\na trustee, except the duties granted to trustees and examiners in\nsubsections 1106(a)(2) through (4)). An examiner \u201cis first and\nforemost disinterested and nonadversarial\u201d and \u201canswers\nsolely to the Court.\u201d In re Big Rivers Elec. Corp., 355 F.3d\n415, 432 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Baldwin United Corp.,\n46 B.R. 314, 316 (S.D. Ohio 1985)). This requirement of\ndisinterest is particularly salient here, where issues of potential\nconflicts of interest arising from debtor\u2019s counsel serving as\npre-petition advisors to FTX have been raised repeatedly.\nMoreover, the U.S. Trustee raised the concern that, given the\nreports of widespread fraud, officers or employees who may\nhave engaged in wrongdoing could remain at FTX Group. JA\n100 \u00b6 35. In enacting subsection 1104(c)(2), Congress made\ncertain that neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the Appellees\ncould deem these issues unworthy of an outside investigation\nin this particular bankruptcy, which certainly qualifies as a\n\n\n\n\nincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\nthe management of the affairs of the debtor, or to a cause of\naction available to the estate.\u201d\n9\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, a \u201cdisinterested person\u201d is\ndefined as a person that \u201cis not a creditor, an equity security\nholder, or an insider;\u201d \u201cis not and was not, within 2 years before\nthe date of the filing of the petition, a director, officer, or\nemployee of the debtor;\u201d and \u201cdoes not have an interest\nmaterially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of\ncreditors or equity security holders, by reason of any direct or\nindirect relationship to, connection with, or interest in, the\ndebtor, or for any other reason.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(A)\u2013(C).\n\n                                14\n\f\u201clarge case[] having great public interest.\u201d 124 CONG. REC.\n33990 (1978).\n\n        Second, an examiner appointed under subsection\n1104(c)(2) must make their findings public, an obligation\nneither a creditor committee nor a debtor in possession\nshares.10 Compare 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2) and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1107(a), with \u00a7 1106(a)(4), (b). Requiring a public report\nfurthers Congress\u2019s intent to protect the public\u2019s interest as\nwell as those creditors and debtors directly impacted by the\nbankruptcy. Such protection seems particularly appropriate\nhere. The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its\nworldwide investors but also raised implications for the\nevolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry. For example,\nan investigation into FTX Group\u2019s use of its own\ncryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and\nAlameda Research could bring this practice under further\nscrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed\ncredit risks in other cryptocurrency companies. In addition to\nproviding much-needed elucidation, the investigation and\nexaminer\u2019s report ensure that the Bankruptcy Court will have\nthe opportunity to consider the greater public interest when\napproving the FTX Group\u2019s reorganization plan.11\n\n\n10\n  The public report requirement is set forth in 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1106\n(a)(4)(A) and \u00a7 107(a). Section 1106(a) sets forth the duties of\nan examiner. Subsection 1106(a)(4) directs an examiner to\n\u201cfile a statement of any investigation\u201d which includes \u201cany fact\nascertained pertaining to fraud, dishonesty, incompetence,\nmisconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the\nmanagement of the affairs of the debtor, or to a cause of action\navailable to the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a)(4)(A). Such a\nstatement is deemed public under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(a).\n\n11\n    At argument, counsel for the unsecured Creditors\u2019\nCommittee posited that examiners in large-scale bankruptcies\nare not appointed as a matter of course and cited three\nexamples: In re Genesis Global Holdco, LLC., No. 1:23-bk-\n10063, ECF 1 et seq. (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2023), In re\nVoyager Digital Holdings, Inc., No. 1:22-bk-10943, ECF 1 et\nseq. (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2022), In re JCK Legacy Co.,\n                              15\n\f       IV.    Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the\nBankruptcy Court and remand with instructions to order the\nappointment of an examiner under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c)(2).\n\n\n\n\nNo. 1:20-bk-10418, ECF 1 et seq.

COVEY, Judge\n            HONORABLE STACY WALLACE, Judge\n            HONORABLE MARY HANNAH LEAVITT, Senior Judge\n\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBY JUDGE WALLACE                                    FILED: January 19, 2024\n\n\n      Ahmad S. Mrad (Mrad) appeals from the order of the Court of Common Pleas\nof Blair County (trial court) dated January 17, 2023, and entered on January 24,\n2023, granting the Altoona City Code Department\u2019s (Code Department) preliminary\nobjections (Preliminary Objections) and dismissing Mrad\u2019s complaint (Complaint)\nwithout prejudice. On appeal, Mrad argues the trial court should have granted him\na default judgment because the Code Department did not timely file its Preliminary\nObjections. Upon review, we affirm.\n                                 I.    Background\n      On November 23, 2022, Mrad filed the Complaint in the trial court against the\nCode Department seeking compensation for the Code Department\u2019s demolition of a\nresidential property he owned at 1616 3rd Street, Altoona, Pennsylvania 16601\n\f(Property). See Original Record (O.R.), Item No. 1. A Deputy with the Blair County\nSheriff\u2019s Office served Mrad\u2019s Complaint on the Code Department on December 9,\n2022. O.R., Item No. 6. On December 30, 2022, the Code Department filed the\nPreliminary Objections, asserting the trial court should dismiss Mrad\u2019s Complaint\nbecause it did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted and lacked\nsufficient specificity. O.R., Item No. 8. The Preliminary Objections also asserted\ngovernmental immunity insulated the Code Department from any potential claims\nrelating to its demolition on the Property. Id.\n       After reviewing Mrad\u2019s Complaint, the Preliminary Objections, and the Code\nDepartment\u2019s supporting memorandum of law, the trial court determined Mrad\u2019s\n\u201cComplaint fails to state a sufficient legal and factual basis for his requested relief.\u201d\nSee O.R., Item No. 9. As a result, the trial court dismissed Mrad\u2019s Complaint without\nprejudice. Id. Mrad appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court.1 On appeal, Mrad\nraised only one question for our review: whether the Code Department filed its\nPreliminary Objections in a timely manner.\n                                       II.    Analysis\n       In reviewing an order sustaining preliminary objections to the legal\nsufficiency of a pleading, our \u201cstandard of review . . . is de novo, and our scope of\nreview is plenary.\u201d       Raynor v. D\u2019Annunzio, 243 A.3d 41, 52 (Pa. 2020).\nPennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1026(a) (Rule 1026(a)) provides that \u201cevery\npleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed within twenty days after service\nof the preceding pleading.\u201d        Pa.R.Civ.P. 1026(a).      Preliminary objections are\npleadings. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1017(a)(4).\n\n\n1\n  Mrad originally appealed to the Superior Court. However, by order filed March 3, 2023, the\nSuperior Court transferred the matter to this Court.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      When a defendant does not file a responsive pleading within Rule 1026(a)\u2019s\n20-day time period, the defendant is in default. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 237.1, 1037. When\na defendant is in default and the plaintiff wishes to obtain a default judgment, the\nplaintiff must provide written notice of his intention to do so at least 10 days before\nfiling a praecipe for a default judgment. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 237.1(2)(ii). If the\ndefendant does not file a responsive pleading within 10 days of the plaintiff\u2019s notice,\nthe plaintiff may obtain a default judgment against the defendant by filing a praecipe\nfor a default judgment. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1037. A defendant may, however, cure his\ndefault by filing a responsive pleading at any time before the plaintiff files a praecipe\nto enter a default judgment. See Mazur v. Cuthbert, 186 A.3d 490, 497 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2018).\n      In Mazur, the defendant did not file a responsive pleading to the plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint within Rule 1026(a)\u2019s 20-day time period. Id. at 496. The plaintiff in\nMazur served the defendant with a 10-day notice of her intention to seek entry of a\ndefault judgment. Id. The defendant responded by quickly filing preliminary\nobjections to the original complaint. Id. A total of 25 days passed between service\nof the complaint and the defendant\u2019s filing of preliminary objections. Id. The trial\ncourt ultimately sustained the defendant\u2019s preliminary objections. Id. On appeal,\nthe plaintiff argued the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s preliminary\nobjections because the defendant filed them beyond Rule 1026(a)\u2019s 20-day time\nperiod. Id.\n      In Mazur, we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument, noting that \u201c[o]nce [the\ndefendant\u2019s] preliminary objections were filed, which occurred before the filing of\na praecipe to enter a default judgment, [the defendant] was no longer in default.\u201d\nMazur, 186 A.3d at 497 (citations omitted). In Mazur, this Court also explained it\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f\u201chas previously noted that the 20-day pleading requirement has not been strictly\nenforced, that said rule is not mandatory but permissive, and that common pleas\ncourts are afforded discretion in accepting late pleadings in the absence of prejudice\nand where justice so requires.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n      Here, the Code Department admits it filed the Preliminary Objections 21 days\nafter being served with Mrad\u2019s Complaint. In the single day the Code Department\nwas in default, Mrad took no steps to serve the Code Department with notice of his\nintention to pursue a default judgment. Nor did Mrad file any response to the Code\nDepartment\u2019s Preliminary Objections. Like the defendant in Mazur, the Code\nDepartment\u2019s filing of the Preliminary Objections before Mrad filed a praecipe for\na default judgment cured the Code Department\u2019s default. See id. Therefore, like in\nMazur, we reject Mrad\u2019s argument the trial court erred in granting the Preliminary\nObjections simply because the Code Department filed them beyond Rule 1026(a)\u2019s\n20-day time period. See id. at 496-97.\n                                   III.   Conclusion\n      For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting the\nCode Department\u2019s Preliminary Objections and dismissing Mrad\u2019s Complaint\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                              STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f        IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nAhmad S.

RESIDENT OBLIGATIONS\n\n               Resident agrees to:\n\n       ....\n\n       (10) not engage in, and cause family members, guests, other persons on\n       the premises with Resident\u2019s consent and other persons under\n       Resident\u2019s control to not engage in any criminal activity or drug related\n       criminal activity on or off the premises. Drug related activity is the\n       illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, use or possession of a controlled\n       substance, or the possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n       (11) act, and cause family members, guests, other persons on the\n       premises with Resident\u2019s consent and other persons under Resident\u2019s\n       control to act, in a cooperative manner with [Housing Authority] staff\n       and other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled\n       by [the Housing Authority], and refrain from acting or speaking in an\n       abusive or threatening manner toward [Housing Authority] staff and\n       other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled by\n       [the Housing Authority];\n\n       ....\n\n       R. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n\n\ndismissal in this Court, arguing Tenant failed to file and serve a designation of the contents of the\nreproduced record, in violation of Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2154(a), Pa.R.A.P.\n2154(a). The Housing Authority also argued Tenant\u2019s reproduced record did not comply with\nRule of Appellate Procedure 2152(a), Pa.R.A.P. 2152(a), because it did not contain the relevant\ndocket entries. The Housing Authority also objected to the reproduced record because it omitted\nrelevant portions of the trial transcript and the Housing Authority lacked the ability to correct the\nomissions due to Tenant\u2019s failure to designate the contents of the reproduced record. By order\ndated July 11, 2023, this Court denied the Housing Authority\u2019s application for dismissal, noting\nthe Housing Authority did not suffer any prejudice because \u201cthe Court has the original record to\nexamine in its review.\u201d Therefore, we have reviewed the original record and will cite to it\nexclusively.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f             This agreement may be terminated by [the Housing Authority]\n       only for a violation of a material term of this agreement . . . . Violations\n       of material terms of this agreement include, but are not limited to:\n\n       ....\n\n       (10) any illegal or other activity, including but not limited to disorderly\n       behavior or alcohol abuse by [Tenant] . . . which interferes with the\n       health, safety, or the right of peaceful enjoyment of other persons\n       residing in, on, or in the immediate vicinity of property belonging to or\n       controlled by [the Housing Authority] or [its] staff;\n\nId. at 7-8, 14-15.\n       On August 25, 2021, the Housing Authority served Tenant with a letter\n(Termination Notice) notifying him that it was terminating his Lease due to Tenant\u2019s\nfailure to comply with numerous Lease provisions, including the Resident\nObligations found in Section K (10) and K (11). O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. B. The\nTermination Notice also informed Tenant he needed to vacate his apartment within\n30 days or face eviction proceedings. Id. Tenant did not vacate his apartment,2 and\nthe Housing Authority initiated eviction proceedings in the local magisterial district\ncourt. O.R., Item No. 5 at 3. On December 9, 2021, the local district court entered\njudgment in favor of the Housing Authority and against Tenant, granting the\nHousing Authority possession of the apartment and awarding damages in the amount\nof $169.25. O.R., Item No. 1.\n       On December 20, 2021, Tenant appealed the local district court\u2019s judgment to\nthe trial court. Id. On August 24, 2022, the trial court held a bench trial on Tenant\u2019s\n\n2\n    Instead, Tenant filed a grievance under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. Pursuant to\nSection R of the Lease, \u201c[w]hen [Tenant] invokes the grievance procedure involving a\ntermination\/vacate notice, the [Housing Authority] shall not enforce the request to vacate until\nafter final disposition of the grievance.\u201d O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. A at 16. The Housing Authority\nwas, however, permitted to file an eviction action after the expiration of the 30-day notice period.\nId. Since the grievance process took more than 30 days to complete, the Housing Authority filed\nits eviction action while it was still processing Tenant\u2019s grievance. See O.R., Items No. 1-5.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fappeal. See generally T.T. 8\/24\/22.3 At trial, the Garden Towers\u2019 property manager\n(Property Manager) testified and explained the Garden Towers has 98 apartment\nunits which are occupied by low-income elderly and disabled individuals. See id. at\n10-11. The Garden Towers also has one smoking and one non-smoking outdoor\npavilion, each with picnic tables, for its residents\u2019 use and enjoyment. Id. at 20.\nAfter receiving reports of incidents involving Tenant and reviewing Tenant\u2019s file,\nProperty Manager wrote the Termination Notice and served it on Tenant. Id. at\n15-17.\n       Property Manager explained that the Housing Authority provided Tenant with\nthree written notices to remove his personal grill and smoker from the non-smoking\npavilion in June and July of 2019. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 21-22. When Tenant did not\ncomply, the Housing Authority was forced to cut the chains Tenant placed on the\nitems in order to remove them. Id. at 21-25. Property Manager also explained\nTenant was provided written notice that he violated the Lease when he engaged in\nverbal altercations with other residents. See id. at 23. Finally, Property Manager\nshowed the trial court several documents the Kittanning Borough Police Department\n(Police Department) provided to the Housing Authority indicating the Police\nDepartment charged Tenant with harassment, and Tenant ultimately pled guilty. Id.\nat 26, 34. Property Manager opined that Tenant engaged in \u201crepeated, disruptive\nbehavior\u201d which made the other residents feel unsafe. Id. at 35-36.\n       Donald Blose (Officer Blose), a police officer for the Police Department,\ntestified that the police have responded to numerous incidents involving Tenant. T.T.\n8\/24\/22 at 42-43. Officer Blose explained that several residents expressed they were\n\n3\n   \u201cT.T. 8\/24\/22\u201d refers to the transcript of the bench trial in this matter, which the Honorable\nChase G. McClister conducted on August 24, 2022. Although this transcript was included with\nthe trial court\u2019s original record, it was not given an item number.\n\n\n                                               4\n\fgoing to move out of the Garden Towers to get away from Tenant. Id. at 45. Officer\nBlose filed charges of harassment and disorderly conduct against Tenant for three\nseparate incidents. Id. at 45-47. Officer Blose also opined that many of the problems\nwith Tenant stemmed from him \u201caggressively approaching people on Garden\nTowers\u2019 property telling them to wear a mask.\u201d Id. at 49.\n      Shannon Atherton (Atherton), whose mother resides at the Garden Towers,\ntestified about witnessing Tenant\u2019s aggressive behavior. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 56-57. On\nJune 17, 2021, Atherton watched Tenant approach the front of the building, look at\nthe non-smoking pavilion, realize someone else was in the pavilion, act \u201clike\nTerminator,\u201d march to the other resident, and inform the other resident the pavilion\nwas his spot and that the other resident needed to leave. Id. at 58. Tenant demanded,\nmultiple times, that the other resident leave, \u201cpounding his fists on the table like an\nangry child.\u201d Id. at 59. The other resident left, and Tenant would not permit him to\nsit anywhere outside, yelling until the other resident completely left the area. Id.\nTenant then went to the smoking pavilion and demanded a second resident give\nTenant the second resident\u2019s food stamp card. Id. at 59-60. When the second\nresident shook his head no, Tenant said \u201c[k]eep it up. Keep it up or you know what\nyou are going to get.\u201d Id. at 60.\n      Donna D. Myers (Myers), a resident at the Garden Towers, testified Tenant\nthreatened her on an elevator on June 26, 2021. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 64. Myers explained\nthe incident occurred after she got on the Garden Towers\u2019 small elevator and Tenant\nrushed in behind her. Id. at 65. The ride started out normally, until Tenant bragged\nabout a new, five-layered face mask and Myers did not respond. Id. at 66. Tenant\nthen \u201cgot extremely enraged at [Myers],\u201d and began chanting about how someone\nwas going to kill her because she was not vaccinated. Id. at 66-67. Myers explained\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fTenant then began \u201cviolently shaking his arm, his great big fist and his index finger\nin my face.\u201d Id. at 67. Tenant then stopped, waited approximately twenty seconds,\nand did the same thing a second time. Id. at 67-68. Myers was terrified and believed\nTenant would hurt or kill her on this elevator ride. Id. at 68-69. Myers requested to\nbe moved to a different building after the incident and was still fearful of Tenant at\nthe time she testified before the trial court. Id. at 68-70.\n      Frankie Wolmeldorf (Wolmeldorf), a former resident of the Garden Towers,\ntestified that Tenant followed him around constantly and made him feel\nuncomfortable. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 74, 76-77. Wolmeldorf moved out of the Garden\nTowers because of Tenant\u2019s behavior. Id. at 78.\n      Joseph Boston (Boston), a resident of Garden Towers, testified Tenant has\nthreatened him for years and will not leave him alone. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 81. Boston\nrecalled one specific incident that occurred at a nearby grocery store. Id. Boston\ndrove to the grocery store and Tenant, who was riding his bicycle, followed Boston\ninto the grocery store parking lot. Id. at 82. Tenant got off his bicycle and told\nBoston \u201c[y]ou are nothing but an asshole and I am going to beat the shit out of you.\u201d\nId. Tenant then \u201cstarted picking his bicycle up and slamming it up and down and\nusing a bunch of profanity.\u201d Id. Tenant ultimately returned to the Garden Towers\nwithout physically assaulting Boston. Id. On multiple other occasions, Boston\nwitnessed Tenant stand beside another resident who is terminally ill with liver cancer\nand mock her, saying \u201cwhoa, whoa. My liver is hurting.\u201d Id. at 83. Noting that\nTenant is very strong, Boston explained that he lives in fear for his life and health\nbecause he does not have a safe place to live. Id. at 83-84.\n      The Housing Authority\u2019s Executive Director (Executive Director) testified\nthat she was the hearing officer for Tenant\u2019s appeal of the Termination Notice under\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 88-89, 93. The Executive\nDirector explained that after she heard testimony in Tenant\u2019s grievance appeal of the\nTermination Notice, she concluded\n\n       the residents were clearly fearful of living in the building. Again, they\n       referred to [Tenant] as a bully on the playground and felt that he\n       pr[e]yed on those who were most vulnerable in the building. . . . The\n       majority of residents are either elderly and\/or disabled. They are all\n       low income. Most of them don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, so they\n       [are] fearful of losing their home.\n\n       In my opinion, the evidence at that point established that [Tenant] had,\n       in fact, engaged in serious and repeated violations of the [L]ease,\n       mainly concerning the safety of the other residents.\n\nId. at 92-93. Executive Director confirmed she upheld the Termination Notice and\ndenied Tenant\u2019s request for relief under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy.\nId. at 93.\n       Tenant testified on his own behalf. See T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 103-54. Tenant denied\nany wrongdoing for each incident the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses testified about\nand gave his own version of the facts for some of the incidents. Id. at 109-29. Tenant\nshowed the trial court security camera footage, which did not have any sound, of\ntwo of the incidents in question. Id. at 130-38. On cross examination, Tenant\nadmitted he was in the army, is 6\u02b9 2\u02ba tall, weighs 235 pounds, and lifts weights\nregularly at a local gym. Id. at 138-39.\n       When questioned about why the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses all testified to\nfacts which contradicted his testimony, Tenant asserted the other residents are part\nof a conspiracy against him. Id. at 144. Tenant also asserted the Police Department\nand the Housing Authority are part of this conspiracy. Id. at 147.      Tenant stated\nthere were two reasons for the conspiracy: jealousy and politics. Id. at 148. With\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\frespect to politics, Tenant asserted the conspirators were \u201canti-vaxxers and anti-\nmask and . . . politically on the far right.\u201d Id. With respect to jealousy, Tenant\nclaims he \u201cwon numerous art contests and [is] a self-taught artist\u201d who has about\n45-50 paintings in his room. Id. at 150. Tenant also claimed that \u201csome [of his\npaintings] are worth $10,000.\u201d Id. Despite this claim, Tenant admitted he only ever\nsold one piece of his artwork \u2013 for $40. Id. at 150-51.\n       After reviewing the evidence, the trial court issued the following brief\nfindings of fact:\n\n       1. [Tenant] did not cooperate with the reasonable requests of [the]\n          Housing Authority staff regarding the grill and smoker at the\n          pavilion in violation of Paragraph K (11) of the [Lease].\n\n       2. [Tenant] did engage in criminal activity off the premises, which\n          resulted in a guilty plea, in violation of Paragraph K (10) of the\n          [Lease].\n\n       3. [Tenant] did speak in an abusive manner towards one or more\n          persons residing in [the Garden Towers] in violation of Paragraph\n          K (11) of the [Lease].\n\nO.R., Item No. 14. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Housing\nAuthority. See id. In the trial court\u2019s opinion filed under Pennsylvania Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 1925(a), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the trial court explained it based\nits finding of fact on its conclusion the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses were credible\nand \u201cTenant\u2019s blanket denials of any improper behavior were not credible.\u201d O.R.,\nItem No. 23 at 5.\n       Tenant appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court.4 On appeal, Tenant\nargues the trial court based its decision on insufficient evidence, and the trial court\n\n4\n   Tenant originally appealed to the Superior Court. However, by order filed November 10, 2022,\nthe Superior Court transferred the matter to this Court.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fcommitted legal errors in determining he violated Section K (10) and K (11) of the\nLease.\n                                    II.    Analysis\n      Our review of a non-jury trial verdict is limited to determining whether\nsubstantial evidence supports the findings of the trial court and whether the trial\ncourt committed an error in applying the law.            See Pottstown Sch. Dist. v.\nMontgomery Cnty. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, 289 A.3d 1142, 1145 n.3 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2023) (citation omitted). We must give the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact\n\u201cthe same weight and effect on appeal as the verdict of a jury.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\u201cWe consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner . . . and\nwill reverse the trial court only if its findings of fact are not supported by\n[substantial] evidence in the record.\u201d       Id. (citation omitted). When the issue\n\u201cconcerns a question of law, our scope of review is plenary,\u201d meaning we look at\nthe entire record. Id.\nA. Substantial Evidence\n      We begin with Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported\nby substantial evidence. Tenant believes two of the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses\ncould not have been credible because security camera footage of the incidents\ncontradicts their testimony. First, we note Tenant acknowledged the security camera\nfootage did not include any sound. See T.T. 8\/24\/22 at 149. Second, we note the\ntrial court did not admit the security camera footage into evidence because Tenant\nfailed to include it in his pretrial statement. See id. at 153-55. Because the trial court\ndid not admit the security camera footage into evidence, we cannot consider it in\ndetermining whether the trial court\u2019s determination was based upon sufficient\nevidence. See Pa.R.A.P. 1921 (providing that only original papers, exhibits, and\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\ftranscripts filed in the trial court and certified docket entries \u201cshall constitute the\nrecord on appeal\u201d); Welsh v. Bulger, 698 A.2d 581, 586 n.12 (Pa. 1997) (appellate\ncourts cannot consider any matter which is not part of the record on appeal).\n      To the extent Tenant argues the trial court watched the security camera\nfootage and those observations, combined with his testimony, should outweigh the\nHousing Authority\u2019s witnesses\u2019 contradictory testimony, we reject Tenant\u2019s\nargument. In addition to observing the security camera footage, the trial court\nobserved Tenant and the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses as they explained what was\nhappening during the incidents in question. The trial court determined the Housing\nAuthority\u2019s witnesses were credible and Tenant was not credible. We will not\ndisturb the trial court\u2019s credibility and weight of the evidence determinations on\nappeal. See Rice v. Compro Distrib., Inc., 901 A.2d 570, 574 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006)\n(\u201cThe trial court, as the finder of fact, has exclusive authority to weigh the evidence,\nmake credibility determinations, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented.\u201d).\n      Considering the evidence, which is summarized above, in the light most\nfavorable to the Housing Authority as the verdict winner, we conclude the record\ncontained substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination. Therefore,\nwe reject Tenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\nB. Section K (11) of the Lease\n      Tenant also argues the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal\nconclusion that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease because the terms\n\u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d in Section K (11) of the Lease are\nvague. See Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. We construe a contract \u201caccording to the meaning\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fof its language. The fundamental rule in construing a contract is to ascertain and\ngive effect to the intention of the parties. The intention of the parties must be\nascertained from the document itself, if its terms are clear and unambiguous.\u201d\nEmpire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Riverside Sch. Dist., 739 A.2d 651, 654 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1999).\n       We disagree with Tenant\u2019s belief that Section K (11) of the Lease is\nambiguous and not clear. Tenant\u2019s behavior, which made other Garden Towers\nresidents live in fear, was abusive, threatening, and not cooperative to his fellow\nresidents under any definition of those terms. Section K (11)\u2019s plain language,\nwhich reflects the Housing Authority\u2019s intention for its residents to be cooperative\nand respectful toward the Housing Authority staff and other residents, supports this\nconclusion. Accordingly, we reject Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court erred in\nconcluding Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease.5\n                                      III.   Conclusion\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings, and the trial\ncourt properly concluded Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease. Because this\nviolation alone entitled the Housing Authority to evict Tenant, we affirm the trial\ncourt\u2019s August 29, 2022 order entering judgment in favor of the Housing Authority\non its complaint in ejectment and breach of contract.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Housing Authority\u2019s complaint and\neject Tenant on the grounds that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease, we need not evaluate\nTenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal conclusion that\nTenant also violated Section K (10) of the Lease. Nevertheless, we note that Section K (10) does\nnot clearly establish whether all off-premises criminal activity or only off-premises drug-related\ncriminal activity violates the Lease.\n\n\n                                               11\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nHousing Authority of the County of    :\nArmstrong                             :\n                                      :\n          v.                          : No. 1413 C.D. 2022\n                                      :\nJoseph S.

The Rubinoffs contend the Foundation was\n\fnot entitled to fees and costs, or, alternatively, should have received fees and costs\nin a lesser amount. In addition, the Rubinoffs contend the orphans\u2019 court judge\ndisplayed bias against them and should have recused himself. H. William Doring\n(Doring), Thomas J. Balestrieri (Balestrieri), Joseph M. Jackovic (Jackovic), and the\nFoundation (collectively, Directors) appeal from the same order, but maintain the\norphans\u2019 court should have awarded the full amount of fees and costs they requested,\ntotaling approximately $1.5 million. After review, we reverse the award of fees and\ncosts but conclude the Rubinoffs failed to preserve their allegations of bias.1\n                                       I. Background\n       We detailed the extensive history of this case in a prior decision, In Re: Jack\nBuncher Foundation (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 306 C.D. 2019, filed July 1, 2020). Briefly,\nthe Foundation is a charitable nonprofit corporation named for prominent Pittsburgh\nbusinessman Jack Buncher (Jack). Jack had two children, Bernita Buncher (Bernita)\nand Stephen Buncher. The Rubinoffs are Bernita\u2019s children. Jack and several family\nmembers, including Bernita, formed the Foundation in 1974. Jack died in 2001. The\nFoundation\u2019s Board of Directors subsequently amended the articles of incorporation\nand bylaws in 2011 (2011 articles and bylaws). At the time of the amendments, the\nBoard of Directors included Bernita, Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic.\n       On April 12, 2017, the Rubinoffs filed a petition for rule to show cause.2 The\nRubinoffs alleged Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic exercised undue influence over\nBernita and breached their fiduciary duties by adopting the 2011 articles and bylaws.\nAmong other things, the Rubinoffs alleged the 2011 articles and bylaws contravened\n\n1\n The Commonwealth, through its counsel, the Office of Attorney General, filed a statement in this\nCourt indicating it would not be taking a position in these cross-appeals.\n\n2\n  The Rubinoffs initially filed a complaint in the Civil Division on July 26, 2016. The matter was\ntransferred to the orphans\u2019 court, where the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fJack\u2019s intent because they eliminated the right of his decedents to serve on the Board\nof Directors and redirected the Foundation\u2019s assets to causes he did not support. The\nRubinoffs requested the orphans\u2019 court declare the 2011 articles and bylaws invalid;\nreinstate prior versions of the articles and bylaws; remove Balestrieri, Doring, and\nJackovic from the Board of Directors; appoint one of the Rubinoffs to the Board of\nDirectors; and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n         The Directors filed an answer and new matter on May 8, 2017, in which they\ndenied the Rubinoffs\u2019 allegations and included their own request for attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. The Directors based their request on Count III of the petition for rule to\nshow cause, which the Rubinoffs brought \u201cderivatively on behalf of the Foundation\nand individually as presumptive directors\u201d against Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic\nunder Section 5782 of the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988 (Law), 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n5782. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 201a-02a (unnecessary capitalization omitted).\nThe Directors contended the Rubinoffs lacked standing to bring a derivative claim\nbecause they were not and never had been \u201cmembers\u201d of the Foundation as Section\n5782 required.3 Additionally, the Directors argued the Rubinoffs failed to comply\n\n3\n    The Law defines a \u201cmember\u201d as any of the following:\n\n         (1) A person that has voting rights in a membership corporation.\n\n         (2) When used in relation to the taking of corporate action by a membership\n         corporation, a delegate to a convention or assembly of delegates of members\n         established pursuant to any provision of this subpart who has the right to vote at the\n         convention or assembly in accordance with the rules of the convention or\n         assembly.\n\n         (3) A person that has been given voting rights or other membership rights in a\n         membership corporation by a bylaw adopted by the members pursuant to section\n         5770 (relating to voting powers and other rights of certain securityholders and other\n         entities) or other provision of law, but only to the extent of those rights.\n(Footnote continued on next page\u2026)\n\n                                                   3\n\fwith Section 5782(c), which required them to post security for reasonable expenses,\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees, that the Foundation might incur. The Rubinoffs filed a\nreply and answer to new matter on May 19, 2017. The Rubinoffs asserted they had\nstanding to pursue a claim under Section 5782 but denied it was necessary for them\nto post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d Reply to Answer\nand New Matter, 5\/19\/17, \u00b6 3.4\n       On May 31, 2017, counsel for the Rubinoffs, William Pietragallo, II, Esquire\n(Pietragallo), e-mailed counsel for the Directors, Joseph F. McDonough, Esquire\n(McDonough), to propose a \u201ccompromise.\u201d R.R. at 20a. Pietragallo explained the\nRubinoffs would provide him with $100,000 to be deposited in an interest-bearing\naccount, as security for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter an [o]rder\nawarding [attorneys\u2019] fees to [the Directors] and after any final appeal thereof.\u201d Id.\nMcDonough agreed to the compromise, proposing the Rubinoffs make their deposit\n\u201cwithout prejudice to [Pietragallo\u2019s] position that no fees\/expenses are recoverable\nand also without prejudice to [McDonough\u2019s] position that they are recoverable in\nan amount (whether more or less than the $100,000 deposit) to be determined by\nfinal [c]ourt [o]rder including available appeals.\u201d Id. at 21a.\n       The parties memorialized the compromise in a letter signed by Pietragallo and\nMcDonough and dated June 1, 2017. In the letter, Pietragallo explains:\n\n            Our law firm will establish an escrow account in the principal\n       sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) for the purpose of\n\n\n       (4) A shareholder of a corporation, if the corporation issues shares of stock.\n\nSection 5103(a) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103(a).\n\n4\n  Some of the Rubinoffs\u2019 pleadings, including their reply and answer to new matter, do not appear\nin the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f      providing security for any claim that the [Directors] may have\n      regarding attorneys\u2019 fees . . . should [the Directors] be awarded any\n      such attorneys\u2019 fees by the [c]ourt and, if appealed, sustained by a final\n      order of an appellate court.\n\nR.R. at 23a.\n      Moreover, a stipulated case management order, dated June 20, 2017, explains\nthe compromise as follows:\n\n      On or before June 15, 2017, counsel for [the Rubinoffs] will confirm to\n      counsel for [the Directors] in writing that [the Rubinoffs] have\n      deposited with counsel for [the Rubinoffs] the sum of $100,000 to be\n      held by counsel for [the Rubinoffs] in an interest-bearing account as\n      payment for counsel fees should the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter a final\n      [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section]\n      5782(c) or otherwise[.]\n\nR.R. at 26a.\n      The proceedings culminated in a nine-day hearing beginning July 9, 2018, and\nending July 19, 2018. By order dated February 12, 2019, the orphans\u2019 court denied\nthe Rubinoffs\u2019 requested relief while reserving the Directors\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. The orphans\u2019 court found the Directors did not exert undue influence\nover Bernita or breach their fiduciary duties when they adopted the 2011 articles and\nbylaws. The Rubinoffs appealed, and this Court affirmed on July 1, 2020. See Jack\nBuncher Foundation. The Rubinoffs filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which\nour Supreme Court denied on January 5, 2021.\n      Shortly thereafter, on March 19, 2021, the Directors filed a petition requesting\nnearly $1.5 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Directors once again relied on\nCount III of the petition for rule to show cause and Section 5782(c) of the Law. The\nDirectors averred they took a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d to the underlying litigation and\nsought to bring the dispute to a prompt conclusion while minimizing expenses. R.R.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fat 12a. They contrasted this with the Rubinoffs\u2019 \u201ccontumacious behavior,\u201d which\nincluded lengthy and unnecessary pleadings and discovery requests. Id. at 16a.\n       The Rubinoffs filed an answer and new matter on April 8, 2021. They argued\nSection 5782(c) did not permit the Directors to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In\nthe alternative, they argued any award should be limited to the $100,000 deposited\nunder the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017. The Rubinoffs averred they had already sent\na check for $101,869.58 to the Foundation \u201cnot because [the Rubinoffs] believed the\nFoundation was entitled to this amount, but because [they] thought it better that such\nsum went to charity rather than to counsel from both sides in a senseless fight over\nfees that are simply not due.\u201d Answer and New Matter, 4\/8\/21, \u00b6 47. The Rubinoffs\nnoted only Count III of their petition for rule to show cause was a derivative claim,\nand the underlying litigation was essentially a direct action.5\n       The orphans\u2019 court conducted a hearing on November 9, 2021. By order dated\nJanuary 28, 2022, the orphans\u2019 court directed the Rubinoffs to increase their posted\nsecurity to $500,000, which the Directors would be entitled to recover. The orphans\u2019\ncourt found the Foundation does not have any \u201cmembers\u201d under Section 5782. R.R.\nat 207a. The orphans\u2019 court concluded, despite this, that the parties agreed Section\n5782 permitted a nonprofit corporation to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred\nwhen successfully defending an action against itself or its directors. Id. at 209a. The\norphans\u2019 court acknowledged the Rubinoffs did not challenge the reasonableness of\nthe Directors\u2019 fees and costs, but it concluded the $1.5 million request was excessive,\nciting \u201cnumerous instances of duplicative billing, frequent \u2018revising,\u2019 and countless\nconferences between counsel in the same firm.\u201d Id. at 211a. The Rubinoffs\u2019 pursuit\n\n5\n The Directors filed a reply on April 13, 2021, and denied the averments in the Rubinoffs\u2019 new\nmatter. The Rubinoffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on May 28, 2021, which the\norphans\u2019 court denied by order dated July 27, 2021.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fof the litigation was not frivolous, the orphans\u2019 court noted, and necessarily involved\nextensive discovery. Id.\n       The Rubinoffs appealed to this Court, and the Directors cross-appealed.6 Both\nsets of parties challenged the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, with the Rubinoffs\narguing the Directors were not entitled to fees and costs, or, in the alternative, should\nhave received a lesser award, and the Directors arguing they should have received\nthe full amount of fees and costs requested. Moreover, the Rubinoffs raised a new\nclaim in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, maintaining the\norphans\u2019 court judge displayed bias against them and should have recused himself.\nThe orphans\u2019 court responded with an additional opinion, emphasizing the Rubinoffs\nnever alleged bias or requested recusal. It further emphasized its \u201cpatient[]\u201d conduct\nof the underlying litigation, which included numerous conferences and motions, and\na nine-day hearing. R.R. at 221a.\n                               II. Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\n       We begin our analysis with the Rubinoffs\u2019 challenge to the award of attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Primarily, this challenge requires us to consider whether the orphans\u2019\ncourt correctly interpreted Section 5782(c) of the Law. This is a question of law, for\nwhich our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Meyer\nv. Cmty. Coll. of Beaver Cnty., 93 A.3d 806, 813 (Pa. 2014) (citing Dechert LLP v.\nCommonwealth, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (Pa. 2010)). Stated differently, we do not defer\nto the orphans\u2019 court when reaching a decision, and we may review the entire record\non appeal. Mercury Trucking, Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 55 A.3d 1056, 1082\n\n\n6\n The Rubinoffs purport to challenge not only the January 28, 2022 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs order,\nbut also orders entered as part of the underlying litigation. See Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 2-3. This Court\nhas already heard an appeal from, and affirmed, the order resolving the underlying litigation, see\nJack Buncher Foundation, and only the January 28, 2022 order is properly before us.\n\n\n                                                7\n\f(Pa. 2012) (citing Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole),\n860 A.2d 25, 29 n.2 (Pa. 2004)).\n      Our research has revealed no prior decisions interpreting Section 5782(c). At\nthe time the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause in the orphans\u2019 court,\nSection 5782(a)-(c) provided as follows:\n\n      (a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action\n      or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one\n      or more members of a nonprofit corporation against any present or\n      former officer, director or member of an other body of the corporation\n      because the corporation refuses to enforce rights that may properly be\n      asserted by it, each plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear\n      that each plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the\n      transaction of which he complains.\n\n      (b) Exception.--Any member who, except for the provisions of\n      subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding\n      and who does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the\n      discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding\n      on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such\n      verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court,\n      that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on\n      behalf of the corporation and that without the action serious injustice\n      will result.\n\n      (c) Security for costs.--In any action or proceeding instituted or\n      maintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5%\n      of the members of any class of the corporation, the corporation in whose\n      right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage\n      of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the\n      reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by\n      the corporation in connection therewith or for which it may become\n      liable pursuant to section 5743 (relating to mandatory indemnification),\n      but only insofar as relates to actions by or in the right of the corporation,\n      to which security the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as\n      the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding.\n      The amount of security may from time to time be increased or\n      decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security\n      provided has or is likely to become inadequate or excessive. The\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an\n       evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious\n       injustice would result.\n\n15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782 (a)-(c).7\n       Section 5751(a) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5751(a), contemplates that members\nof a nonprofit corporation will be organized into \u201cclasses.\u201d It provides:\n\n       (a) General rule.--Membership in a nonprofit corporation shall be of\n       the classes, and shall be governed by the rules of admission, retention,\n       suspension and expulsion, prescribed in bylaws adopted by the\n       members, except that the rules shall be reasonable, germane to the\n       purpose or purposes of the corporation and equally enforced as to all\n       members of the same class. Unless otherwise provided by a bylaw\n       adopted by the members:\n\n              (1) There shall be one class of members whose voting and\n              other rights and interests shall be equal.\n\n              (2) If there is only one class of members, the members\n              shall have all the rights of members generally in a\n              nonprofit corporation.\n\nId.\nA. The Rubinoffs\u2019 arguments\n       The Rubinoffs maintain Section 5782 of the Law did not permit the orphans\u2019\ncourt to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them. Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 35-49. They\ncontend Section 5782 applies to \u201cmembers\u201d of a nonprofit corporation, which they\nare not. Id. at 44-49. The Rubinoffs deny they ever admitted Section 5782 permits\nan award against them and insist they challenged this during the proceedings below.\nId. at 35-38. They also emphasize Section 5782 applies to derivative claims, rather\n\n\n7\n The General Assembly amended Section 5782 after the orphans\u2019 court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. See Act of November 3, 2022, P.L. 1791. The amendment did not change the language\nof Section 5782 in a way that would have affected the outcome of the parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n\n                                             9\n\fthan direct claims. Id. at 44-45, 52-57. The Rubinoffs contend only one-half of one\nof the counts in the petition for rule to show cause was derivative, and the gravamen\nof their action was to recover for direct harm. Id. The Rubinoffs argue, to the extent\nthey must pay fees and costs, that they should pay 7.14% of the Directors\u2019 requested\naward, or $107,643.65, because only 7.14% of their total claims were derivative. Id.\nat 44-45, 57.\n      The Rubinoffs note, alternatively, that Section 5782(c) applies to \u201cmembers\nof any class.\u201d Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 49-52 (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). They describe\nthemselves as comprising nearly half of the \u201cclass\u201d of Jack\u2019s descendants, including\nBernita\u2019s grandchildren. Id. Therefore, they argue their action was not brought \u201cby\nless than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the members of any class\nof the corporation.\u201d Id. (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). The Rubinoffs propose the\nparties agreed to limit the potential attorneys\u2019 fees and costs awarded to the $100,000\nsecurity they posted during the underlying litigation. Id. at 28-29, 45.\nB. The Directors\u2019 arguments\n      The Directors contend Section 5782 applies because the Rubinoffs relied on\nit during the underlying litigation and raised derivative claims. Directors\u2019 Reply Br.\nat 18-34. The Directors also cite the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017, under which the\nRubinoffs agreed to post security while the litigation was pending. Id. The Directors\nmaintain Section 5782(c) specifies the minimum number of \u201cmembers\u201d that a group\nof plaintiffs or petitioners must have in order to be excused from paying attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Id. at 20-32. Because the Foundation has no members, the Directors\ncontend the Rubinoffs cannot meet Section 5782(c)\u2019s threshold. Id. at 25-32.\n      Additionally, the Directors challenge the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\nthe orphans\u2019 court awarded. Directors\u2019 Br. at 14-26. They argue the orphans\u2019 court\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fshould have awarded the $1.5 million they requested, rather than $500,000. Id. The\nDirectors defend the reasonableness of their $1.5 million request, characterizing the\nRubinoffs\u2019 approach to the underlying litigation as \u201caggressive.\u201d Id. at 16-19. The\nDirectors argue the Rubinoffs did not contest the reasonableness of the fees and costs\nincurred. Id. at 16-24. They acknowledge the orphans\u2019 court deemed some fees and\ncosts excessive but insist it failed to sufficiently explain how it arrived at a $500,000\nfigure. Id. at 15, 21-26. The Directors contend the belief that the Rubinoffs\u2019 petition\nfor rule to show cause was not frivolous does not justify a smaller award of fees and\ncosts. Id. at 14-15, 20.\nC. Analysis\n      Section 5782(c) of the Law applies to \u201cany action or proceeding instituted or\nmaintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the\nmembers of any class of the corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c) (emphasis added).\nThe orphans\u2019 court and the parties agree the Rubinoffs are not members, and, in fact,\nthe Foundation has no members. Accordingly, Section 5782(c) does not permit an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them.\n      Although the Directors contend Section 5782(c) sets a minimum threshold of\nmembers that plaintiffs must have to avoid paying attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, their\nargument is contrary to the remainder of the section. Section 5782(a) applies to \u201cany\naction or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more\nmembers of a nonprofit corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(a) (emphasis added). It\nexpressly requires that \u201ceach plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear that\neach plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the transaction of\nwhich he complains.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Section 5782(b) supplies an exception\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fto this rule, but it applies only to \u201c[a]ny member\u201d who fails to meet the requirements\nof Section 5782(a). 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(b) (emphasis added).\n      Moreover, our review of the record does not indicate the Rubinoffs \u201cagreed\u201d\nto pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Rubinoffs cited Section 5782 in Count III of\ntheir petition for rule to show cause. The Directors filed an answer and new matter,\ncontending the Rubinoffs lacked standing under Section 5782 because they were not\nmembers of the Foundation. Nonetheless, the Directors maintained the Rubinoffs\nfailed to post security as required under Section 5782(c). The Rubinoffs filed a reply\nand answer to new matter arguing they had standing under Section 5782 but denying\nit was necessary to post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d\nReply to Answer and New Matter, 5\/19\/17, \u00b6 3.\n      The parties reached a compromise, which they memorialized with a letter and\nstipulated case management order. R.R. at 23a-26a. Neither the letter nor the order,\nhowever, guaranteed the Rubinoffs would pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if they were\nunsuccessful in the underlying litigation. The letter stated the Directors \u201cmay have\u201d\na claim for fees and costs, while the order applied \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter\na final [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section] 5782(c) or\notherwise[.]\u201d Id.\n      When the Directors filed their petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, they based\ntheir request on the letter and stipulated case management order. The Directors also\nattached a copy of McDonough\u2019s e-mail to Pietragallo, recognizing the Rubinoffs\nwould make a deposit \u201cwithout prejudice to [their] position that no fees\/expenses\nare recoverable.\u201d R.R. at 21a (emphasis added). The relevant testimony during the\nhearing on November 9, 2021, focused on the circumstances surrounding the letter,\nthe order, and counsels\u2019 e-mails.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      We recognize the inconsistency of the Rubinoffs\u2019 litigation positions in this\nmatter, which included citing Section 5782 of the Law when it suited them and then\ncontending Section 5782(c) did not apply. Section 5782(a) should have prevented\nthis problem by prohibiting the Rubinoffs from bringing a derivative action if they\nwere not members of the Foundation. Neither the plain language of Section 5782(c),\nnor the parties\u2019 compromise, permitted the orphans\u2019 court to award attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs against individuals who were never members and who could not bring a\nderivative action in the first place. Therefore, we reverse the January 28, 2022 order\nand $500,000 award of fees and costs.\n                         III. Alleged Orphans\u2019 Court Bias\n      Issues not raised in the orphans\u2019 court are waived and cannot be raised for the\nfirst time on appeal. Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 302(a), Pa.R.A.P.\n302(a). Additionally, any party requesting the recusal or disqualification of a judge\nmust \u201craise the objection at the earliest possible moment, or that party will suffer the\nconsequence of being time barred.\u201d Lomas v. Kravitz, 170 A.3d 380, 389 (Pa. 2017)\n(quoting Goodheart v. Casey, 565 A.2d 757, 763 (Pa. 1989)). If a party discovers\nalleged evidence of bias after a case is over, he or she must establish \u201c1) the evidence\ncould not have been brought to the attention of the [orphans\u2019] court in the exercise\nof due diligence, and 2) that the existence of the evidence would have compelled a\ndifferent result in the case.\u201d Reilly v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 489 A.2d 1291, 1301\n(Pa. 1985).\n      Here, the Rubinoffs concede they did not request the orphans\u2019 court judge\u2019s\nrecusal before he ruled on the merits of the underlying litigation and issued the order\nawarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Rubinoffs\u2019 Reply Br. at 8-9. They instead argue\nthey raised the issue \u201cat the first opportunity to do so following the final [o]rder\u201d by\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fincluding it in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. Rubinoffs\u2019\nReply Br. at 8-9. We cannot accept the Rubinoffs\u2019 explanation. In their brief, the\nRubinoffs allege 12 \u201cegregious examples\u201d of bias, but 8 of those examples involve\ndecisions and statements the judge made in the underlying litigation. See Rubinoffs\u2019\nBr. at 35, 60-67. If the judge\u2019s decisions and statements were as \u201cegregious\u201d as the\nRubinoffs suggest, they had every opportunity to seek recusal earlier. Accordingly,\nthe Rubinoffs failed to preserve their claim of bias for our review.\n      Even reaching the merits of the Rubinoffs\u2019 argument, our review of the record\ndoes not show the orphans\u2019 court judge was biased against them. Recusal decisions\nare within the sound discretion of the judge whose recusal is sought. Dunn v. Bd. of\nProp. Assessment, Appeals & Rev., 877 A.2d 504, 517 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005) (citing\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 732 A.2d 1167 (Pa. 1999)). As our Supreme Court has\nexplained, \u201ceach judge has the primary responsibility for determining the validity of\na challenge to his or her participation in a given matter. . . . [T]he jurist requested to\nrecuse himself is the most capable to determine those factors hidden in the recesses\nof the mind and soul . . . .\u201d Goodheart, 565 A.2d at 763 (citations omitted).\n      The Rubinoffs\u2019 allegations are primarily an attempt to relitigate the orphans\u2019\ncourt ruling on the merits. Several examples of alleged bias challenge the conclusion\nthat Bernita was mentally competent when the Board of Directors adopted the 2011\narticles and bylaws. The Rubinoffs maintain the orphans\u2019 court \u201cignored\u201d Bernita\u2019s\nmental health diagnoses, Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 65, although the orphans\u2019 court discussed\nBernita\u2019s mental health at length in its opinions, see Orphans\u2019 Ct. Op., 2\/12\/19, at\n11-14; Orphans\u2019 Ct. Op., 4\/23\/19, at 4-7. Strikingly, the Rubinoffs present the award\nof attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them as four separate examples of bias, with each\nexample focusing on a different statement the orphans\u2019 court made or failed to make\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fin its opinions. Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 60-62. We agree the orphans\u2019 court misinterpreted\nSection 5782(c) of the Law and erred by awarding fees and costs. At the same time,\nthe orphans\u2019 court reduced the amount of fees and costs that the Rubinoffs would be\nrequired to pay, demonstrating an effort to treat both sets of parties fairly.\n                                   IV. Conclusion\n      For all the foregoing reasons, the orphans\u2019 court erred by awarding attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs to the Directors under Section 5782(c), and we reverse the orphans\u2019\ncourt order dated January 28, 2022. The Directors shall return any attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs already paid under the January 28, 2022 order within 30 days of the date\nof the attached order. The Rubinoffs failed to preserve their claim of orphans\u2019 court\nbias by not raising it sooner. Even reaching the merits of their claim, the Rubinoffs\nwould not be entitled to relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                               ______________________________\n                                               STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f          IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nIn re: Jack Buncher Foundation            : CASES CONSOLIDATED\n                                          :\nAppeal of: Amy Rubinoff, Caryn            :\nRubinoff, Michael Rubinoff, and           :\nDaniel Rubinoff                           : No. 291 C.D. 2022\n                                          :\n                                          :\nIn Re: Jack Buncher Foundation            :\n                                          :\nAppeal of: H.

The Trust argues that the\ntrial court erred in disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the\nsale conducted by the Schuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau (Bureau) complied with\nthe requirements set forth in the Real Estate Tax Sale Law (RETSL),1 including\nnotice of the pending upset tax sale to Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes\nprior to the sale date, and that the Bureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s\n\n      1\n          Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-5860.803.\n\fevidence that the Pennsylvania Homeowner Assistance Fund (PAHAF)2 would\nprovide the funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.3 After careful review, we\naffirm the trial court.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       The facts in this matter are undisputed. Due to $6,946.58 in delinquent real\nestate taxes, the Property was exposed to an upset tax sale on September 26, 2022,\nand sold to the Trust. Owner filed objections to the upset tax sale on November 23,\n2022, arguing that she notified the Bureau on September 22, 2022, that she received\nfunding to pay the outstanding taxes from PAHAF and that PAHAF had mailed a\ncheck in that amount to the Bureau. The Bureau refused to review the letter Owner\nprovided from PAHAF to substantiate the payment, which the Bureau received on\nthe date of the upset tax sale. Owner contended that the Bureau erred in refusing to\naccept the letter from PAHAF as evidence that the taxes would be paid, and she\nrequested that the trial court set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on Owner\u2019s objections on February 2, 2023.\nOwner testified on her own behalf and presented documentation from PAHAF\ndemonstrating that Owner had funding available to pay the delinquent taxes. The\nBureau presented the testimony of its interim Assistant Director, Deborah Dasch.\n\n\n       2\n          PAHAF is a program funded by the United States Department of the Treasury and\nadministered by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency that assists homeowners facing\nfinancial hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic. https:\/\/pahaf.org\/faqs\/ (last visited Jan.\n18, 2024). PAHAF\u2019s website indicates that it has paused new applications, effective February 1,\n2023.\n\n       3\n           We have reordered the Trust\u2019s arguments and consolidated issues to the extent they\noverlap. The Bureau filed a separate brief in which it adopted the Trust\u2019s arguments and also\nargued that, once Owner had notice of the upset tax sale and failed to pay the outstanding taxes\nprior to the date of sale, the trial court had no authority to set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        Owner acknowledged that she was delinquent in paying the 2020 real estate\ntaxes on the Property and that she received notice of the pending upset tax sale at the\nbeginning of September 2022. After receiving notice of the upset tax sale, Owner\ncontacted the Bureau to find out the total amount of delinquent taxes owed.\nThereafter, Owner filed an application with PAHAF for assistance with paying the\ndelinquent taxes, which PAHAF approved. On September 22, 2022, Owner received\nan email from PAHAF with an attached letter indicating that a check for $6,946.58\nwas mailed to the Bureau in satisfaction of the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes. The\nletter from PAHAF provided the pertinent tax account information, along with\nOwner\u2019s name and the Property\u2019s address. PAHAF\u2019s letter provided an email\naddress and telephone number should the Bureau have any questions.\n\n        Owner contacted the Bureau to confirm it received the payment from PAHAF.\nBased on a conversation Owner had with the Bureau\u2019s staff, Owner understood that\nPAHAF\u2019s check had not yet arrived, and that the Bureau would not accept the letter\nPAHAF emailed to Owner as proof of payment. Instead, PAHAF had to contact the\nBureau directly. After speaking with someone from PAHAF, Owner believed that\nPAHAF forwarded the September 22, 2022 letter to the Bureau. Approximately two\nweeks later, Owner was notified by \u201c[s]omebody\u201d that the Property had been sold at\nthe September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 89.4\n\n        Ms. Dasch testified that the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes had to be paid by 4:30\np.m. on September 23, 2022, before the Property would be removed from the upset\ntax sale. Regarding the assistance available through PAHAF, Ms. Dasch advised\n\n        4\n          The Trust\u2019s reproduced record does not comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2173, which requires that\n\u201cthe pages of . . . reproduced record . . . shall be numbered separately in Arabic figures . . . followed\nby a small a[.]\u201d The Trust failed to include the small \u201ca\u201d in its page numbers. Therefore, the\ncitations herein reflect those in the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fher contacts with PAHAF of the September 23, 2022 payment deadline. If payment\nwas not received by September 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m., the Bureau required that\nsomeone affiliated with PAHAF send the Bureau an email confirming that PAHAF\nwas \u201cin the process of cutting a check\u201d and that the delinquent taxes were\n\u201cguaranteed to be paid.\u201d Id. at 105. If PAHAF could provide proof that a taxpayer\nqualified for assistance, the Bureau would \u201cpause\u201d the upset tax sale of the\nassociated property. Id. at 108. Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she received an email\nfrom Karmesha Pitt, a servicing specialist with PAHAF, on September 21, 2022, in\nwhich Ms. Pitt requested the total amount of taxes owed for the Property; however,\nMs. Dasch did not receive any confirmation from PAHAF that Owner\u2019s application\nwas approved or that PAHAF had issued a check to cover the Property\u2019s delinquent\ntaxes. Ultimately, the Bureau received PAHAF\u2019s check for $6,946.58, along with\nPAHAF\u2019s September 22, 2022 letter, on September 26, 2023, after the Property had\nbeen sold. Ms. Dasch testified that, had she received an email from PAHAF before\n4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, the Bureau would have paused the upset tax sale\nof the Property.\n\n      During cross-examination, Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she \u201cmay have\u201d\nspoken with Owner in the week prior to the upset tax sale and that nothing would\nhave prevented her from reviewing the letter Owner received from PAHAF. Id. at\n111. Ms. Dasch stated that the Bureau does not accept such letters from taxpayers,\nhowever, because they could modify an email to \u201cmake it say whatever they want it\nto say.\u201d Id. at 112. Ms. Dasch conceded that, if she \u201chad the time[,]\u201d she could have\nreached out to PAHAF to confirm that the letter Owner would have provided was\nlegitimate; however, Ms. Dasch advised that her office is \u201cswamped with work and\ncustomers and phone calls\u201d prior to an upset tax sale. Id. at 118.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      The Bureau submitted into evidence two email exchanges between Ms. Dasch\nand PAHAF staff. In an August 31, 2022 email, Sharon Gagel, a servicing specialist\nwith PAHAF, inquired of Ms. Dasch as to the last date upon which upset tax sales\ncould be stayed, and whether Ms. Dasch would \u201caccept an email that a grant ha[d]\nbeen drafted . . . .\u201d Id. at 140. Ms. Dasch replied that she had been given the\nauthority to \u201c\u2018pause\u2019 any property for which [PAHAF] can provide proof that the\nowner is qualified for the program and a check will be sent to us.\u201d Id. If Ms. Gagel\nprovided the information prior to 4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, Ms. Dasch\nwould \u201cpause the parcel in question to get it off the sale.\u201d Id. The September 21,\n2022, email Ms. Dasch received from Ms. Pitt requested tax information specific to\nOwner and the Property. Ms. Pitt advised that Owner was seeking financial\nassistance from PAHAF and that time was \u201cof the essence[.]\u201d Id. at 140. In her\nresponse, Ms. Dasch attached several documents detailing the taxes owed on the\nProperty, and she advised Ms. Pitt to \u201clet [her] know if [she] had any questions.\u201d Id.\nat 130.\n\n      The trial court issued an order and opinion on February 10, 2023, sustaining\nOwner\u2019s objections and disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. The trial\ncourt noted that Ms. Dasch could have confirmed Owner\u2019s receipt of funding from\nPAHAF, as Ms. Dasch had previously corresponded with PAHAF staff by email.\nMs. Dasch did not dispute the legitimacy of the September 22, 2022 letter Owner\nwished to forward or refute that PAHAF sent funds prior to the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.   The trial court rejected Ms. Dasch\u2019s explanation that her office is\nunderstaffed and busy in the week prior to an upset tax sale. Although Owner\nindisputably failed to pay the real estate taxes on the Property, the trial court found\nthat Owner took appropriate steps to apply for emergency funding from PAHAF.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fAfter PAHAF approved her application, Owner contacted the Bureau to provide\ndocumentation that she had funding to cover the delinquent taxes on the Property,\nwhich the Bureau refused to review. The trial court recognized that PAHAF\n\u201cappear[ed] to have dropped the ball[,]\u201d as Owner advised PAHAF that it should\ncontact the Bureau directly. Id. at 32. Regardless, the trial court observed that the\nBureau \u201cworks for the people and not the other way around[,]\u201d suggesting that the\nBureau could hire more staff if it was overly busy, particularly given the Bureau\u2019s\nawareness of the emergency funding program administered by PAHAF. Id. The\ntrial court deemed the Bureau\u2019s staffing issues an insufficient reason to divest Owner\nof her property when confirmation of payment was available. Ultimately, the trial\ncourt concluded that allowing the upset tax sale of the Property to go forward would\npunish Owner, who did \u201ceverything within her power to pay the delinquent taxes on\nor before the deadline.\u201d Id. at 33.\n\n       This appeal followed.5\n\n                                              II. Issues\n\n       On appeal, the Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the\nSeptember 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with the\nrequirements set forth in the RETSL, including notice of the pending upset tax sale\nto Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes prior to the sale date, and that the\nBureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s evidence that PAHAF would provide\nthe funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.\n\n\n\n       5\n         This Court\u2019s scope of review in tax sale cases is limited to determining whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion, rendered a decision that lacks supporting evidence, or clearly erred as\na matter of law. Nguyen v. Del. Cnty. Tax Claim Bureau, 244 A.3d 96, 101 n.3 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2020).\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                   III.   Discussion\n\n      \u201c[I]t is a momentous event . . . when a government subjects a citizen\u2019s\nproperty to forfeiture for the non-payment of taxes.\u201d Tracy v. Chester Cnty. Tax\nClaim Bureau, 489 A.2d 1334, 1339 (Pa. 1985). The primary purpose of RETSL is\nnot to strip away a citizen\u2019s property rights but to ensure the collection of taxes. In\nre Consol. Reports and Return by Tax Claims Bureau of Northumberland Cty. of\nProp., 132 A.3d 637, 651 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (internal citations omitted). \u201cPrior to\nthe sale of real property for unpaid taxes, a tax claim bureau must give a taxpayer\nnotice and opportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Jenkins v. Fayette Cnty. Tax Claim\nBureau, 176 A.3d 1038, 1044 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018) (emphasis in original).\n\n      The Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the September 26,\n2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with all requirements in RETSL\nand Owner indisputably received notice of the upset tax sale. The Trust contends\nthat the trial court imposed burdens on the Bureau that do not appear in RETSL,\nsuch as accepting Owner\u2019s evidence that she received funding from PAHAF or\ncontacting PAHAF to confirm Owner\u2019s receipt of same. Additionally, the Trust\nargues that the trial court erred in finding that Owner provided the Bureau with\nadequate proof that the delinquent taxes would be paid and in disallowing the upset\ntax sale based on the Bureau\u2019s refusal to accept Owner\u2019s proof of payment by\nPAHAF. The Trust notes that the Bureau would not accept proof from Owner due\nto potential fraud and PAHAF did not provide the required communication by\nSeptember 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m. RETSL does not mandate that a tax claim bureau\naccept a property owner\u2019s \u201cpotentially fraudulent communication\u201d from PAHAF or\nrequire that a tax claim bureau take affirmative steps to confirm a property owner\u2019s\nacceptance into the PAHAF program. Trust\u2019s Br. at 19.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      In disallowing the upset tax sale, the trial court relied on Jenkins, in which this\nCourt upheld the setting aside of an upset tax sale where the taxpayer attempted to\npay her delinquent taxes three days before the sale and the county tax claim bureau\n\u201cimproperly refused\u201d her payment. Jenkins, 176 A.3d at 1043. We rejected the\nargument that the county tax bureau had fully complied with RETSL because,\n\u201c[p]rior to the sale of real property for unpaid taxes, a tax claim bureau must give a\ntaxpayer notice and opportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Id. at 1044 (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n      The facts in Jenkins differ somewhat from the instant appeal, as Owner\nindisputably did not pay the taxes prior to the upset tax sale. It is clear from Ms.\nDasch\u2019s testimony, however, that had PAHAF presented proof prior to the\nSeptember 23, 2022 deadline that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau would have\nremoved the Property from the upset tax sale. The Bureau would not consider the\nidentical proof offered by Owner well in advance of the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.\n\n      The Trust is correct that RETSL does not require a tax claim bureau to take\naffirmative steps to confirm that payment of delinquent taxes is forthcoming. This\nCourt has declined to find that an affirmative duty exists on the part of a tax claim\nbureau where a corresponding statutory right of the taxpayer does not also exist. For\nexample, in Matter of Tax Sale 2018-Upset, 227 A.3d 957 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020), this\nCourt held that a tax claim bureau did not have an affirmative duty to notify\ntaxpayers of the option to enter into an installment agreement for the payment of\ndelinquent taxes because Section 603 of RETSL, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.603, did not create\na statutory right for the payment of taxes in installments. Rather, installment\npayments were an option to be determined by the tax claim bureau.\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      This Court has held that an affirmative duty exists, however, where a statute\ngrants an individual \u201can actual entitlement\u201d or \u201can unqualified right to receive the\nbenefit[.]\u201d Miller v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Pavex, Inc.), 918 A.2d\n809, 812-13 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2007). In such a situation, the individual is entitled to\nprotection under the due process clause. Instantly, per Jenkins, Owner was entitled\nto have the \u201copportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Jenkins, 176 A.3d at 1044\n(emphasis in original). To that end, Owner received funding from PAHAF to cover\nthe delinquent taxes, the proof of which she attempted to provide to the Bureau. The\nBureau refused to review the substantiating documentation Owner received directly\nfrom PAHAF, despite the Bureau\u2019s policy of pausing the sale of properties for which\nPAHAF could provide proof that an owner qualified for relief from PAHAF and\nprovide confirmation that payment would be sent. While Ms. Dasch testified that\nonly documentation sent directly by PAHAF was acceptable, her August 31, 2022\nemail to Ms. Gagel did not specify that a property owner could not forward\ninformation received from PAHAF, and there is no dispute that the letter Owner\nwished to present to the Bureau was a copy of the letter PAHAF mailed to the\nBureau.\n\n      Ultimately, the Bureau created a policy that offered Owner an additional\nopportunity to cure the delinquent taxes on the Property \u2013 a policy that the Bureau\nfailed to follow when it rejected the proof of payment Owner obtained from PAHAF.\nThus, Owner\u2019s opportunity to cure was essentially illusory, as Owner was forced to\nrely on the assurances of PAHAF that it sent the requisite proof. As noted above,\nthe purpose of RETSL is to ensure the collection of taxes, not to strip a taxpayer of\nher property. While Owner obtained funding to pay the delinquent taxes on the\nProperty, and obtained proof that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau elected to\n\n\n                                         9\n\fstrip Owner of her property instead. Under the specific facts of this case, the\nBureau\u2019s concerns that taxpayers would manipulate an email to \u201cmake it say\nwhatever they want it to say,\u201d are simply insufficient to justify disposing of the\nProperty at an upset tax sale. R.R. at 112.\n\n      The Trust argues that Owner is solely responsible for not paying the\ndelinquent taxes on the Property, resulting in its sale. It suggests that the trial court\u2019s\ndecision to grant Owner\u2019s exceptions creates a slippery slope that would permit\nobjections to a tax sale for reasons beyond a tax claim bureau\u2019s failure to comply\nwith RETSL. The Trust contends that, should this Court affirm the trial court, any\ntaxpayer could prevent an upset tax sale by submitting a fraudulent document\nindicating that a third party had committed to paying the taxes.\n\n      We are not convinced by the Trust\u2019s argument, as the instant appeal presents\nspecific and unique facts, and our holding herein is limited to those circumstances.\nMoreover, Ms. Dasch testified that an upset tax sale would only be paused based on\npayment by a government-funded program. The Bureau\u2019s policy would not apply\nwhere payment was guaranteed by a private individual.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\nsustaining Owner\u2019s objections to the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale.\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court.\n\n                                          __________________________________\n                                          ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\n\nKristen Moyer                       :\n                                    :\n      v.                            : No. 241 C.D. 2023\n                                    :\nSchuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau :\nand Commonwealth Commerce, LLC, :\nas Trustee for the 010722 Portfolio :\nTrust                               :\n                                    :\nAppeal of: Commonwealth             :\nCommerce, LLC, as Trustee for the :\n010722 Portfolio Trust              :\n\n\n                                ORDER\n\n\n     AND NOW, this 19th day of January, 2024, the February 10, 2023 order of\nthe Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n                                   __________________________________\n                                   ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\f","         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nKimberly D.

Morgan (Morgan) and the\nStotesbury Community Association, Inc. (Association) appeal the Court of Common\nPleas of Montgomery County\u2019s (trial court) order dated August 31, 2022 (Order),\nwhich granted in part and denied in part Morgan\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\n\ffees and costs and denied the Association\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees and\ncosts. After review, we affirm.\n         The trial court aptly set forth the factual background underlying this dispute\nin its Rule 1925(a) Opinion,1 dated Dec. 6, 2022 (Trial Court Opinion), as follows:\n\n         The planned community, known as Stotesbury, is located in Springfield\n         Township. Stotesbury was created pursuant to a Declaration of\n         Community Covenants, Restrictions and Easements dated September\n         26, 1979, and recorded with the Recorder of Deeds (\u201cthe Declaration\u201d).\n         [The Association] is the unit owners\u2019 association for Stotesbury. It is\n         governed by a Board of Directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d), subject to the\n         Declaration and the Bylaws of the Association. [Morgan] is the owner\n         of a residential townhouse unit in Stotesbury.\n\n         At the time that [Morgan] purchased her unit in November 1990, a\n         retaining wall (\u201cthe Old Wall\u201d) had been installed. The length of the\n         Old Wall was located approximately 50% in [Morgan\u2019s] backyard,\n         within the boundaries and near the rear border of her unit, and\n         approximately 50% on adjacent property that was common area owned\n         by the Association. Beginning in 2004 and continuing thereafter,\n         [Morgan] notified the Association, through its property management\n         company and the Board, that the Old Wall was deteriorating and falling\n         apart. The Association was not responsive.\n\n         In 2014, [Morgan] engaged Max L. Lieberman, Esquire, [(Morgan\u2019s\n         Counsel)] to press her concerns to the Association. By letter to the\n         property manager dated December 14, 2015, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel]\n         reiterated [Morgan\u2019s] concerns about the Old Wall and the need to\n         replace it. Enclosed with the letter was the report of an engineering\n         firm engaged by [Morgan], recommending replacement of the Old\n         Wall. At a meeting of the Board on March 24, 2016, the Board\n         discussed that the Old Wall needed to be replaced.\n\n         The Old Wall functioned as a single structure and could only be\n         replaced in toto. The Board engaged a contractor for removal and\n         replacement of the Old Wall for the sum of $7,685. The Board did not\n         consult with or collaborate with [Morgan] in the selection of the\n         contractor or of the design for the replacement wall.\n\n1\n    See Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fBy letter dated September 29, 2016, Stefan Richter, Esquire, [(the\nAssociation\u2019s Counsel)] . . . notified [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] that [Morgan]\nwould be responsible for one-half of the cost of the work and that if she\nrefused to pay, the Association would sue her to recover this amount\ntogether with costs and attorney fees. By a responsive letter dated\nOctober 6, 2016, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] informed [the Association\u2019s\nCounsel] that [Morgan] objected to paying half the cost and also that\nshe considered the proposed design of the replacement wall to be\ninadequate. Enclosed with the letter were a report from another\nengineering firm engaged by [Morgan] and estimates from two\ncontractors for the more extensive work that [Morgan] was demanding.\n\nOn or about October 24, 2016, the Association\u2019s contractor removed\nthe Old Wall and installed a replacement wall (\u201cthe New Wall\u201d). The\nNew Wall was erected in substantially the same location as the Old\nWall, with the design to which [Morgan] had objected. Like the Old\nWall, the New Wall functions as a single structure and can only be\nreplaced in toto.\n\nBy letter to [the Association\u2019s Counsel] dated November 28, 2016,\n[Morgan\u2019s Counsel] stated that the New Wall was inadequate and\nneeded to be replaced. Enclosed with the letter was a supplemental\nengineering report regarding the New Wall. Also enclosed was an\n\u201cinvoice\u201d rendered by [Morgan] to the Association for fees from the\ntwo engineering firms she had engaged and for [Morgan\u2019s Counsel\u2019s]\nfees. By letters to [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] dated January 5, 2017, and\nMarch 24, 2017, respectively, [the Association\u2019s Counsel] reiterated\nthe Association\u2019s demand for payment by [Morgan] of one-half of the\n$7,685 cost of the New Wall \u2013 i.e., $3,842.50. The March 24 letter\nagain threatened suit if payment was not made.\n\n[Morgan] commenced this action against the Association by Writ of\nSummons on October 2, 2018. Her Complaint, filed January 22, 2019,\nasserted five counts. Count I sought a declaratory judgment that, inter\nalia, [Morgan] is not responsible for one-half of the cost of replacing\nthe Old Wall and that the Association bears sole responsibility for the\nmaintenance, repair, and replacement of the New Wall as necessary.\nCount I also sought unspecified damages, punitive damages, and\nattorney fees. Counts II (injunctive relief), III (nuisance) and IV\n(breach of contract) sought injunctive relief and monetary damages,\nincluding attorney fees, on the ground that the New Wall was\ninadequate and needed to be replaced. Count V, for implied contract,\n\n\n                                   3\n\f         quasi-contract, and unjust enrichment, sought recovery of the\n         engineering fees that [Morgan] had incurred.\n\n         [A n]onjury trial was held on June 15 and 16, 2022. At the outset of\n         trial, it was agreed that any award of attorney fees incurred in\n         connection with the litigation would be reserved and would be raised\n         by motion after issuance of the Court\u2019s decision. That procedure was\n         reconfirmed at the close of the trial.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12\/6\/22, at 1-4 (footnotes, headnotes and internal citations\nomitted).\n         On June 23, 2022, the trial court issued its decision on the underlying dispute.\nThe trial court determined under the Uniform Planned Community Act (Act),2 the\nAssociation bore the sole responsibility for replacing the Old Wall and maintaining\nthe New Wall. Id. at 4. Therefore, it found in favor of Morgan on Count I, but did\nnot award compensatory damages because the Association had paid its contractor in\nfull for the replacement of the Old Wall, and it did not award punitive damages\nbecause it found the Association had not acted willfully. Id. at 6. On Counts II\nthrough IV, the trial court found the New Wall was structurally sound and in good\ncondition and did not need to be replaced. Id. Therefore, the trial court found in\nfavor of the Association. Id. Similarly, as to Count V, for unjust enrichment, the\ntrial court found in favor of the Association. Id. Neither party challenged the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision.\n         On July 5, 2022, both Morgan and the Association filed motions seeking an\naward of attorney fees and costs. Morgan sought an award of $280,066.13. The\nAssociation sought an award of approximately $81,860.80.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5414.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      In its Order, the trial court granted Morgan\u2019s request, in part, by awarding her\nattorney fees in the amount of $50,000. The trial court denied the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees entirely. The trial court explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n      In determining the parties\u2019 respective requests for fees and costs under\n      [S]ection 5412 of the [Act], the [trial court] has considered primarily\n      the following factors . . . .\n\n   \u2022 This dispute arose from the Association\u2019s repeated insistence that\n     [Morgan] bear one-half the expense of replacing the Old Wall and its\n     threats to sue her to recover that amount. As the [trial court\u2019s d]ecision\n     explains, while this position was apparently asserted by the Association\n     in good faith, it did not represent a reasonable interpretation of the Act.\n     But for the Association\u2019s position, it is possible that litigation would\n     have been avoided.\n\n   \u2022 At the same time, the [trial court] found [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall to be without sufficient supporting evidence.\n     These issues accounted for the great majority of time spent on discovery\n     and trial. [Morgan\u2019s] persistence in seeking to require the Association\n     to remove and rebuild the New Wall made settlement of this matter\n     especially difficult. Unlike the Association\u2019s position on the cost of\n     replacing the Old Wall, however, [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall were not unreasonable.\n\n   \u2022 In the attorney invoices submitted by [Morgan], the descriptions of the\n     subject matter of work performed are heavily redacted. As a result, the\n     allocation of time spent between the issues on which [Morgan]\n     prevailed and those on which she did not prevail is problematic.\n\n   \u2022 Section 5412 [of the Act] authorizes the [trial court], in a suit for\n     violation of the Act or the declaration or bylaws, to award costs and\n     reasonable attorney[] fees to the prevailing party \u201cif appropriate\u201d \u2013\n     language that vests the [trial court] with broad discretion. The\n     Association\u2019s reading of this provision \u2013 that it applies only when\n     punitive damages are awarded \u2013 is inconsistent with its language and\n     legislative history.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12\/6\/22, at 8.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f       On September 9, 2022, Morgan filed a motion for partial reconsideration of\nthe trial court\u2019s Order and on September 12, 2022, the Association responded with\na cross-motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order. On September 19,\n2022, the trial court denied both motions for reconsideration.\n       Both Morgan and the Association now appeal to this Court. On appeal,\nMorgan argues the trial court committed an error of law and abused its discretion by\nawarding her only $50,000 in costs and attorney fees when the statute authorizing\nthe award of attorney fees compelled an award of $280,066.13. Morgan\u2019s Br. at 4.\nRegarding the Association\u2019s request for attorney fees, Morgan contends the trial\ncourt properly exercised its discretion in denying the Association\u2019s request because\nthe trial court determined the Association\u2019s conduct to be unreasonable and an award\nof attorney fees and costs would not be appropriate. Id. Meanwhile, the Association\nasserts the trial court erred and abused its discretion by denying the Association\u2019s\nmotion for attorney fees and expenses in its entirety when the Association acted in\ngood faith and prevailed on the majority of the initial claims. Association\u2019s Br. at 5.\nRegarding the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Morgan, the Association\ncontends the applicable statutory scheme did not compel the trial court to award the\nfull amount of requested attorney fees to Morgan and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in awarding $50,000 in attorney fees and costs. Association\u2019s Third-Step\nBr. at 2, 5, 13.\n                                   DISCUSSION\n       Where an award of attorney fees is authorized by statute, we review the trial\ncourt\u2019s fee award under an abuse of discretion standard. Samuel-Bassett v. Kia\nMotors Am., Inc., 34 A.3d 1, 51 (Pa. 2011). An abuse of discretion requires a\n\u201cshowing of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fsuch lack of support as to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Wagner v.

We will not find \u201can abuse of\ndiscretion . . . merely because [we] might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d Id.\nSo \u201clong as the trial court reviews the record . . . it is difficult for an appellate court\nto hold a trial court abused its discretion in issuing a particular award of attorney\nfees.\u201d Arches Condo.

Penndale Water Line Extension v. Beaver Falls Mun. Auth.,\n960 A.2d 933, 940 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008). This Court will \u201cnot disturb a trial court\u2019s\ncredibility determinations where explained\u201d or obvious from the record. Id. Where\nthe trial court\u2019s discretion is challenged on appeal, the challenging party bears a\nheavy burden. Paden, 658 A.2d at 343. To the extent we address issues of statutory\ninterpretation, our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is de novo.\nSamuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 51. This means that as to these issues, we do not defer to\nthe trial court when reaching a decision and we review the entire record on appeal.\nMercury Trucking, Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 55 A.3d 1056, 1082 (Pa.\n2012) (citing Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole), 860\nA.2d 25, 29 n.2 (Pa. 2004)).\n       First, we address Morgan\u2019s argument that the trial court erred at law and\nabused its discretion when it awarded her $50,000 in attorney fees rather than the\n$280,066.13 she requested. Morgan asserts the \u201cstatutory scheme under the plain\nlanguage of the [Act] . . . compel[ ] that she be made whole and awarded\u201d her entire\nrequested amount. Morgan\u2019s Br. at 16.

Cmwlth. 1985);\nsee also Section 1726(a)(1) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1726(a)(1) (providing\nattorney fees are not an item of taxable costs except as permitted by Section 2503 of\nthe Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503, relating to the right of participants to receive\ncounsel fees, which is not at issue here). Here, the parties\u2019 underlying dispute arose\nunder the Act and Section 5412 of the Act, which provides:\n\n      If a declarant or any other person subject to this subpart violates any\n      provision of this subpart or any provisions of the declaration or bylaws,\n      any person or class of persons adversely affected by the violation has a\n      claim for appropriate relief. Punitive damages may be awarded in the\n      case of a willful violation of the subpart and, if appropriate, the\n      prevailing party may be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable\n      attorney fees.\n\n68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5412.\n      The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act), 1\nPa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1991, provides \u201c[t]he object of all interpretation and construction\nof statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Generally, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain\nlanguage of a statute. Commonwealth v. Shiffler, 879 A.2d 185, 189 (Pa. 2005). It\nis well settled that \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all\nambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its\nspirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a71921(b). Furthermore, we construe the words and phrases of a\nstatute \u201caccording to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved\nusage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\n      Section 5412 of the Act plainly provides \u201cif appropriate, the prevailing party\nmay be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n\n                                          8\n\f5412 (emphasis added). The use of the phrase \u201cif appropriate\u201d and the word \u201cmay\u201d\nare crucial in interpreting the meaning of the statute. \u201cAlthough \u2018may\u2019 can mean the\nsame as \u2018shall\u2019 where a statute directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice, it\nordinarily is employed in the permissive sense.\u201d Commonwealth v. Garland, 142\nA.2d 14, 17, n.5 (Pa. 1958) (internal citations omitted). Here, the word \u201cmay\u201d is\ncoupled with the phrase \u201cif appropriate.\u201d This plain permissive language leaves the\ndecision of whether to award attorney fees at all to the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt. Moreover, the statute is clear that any award of attorney fees must be\nreasonable.\n       Generally, the courts retain discretion to determine what is reasonable when\nawarding attorney fees. Oberneder v. Link Comput. Corp., 696 A.2d 148, 151 (Pa.\n1997). As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court outlined in In re Trust Estate of\nLaRocca,\n\n      the amount of fees to be allowed to counsel, always a subject of\n      delicacy if not difficulty, is one peculiarly within the discretion of the\n      court of first instance. Its opportunities of judging the exact amount of\n      labor, skill, and responsibility involved, as well as its knowledge of the\n      rate of professional compensation usual at the time and place, are\n      necessarily greater than ours[.]\n\n246 A.2d 337, 340 (Pa. 1968) (citation omitted). Thus, a trial court\u2019s award should\nbe based on \u201call the circumstances\u201d of a case and it is up to the court to determine\nwhether certain tasks constitute a reasonable legal response to an action or, instead,\nhave an attenuated relation to the action. Twp. of Millcreek v. Angela Cres Trust of\nJune 25, 1988, 222 A.3d 1199, 1208 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2019).\n      In LaRocca, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court outlined the specific factors to\nbe considered when determining reasonableness as follows:\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f         the amount of work performed; the character of the services rendered;\n         the difficulty of the problems involved; the importance of the litigation;\n         the amount of money or value of the property in question; the degree of\n         responsibility incurred; whether the fund involved was \u2018created\u2019 by the\n         attorney; the professional skill and standing of the attorney in his\n         profession; the results he was able to obtain; the ability of the client to\n         pay a reasonable fee for the services rendered; and, very importantly,\n         the amount of money or the value of the property in question.\n\nLaRocca, 246 A.2d at 339-40. Notably, the trial court need not address every\nLaRocca factor because any one or a combination of those factors may convince the\ntrial court a fee other than the requested fee is justified. Carmen Enters., Inc. v.\nMurpenter, LLC, 185 A.3d 380, 390 (Pa. Super. 2018) (citation omitted). Further,\nwhile the trial court must sufficiently explain its reasoning to enable meaningful\nappellate review, the trial court is not required to \u201cdelineate with specificity . . .\nevery reason for every disallowance of every aspect of the fee request.\u201d Twp. of\nMillcreek, 222 A.3d at 1206-07 (citing In re Appeal of Silverman, 90 A.3d 771, 786\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 2014)).\n         Initially, we reject Morgan\u2019s assertion that the plain language of the Act\nmandates she receive the full amount of her requested award. Morgan relies on\nSection 5114 of the Act,3 which provides the Act\u2019s provisions are to be \u201cliberally\nadministered to the end that the aggrieved party is put in as good a position as if the\nother party had fully performed.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114. Morgan contends this requires\nattorney fees authorized under Section 5412 of the Act \u201cmust be liberally awarded\nto make the aggrieved party whole.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 16. She interprets this to\nnecessitate an award equal to the full amount of her requested attorney fees.\nHowever, the plain language of the Act grants the trial court discretion whether to\naward attorney fees at all, and if it does, mandates the trial court to ensure awarded\n\n3\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fattorney fees are reasonable. To interpret the Act as Morgan suggests would\nobliviate the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining the reasonableness of attorney\nfees. Because the plain language of the statute requires the trial court ensure awarded\nattorney fees are reasonable, Morgan\u2019s interpretation of the Act would lead to an\nabsurd result whereby a court would be required to award attorney fees paid by the\nparty, even when those fees were unreasonable. A party is free to pursue all means\nand costs necessary in litigation, but it does not necessarily follow that the fees and\ncosts incurred are reasonable.         Therefore, we decline to adopt Morgan\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Act, which is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\n      Similarly, we reject Morgan\u2019s arguments that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by reducing her award of attorney fees. When determining its fee award,\nthe trial court considered the relative degrees of success of the parties in the\nunderlying litigation, the complexities of the legal issues involved, and the amount\nof work performed and required by the attorneys involved.               The trial court\ndetermined that because Morgan only \u201cprevailed\u201d on one of the issues before the\ntrial court, which was a less complex issue, a reduced award was warranted under\nthe circumstances. Morgan asserts the trial court improperly considered the redacted\nbilling statements as a basis to depart from the requested fee award and its award\nwas \u201carbitrarily selected.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 37. However, the redacted billing\nstatement was just one of the various factors considered by the trial court. Overall,\nthe trial court was familiar with the underlying dispute, the litigation, and the parties.\nThe trial court considered appropriate factors when fashioning a fair and reasonable\nattorney fee. The trial court\u2019s decision was not manifestly unreasonable, and the\ntrial court did not act with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will. Accordingly, we\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscern no legal error or abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award of $50,000 in\nattorney fees to Morgan.\n       Next, we turn to the Association\u2019s argument that the trial court erred or abused\nits discretion when it denied its request for attorney fees. The Association asserts\nbecause it prevailed on four out of five counts in the underlying dispute, the trial\ncourt erred by failing to award it attorney fees. The Association relies on this Court\u2019s\nholding in Serota v. London-Towne Homeowners\u2019 Association (Pa. Cmwlth., No.\n1451 C.D. 2017, filed Nov. 16, 2018).4 In Serota, an owner of numerous townhomes\nin a planned community filed suit against a homeowner\u2019s association challenging\nthe passage of an amendment that diluted the owner\u2019s voting power. Id., slip op. at\n1. After prevailing in the underlying dispute, the owner sought an award of attorney\nfees and costs under, inter alia, a previous version of Section 5412 of the Act, which\nnotably did not reference attorney fees. Id. The trial court rejected the owner\u2019s\nargument that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees and held the Act did not\nmandate an award of attorney fees. Id. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision. Id. In considering the language of the Act and the Uniform Law\nComment, we explained:\n\n       Contrary to [the owner\u2019s] contentions, however, neither the statutory\n       language of Section 5412 of the [Act] nor the Uniform Law Comment\n       mandate an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. As observed by [the trial court],\n       the statutory language at that time did not refer to attorneys\u2019 fees. And,\n       while the Uniform Law Comment does refer to attorneys\u2019 fees, such\n       reference is not binding on the court and, additionally, it considers the\n       award of such fees to be within the discretion of the court. Given the\n       parties\u2019 arguments before [the trial court], [the trial court] could have\n       exercised its discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees, but it was not\n       obligated to do so. We discern no abuse of discretion in [the trial\n\n4\n Under Section 414(a) of this Court\u2019s Internal Operating Procedures, 210 Pa. Code \u00a7 69.414(a),\nan unreported opinion of this Court may be cited as persuasive authority.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f      court\u2019s] decision not to award attorneys\u2019 fees, given the complexity of\n      the underlying litigation and [the trial court\u2019s] familiarity with the\n      litigation between these parties, including [the underlying lawsuit] and\n      a second lawsuit that was eventually settled.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n      Here, while the Association acknowledges the Serota holding in its brief, it\nasserts this decision supports its argument that the trial court erred or abused its\ndiscretion by failing to award it attorney fees. We disagree. Rather, our decision in\nSerota supports our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s determination. Here, just as in\nSerota, and as we explained above, the plain language of Section 5412 of the Act\ngrants the trial court discretion regarding whether to award attorney fees. We\nacknowledge the Association prevailed on numerous counts in the underlying\ndispute, but contrary to the Association\u2019s assertion, the Act does not mandate an\naward of attorney fees. The Association fails to point to any evidence in the record\nor any authority demonstrating the trial court\u2019s decision was manifestly\nunreasonable or the trial court acted with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will in\ndenying its request. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to award the Association attorney fees.\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      The trial court did not err or abuse its discretion when it issued its Order\ngranting, in part, Morgan\u2019s request for attorney fees and denying the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees. The plain language of Section 5412 of the Act grants the\ntrial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party. Moreover, the Act\nmandates the trial court ensure an award of attorney fees is reasonable. The trial\ncourt, familiar with the litigation and parties in the underlying dispute, properly\nconsidered various factors, including the complexity of the litigation, the degree of\nsuccess of the parties, and the amount of work necessary for the attorneys to properly\n\n                                         13\n\fconduct the litigation, in fashioning its fee award. Neither party demonstrated the\ntrial court\u2019s decision was manifestly unreasonable or the trial court acted with\npartiality, prejudice, or ill-will. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion\nunder the circumstances of this case. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                              STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f        IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nKimberly D.

For the\nreasons that follow, we overrule in part and sustain in part Respondents\u2019 preliminary\nobjections.\n              The petition for review, titled \u201cpetition for writ in mandamus and\/or\nextraordinary relief,\u201d alleges that Respondents failed to investigate, prosecute, or\ntake actions in response to a series of criminal assaults allegedly committed on\nWalker and Davis by Dwayne T. Jones. The petition further alleges that Petitioners\n\freported Respondents\u2019 alleged misconduct to the Office of Attorney General for\ninvestigation, which took no action.               The petition asks this Court to compel\nRespondents to initiate a criminal proceeding against Jones, and grant unspecified\ndamages and costs. The petition also asks this Court to compel the Office of\nAttorney General to initiate \u201can official internal investigation upon all factual\nallegations of said police\/prosecutorial misconduct pursuant to [34] USC []\n12601(b).\u201d1 Petition for Review at 30.\n                 In response, Respondents filed preliminary objections.2 The District\nAttorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections challenge the petition on\nthe following grounds. First, they argue that Stambaugh lacks standing to sue\nbecause the petition does not allege that he was personally aggrieved by Jones\u2019\nalleged criminal conduct or Respondents\u2019 actions. Second, they argue that the\npetition fails to conform to law because Stambaugh, who is not an attorney, signed\nthe petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. Third, they assert that the County has\n\n\n1\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a712601 states:\n\n          (a) Unlawful conduct\n          It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any\n          person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or\n          practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any\n          governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice\n          or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or\n          immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n          (b) Civil action by Attorney General\n          Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of\n          paragraph (1) has occurred, the Attorney General, for or in the name of the United\n          States, may in a civil action obtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to\n          eliminate the pattern or practice.\n\n2\n    The Office of Attorney General has not filed preliminary objections or an answer in this matter.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fgovernmental immunity under Section 8541 of what is commonly known as the\nPolitical Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act),3 and the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice is protected by official immunity under Section 8545 of the Tort Claims Act4\nas well as quasi-judicial immunity. Finally, they argue that any allegations related\nto damages should be stricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity.\n               The Mayor\u2019s Office also filed preliminary objections, which likewise\nseek to dismiss the petition based on the foregoing grounds.5\n               Initially,\n\n               [i]n ruling on preliminary objections, we must accept as true all\n               well-pleaded material allegations in the petition for review, as\n               well as all inferences reasonably deduced therefrom. The Court\n               need not accept as true conclusions of law, unwarranted\n               inferences from facts, argumentative allegations, or expressions\n               of opinion. In order to sustain preliminary objections, it must\n               appear with certainty that the law will not permit recovery, and\n               any doubt should be resolved by a refusal to sustain them.\n\nTorres v. Beard, 997 A.2d 1242, 1245 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) (internal citation\nomitted). Further, \u201ccourts reviewing preliminary objections may not only consider\n\n\n3\n 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78541. It states, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency\nshall be liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act\nof the local agency or an employee thereof or any other person.\u201d\n4\n  42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78545. It states, \u201c[a]n employee of a local agency is liable for civil damages on\naccount of any injury to a person or property caused by acts of the employee which are within the\nscope of his office or duties only to the same extent as his employing local agency and subject to\nthe limitations imposed by this subchapter.\u201d\n5\n The Mayor\u2019s Office also sought to dismiss the petition for improper service. By order dated\nSeptember 28, 2022, the Court asked Petitioners to serve the petition, with all exhibits attached,\non Respondents in person or by certified mail as required by PA. R.A.P. 1514(c) and file with the\nCourt a certificate of service within 14 days. Petitioners did so on October 7, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fthe facts pled in the [petition for review], but also any documents or exhibits attached\nto it.\u201d Allen v. Department of Corrections, 103 A.3d 365, 369 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014).\n             With these principles in mind, we consider Respondents\u2019 preliminary\nobjections seriatim.\n                           I.      Stambaugh\u2019s Standing to Sue\n             First, Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenge Stambaugh\u2019s\nstanding to sue because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions. The petition alleges that Jones committed a\nseries of criminal assaults on Davis and Walker, and Respondents took no actions in\nresponse. As to Stambaugh, the petiton alleges that he filed a private criminal\ncomplaint on behalf of Walker with the District Attorney\u2019s Office. After the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office refused to take action, Stambaugh wrote letters to various\ngovernmental entities including the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Mayor\u2019s\nOffice, to which he received no response.\n             \u201c[A] person who is not adversely impacted by the matter he seeks to\nchallenge does not have standing to proceed with the court system\u2019s dispute\nresolution process.\u201d Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC v. Commonwealth, 888 A.2d\n655, 659 (Pa. 2005). \u201c[T]he requirement of standing arises from the principle that\njudicial intervention is appropriate only when the underlying controversy is real and\nconcrete,\u201d and \u201ca controversy is worthy of judicial review only if the individual\ninitiating the legal action has been \u2018aggrieved.\u2019\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\n             On November 15, 2022, almost three months after being served on the\npreliminary objections by the Mayor\u2019s Office, Petitioners submitted an amended\npetition for review alleging that Stambaugh is an aggrieved party and has a personal\ninterest in this matter.        Specifically, the amended petition alleges that Jones\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fcommitted criminal assault on Stambaugh by pointing a gun at him, but Respondents\nwrongfully prosecuted Stambaugh based on fabricated evidence. Pennsylvania Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 1516(b) provides that \u201c[e]very pleading filed after an\noriginal jurisdiction petition for review shall be filed within 30 days after service of\nthe preceding pleading[.]\u201d PA. R.A.P. 1516(b). Here, Petitioners filed the amended\npetition for review beyond the 30-day time frame without this Court\u2019s permission or\nconsent of Respondents; as such, we cannot consider Petitioners\u2019 amended petition\nas part of the pleadings.\n             Because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions, we sustain Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections\nand dismiss Stambaugh from this matter for his lack of standing to sue.\n                    II. Stambaugh\u2019s Authority to Bring Action\n             The District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections\nalso seek to dismiss the petition in its entirety because Stambaugh, who is not an\nattorney, signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. The petition does not\nallege that Stambaugh has a power of attorney to act on behalf of either Petitioner.\nA person who does not have authority to bring an action lacks the capacity to sue.\nIn re Estate of Sauers, 32 A.3d 1241, 1248-49 (Pa. 2011).\n             While Stambaugh signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis,\nthe record indicates that Walker and Davis each filed a letter on July 29, 2022, and\nAugust 4, 2022, in which they indicated their intention to represent themselves as\npro se and verified that all of the facts and information enclosed in the petition were\ntrue and correct to the best of their knowledge. Respondents did not object to the\nfiling of these two letters. Because Walker and Davis have indicated that they\nrepresent themselves in this matter, we overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthe County\u2019s preliminary objections challenging Stambaugh\u2019s authority to bring this\naction.\n                                  III. Immunity\n            Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections further assert that Petitioners are\nnot allowed to recover damages against them because such a claim is barred by\ngovernmental immunity and official immunity under Sections 8541 and 8545,\nrespectively, of the Tort Claims Act as well as quasi-judicial immunity.\n            However, the petition for review seeks mandamus relief, and \u201c[a]ctions\nin mandamus are not subject to the defense of sovereign immunity.\u201d Banfield v.\nCortes, 922 A.2d 36, 43 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2007) (citation omitted). This court has stated\nthat the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar suits that seek to compel an\nagency or officer to perform a ministerial or mandatory statutory duty. Id. (citing\nMilestone Materials, Inc. v. Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,\n730 A.2d 1034 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999), and City of Philadelphia v. Shapp, 403 A.2d\n1043 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1979)). Further, as a general matter, a successful plaintiff in a\nmandamus action is entitled to damages. Under Section 8303 of the Judicial Code,\na defendant in a mandamus action \u201cwho is adjudged . . . to have failed or refused\nwithout lawful justification to perform a duty required by law shall be liable in\ndamages to the person aggrieved by such failure or refusal.\u201d 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78303. See\nalso Maurice A. Nernberg & Associations v. Coyne, 920 A.2d 967, 970 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2007).\n            Accordingly, we overrule Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections\nasserting governmental immunity, official immunity, and quasi-judicial immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                        IV. Lack of Specificity on Damages\n\n             Finally, Respondents argue that allegations on damages should be\nstricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity. Petitioners did not plead\nfacts to identify what damages were sustained that were caused by the alleged\nmisconduct of any of the Respondents.\n\n             A party must plead the material facts on which a cause of action is\nbased. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(a). Averments of time, place, and items of special damage\nshall be stated specifically. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(f). Pennsylvania Rule of Civil\nProcedure 1028(c)(3) authorizes Respondents to object to the petition for review on\nthe basis that it was insufficiently specific. PA. R.CIV.P. 1028(c)(3). \u201cThe purpose\nof a preliminary objection raising specificity is to ensure that an adverse party\u2019s\nability to answer and defend will not be unduly impaired by a pleader\u2019s vagueness\nin stating the grounds of his suit.\u201d Stilp v. Commonwealth, 910 A.2d 775, 786 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2006). \u201cThus, the purpose is to require the pleader to disclose the material\nfacts sufficient to enable the adverse party to prepare his or her case.\u201d Id.\n\n             The petition alleges that Jones committed a series of criminal assaults\non Davis and Walker, and Respondents took no actions despite Davis and Walker\u2019s\nreports of these crimes. The petition asks that this Court compel Respondents to\nperform their official duties by initiating a criminal proceeding against Jones, and\ngrant damages and costs. Because the petition does not specify what damages or\ncosts Petitioners sustained from Respondents\u2019 alleged actions, we sustain\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenging the claim for damages and costs as\ninsufficiently specific and strike those claims from the petititon.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we sustain in part and overrule in part\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections to the petition for review. Specifically, we\nsustain the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objection\nchallenging Stambaugh\u2019s standing to sue and dismiss Stambaugh from this matter\nas a petitioner. We overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s\npreliminary objection challenging Stambaugh\u2019s authority to bring this action\nbecause Walker and Davis have indicated to this Court that they represent\nthemselves in this matter. We overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the\nCounty\u2019s preliminary objection raising immunity because Petitioners are seeking\nmandamus relief. We sustain the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s\npreliminary objection raising a lack of specificity in the pleading and strike the claim\nfor damages and costs from the petition for review.\n\n             Likewise, we sustain the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary objections as to\nStambaugh\u2019s standing to sue.        We sustain the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary\nobjection raising a specificity challenge to Petitioners\u2019 claim for damages and costs.\nWe overrule the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary objection asserting immunity.\n\n\n                            _________________________________________________________\n                            MARY HANNAH LEAVITT, President Judge Emerita\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f          IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nTresa Walker, LaTorya Davis           :\nand Travis Stambaugh,                 :\n                 Petitioners          :\n            v.                        :        No. 300 M.D. 2022\n                                      :\nMifflin County District Attorneys     :\nOffice; Mayors Office for Borough :\nof (Lewistown); Office of Attorney :\nGenerals; Mifflin County &            :\nPennsylvania State Officials in their :\nofficial capacities,                  :\n                     Respondents      :\n\n\n\n                                     ORDER\n\n             AND NOW, this 19th day of January, 2024, the preliminary objections\nraised by the Mifflin County District Attorney\u2019s Office, Mayor\u2019s Office for Borough\nof Lewistown, and Mifflin County are SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in\npart in accordance with the foregoing opinion.

AMW raises one\n\n      dispositive issue, which we restate as: whether the contempt order must be\n\n      reversed because the trial court abused its discretion when it issued an order\n\n      compelling AMW to respond to the Town of Clarksville\u2019s (\u201cTown\u201d) discovery\n\n      requests without considering objections raised in AMW\u2019s First Supplemental\n\n      Answers.\n\n\n[2]   We reverse and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n[3]   AMW owns real estate located at 4505 Highway 31 East, Clarksville, Indiana,\n\n      and it leases the property to Midwest Entertainment Ventures, Inc. (d\/b\/a\n\n      Theatre X) (\u201cMEV\u201d),1 an adult entertainment venue. AMW and MEV share\n\n      the same principal business address in Michigan.\n\n\n[4]   In May 2019, Town revoked Theatre X\u2019s adult business license due to zoning\n\n      ordinance violations. On May 6, 2019, MEV filed a Petition of Appeal of\n\n      Revocation of Adult Entertainment License in the Clark Circuit Court. Town\n\n      filed an Answer to the Petition, as well as counterclaims against MEV and\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          MEV is not a party to this appeal, as Town\u2019s contempt motion was filed against AMW only.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                            Page 2 of 20\n\f      AMW, seeking, in part, a preliminary injunction enjoining MEV and AMW\n\n      from operating Theatre X in violation of zoning ordinances. MEV and AMW\n\n      then filed motions to dismiss Town\u2019s counterclaims and motion for preliminary\n\n      injunction.\n\n\n[5]   In November 2019, the trial court denied the motions to dismiss and granted\n\n      Town\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction placed\n\n      specific operating restrictions upon Theatre X, including limiting its hours of\n\n      operation. On December 19, AMW and MEV filed an interlocutory appeal of\n\n      the preliminary injunction order.\n\n\n[6]   On December 17, 2019, Town filed a motion in which it sought an order\n\n      imposing fines for AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s ordinance violations. In February 2020,\n\n      AMW and MEV served discovery documents upon Town. On February 25,\n\n      the trial court issued an order on Town\u2019s motion for fines, stating, in relevant\n\n      part, \u201c[b]ecause the Court\u2019s Order of November 21, 2019, is currently on\n\n      appeal, the Court finds it is without authority to order the relief sought by the\n\n      Town.\u201d Town\u2019s App. v. II at 194. However, because it found \u201cthese issues\n\n      may arise again,\u201d the trial court made six pages of findings related to the Town\n\n      having \u201cSatisfied Its Notice Obligations\u201d and AMW being \u201cjointly responsible\n\n      with MEV for the maintenance of Theatre X.\u201d Id. at 194, 198.\n\n\n[7]   Town provided responses to AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s discovery requests. On May\n\n      28, 2020, Town propounded its own discovery requests upon AMW and MEV;\n\n      specifically, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 3 of 20\n\f      for admissions. Thereafter, AMW requested and obtained an extension of time\n\n      in which to respond to the discovery requests. On July 15, 2020, AMW\n\n      submitted its responses to discovery, and, for each and every discovery request,\n\n      replied only:\n\n\n              AMW objects on the basis that discovery is premature and\n              inappropriate during the pendency of appeal. AMW has\n              consistently challenged the propriety of \u2018counterclaims\u2019 in the\n              context of an administrative or municipal appeal. That issue is\n              currently on appeal in the context of AMW\u2019S appeal of the Order\n              Granting Preliminary Injunction on November 21, 2019. The\n              Court explicitly noted in its February 25, 2020[,] Order\n              Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it presently lacks\n              authority during the pendency of the Appeal. This discovery\n              request was issued after the divesture of jurisdiction and during\n              the period jurisdiction was divested by way of appeal. All further\n              and additional objections are reserved.\n\n\n      August 12, 2021, Appealed Order Granting Motion to Compel at 2-3.\n\n\n[8]   After complying with the Trial Rule 26(F) requirement to attempt informal\n\n      resolution of the discovery dispute and reaching no such resolution, on August\n\n      28, 2020, Town filed a Motion to Compel discovery responses. In that motion,\n\n      Town noted, \u201cNor did MEV or AMW raise any substantive objection other\n\n      than \u2018jurisdiction was divested\u2019 by their appeal, and that the \u2018discovery request\n\n      was issued after the divestiture of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, MEV and AMW have\n\n      waived any objection other than the jurisdictional one.\u201d AMW App. v. II at\n\n      81. On September 4, 2020, AMW filed its response in which it argued only that\n\n      the trial court had been \u201cdivested of jurisdiction,\u201d id. at 89, over the case\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 4 of 20\n\f       because AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal was pending, and that \u201cany discovery\u201d\n\n       regarding issues raised on appeal \u201cis foreclosed as this Court currently lacks\n\n       jurisdiction over those issues,\u201d id. at 91. In a docket entry on September 23, the\n\n       trial court stated: \u201cBecause this case is on appeal, the trial court will not rule on\n\n       matters until the appeal has been decided.\u201d Id. at 16 (CCS).\n\n\n[9]    In October 2020, a panel of this Court affirmed the preliminary injunction in\n\n       Town\u2019s favor, and in March 2021, the Supreme Court denied transfer. Midwest\n\n       Ent. Ventures, Inc. v. Town of Clarksville, 158 N.E.3d 787, 789 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n       2020), trans. denied. On April 29, Town filed a reply brief in support of its\n\n       Motion to Compel Discovery. The reply brief argued that (1) the interlocutory\n\n       appeal had not stayed discovery, and (2) AMW had \u201cwaived all other\n\n       objections to the discovery requests\u201d by failing to raise them in any of its\n\n       discovery responses. AMW App. v. II at 107. Town devoted a three-paragraph\n\n       section of its brief to the latter argument.\n\n\n[10]   On that same date, the trial court held a pretrial conference and scheduled a\n\n       June 21, 2021, hearing on the motion to compel discovery, which was\n\n       subsequently rescheduled to July 8, 2021. Prior to the July 2021 hearing,\n\n       AMW did not file any additional briefing or other documents in response to\n\n       Town\u2019s claims that AMW had waived all objections other than jurisdiction.\n\n       On June 18, 2021, AMW tendered to Town its First Supplemental Responses\n\n       to Discovery, in which it raised multiple objections, including objections related\n\n       to relevance, attorney-client privilege, vagueness, overbreadth, unduly\n\n       burdensome requests, harassment, accountant-client privilege, and attorney\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 5 of 20\n\f       work product doctrine. On July 8, 2021, Town filed a supplemental brief in\n\n       support of its motion to compel, arguing again that AMW had waived any\n\n       discovery objection other than the original objection related to the trial court\u2019s\n\n       alleged lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n[11]   On July 9, the trial court conducted a hearing on Town\u2019s Motion to Compel\n\n       Discovery. On August 12, 2021, the trial court issued its \u201cFindings and Order\n\n       Granting Respondent[\u2019]s Motion to Compel Discovery.\u201d August 12, 2021,\n\n       Appealed Order at 1. The court order found that MEV\u2019s and AMW\u2019s theory\n\n       that they were not required to respond to discovery because the trial court\n\n       lacked jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal was pending was without\n\n       merit. In so holding, the trial court cited Indiana Appellate Rule 14(H), which\n\n       states in relevant part, \u201cAn interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in\n\n       the trial court unless the trial court or a judge of the Court of Appeals so\n\n       orders.\u201d Id. The trial court noted:\n\n\n               No judge of the Court of Appeals ordered a stay of proceedings.\n               Neither did this Court. The Court did note in its Order\n               Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it lacked authority\n               to grant the Town\u2019s request for $770,000 in fines during the\n               appeal (Feb. 25, 2020, Fines Order at 2), but it never stated it\n               lacked jurisdiction over the case or that any proceedings\n               (including discovery) were stayed. In fact, this Court ruled on\n               several matters in that same February 25, 2020[,] Order as the\n               Court found \u201cthese issues may arise again.\u201d (Id.)\n\n\n       Id. at 5-6.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 6 of 20\n\f[12]   The trial court also found that AMW and MEV had waived any discovery\n\n       objections that they had \u201cfailed to raise in their original responses.\u201d Id. at 6-7.\n\n       In support, the trial court noted that the discovery rules require a party\n\n       responding to discovery to answer the requests or else state an objection and the\n\n       reasons for the objection. The court also cited Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d\n\n       3, 6 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), as support for its finding that \u201c[a] party that fails to\n\n       timely assert that information is privileged or otherwise undiscoverable in his\n\n       response waives reliance on those objections.\u201d Id. at 6. The trial court ordered\n\n       AMW and MEV to answer Town\u2019s discovery requests within thirty days and\n\n       \u201cwithhold nothing on the basis of any objection that they failed to raise in their\n\n       initial responses.\u201d Id. at 7.\n\n\n[13]   On September 13, 2021, AMW tendered to Town its second supplemental\n\n       discovery responses. On November 8, 2021, Town filed a motion to hold\n\n       AMW2 in contempt of the court\u2019s August order compelling discovery responses.\n\n       On that same date, AMW filed an Affidavit with its Initial, First Supplemental,\n\n       and Second Supplemental discovery responses attached thereto. On January\n\n       18, 2023, AMW filed its response to Town\u2019s motion for contempt, referencing\n\n       the November 8 affidavit and attached supplemental discovery responses.\n\n\n[14]   The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion for contempt on January 19,\n\n       2023. In its February 7, 2023, order holding AMW in contempt of the August\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The Town did not file a similar motion against MEV.\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024          Page 7 of 20\n\f       12, 2021, order compelling discovery responses, the trial court specifically noted\n\n       that AMW\u2019s first supplemental responses that were tendered on June 18, 2021,\n\n       were \u201cbelated.\u201d Appealed February 7, 2023, Order at 4. The court reiterated\n\n       that, in complying with the order compelling discovery responses, AMW was\n\n       \u201cnot permitted to raise any objections, or withhold any information, when\n\n       producing discovery.\u201d Id. at 5. The trial court found that AMW had\n\n       \u201ccontinued to object, and withhold documents, based on relevance and\n\n       privilege[] objections that the Discovery Order held were waived.\u201d Id. at 7.\n\n       The court found that those actions had violated the Discovery Order.\n\n\n[15]   The trial court imposed upon AMW a $30,000 civil sanction \u201cto coerce\n\n       AMW\u2019s compliance with the Discovery Order,\u201d but noted that \u201cAMW can\n\n       avoid this fine by complying with the Discovery Order\u2014by fully answering the\n\n       Town\u2019s discovery requests, providing the entirety of every responsive\n\n       document, and withholding (including by redaction) nothing therefrom\u2014within\n\n       30 days of this Order.\u201d Id. at 9. The court also found AMW liable for Town\u2019s\n\n       attorney fees and expenses incurred in addressing AMW\u2019s failure to comply\n\n       with the Discovery Order. This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n       Discussion and Decision\n       Standard of Review\n[16]   AMW appeals the trial court\u2019s order finding it in contempt of the order\n\n       compelling discovery responses and, in so doing, challenges the underlying\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 8 of 20\n\f       order compelling discovery responses.3 We review those orders for an abuse of\n\n       discretion.\n\n\n               Trial courts \u201cstand much closer than an appellate court to the\n               currents of litigation pending before them,\u201d so they are better\n               positioned to assess and manage discovery matters.

AMW admittedly raised no other objections in its initial\n\n       discovery response. However, on June 18, 2021, which was over two weeks\n\n       before the July 9 hearing on Town\u2019s motion to compel discovery, AMW\n\n       supplemented its discovery responses; in its First Supplemental Responses,\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         This Court has jurisdiction to review both the underlying order compelling discovery and the contempt\n       order. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Scroghan, 851 N.E.2d 317, 322 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006).\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                            Page 9 of 20\n\f       AMW raised additional discovery response objections, such as relevance and\n\n       attorney-client privilege. In its August 12, 2021, order compelling AMW to\n\n       respond to the discovery requests, the trial court found that AMW was not\n\n       permitted to rely upon any objection other than the one raised in its initial\u2014i.e.,\n\n       July 15, 2020\u2014discovery response. Thus, the trial court refused to consider any\n\n       of the objections AMW raised in its June 18 supplemental discovery response.\n\n       It is that decision which AMW now appeals.4\n\n\n[18]   Pursuant to Trial Rule 26(B)(1), a party \u201cmay obtain discovery regarding any\n\n       matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject-matter involved in the\n\n       pending action whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking\n\n       discovery or the claim or defense of any other party[.]\u201d The purpose of\n\n       Indiana\u2019s discovery rules is \u201cto allow a liberal discovery procedure\u201d for the\n\n       purposes of providing litigants \u201cwith information essential to the litigation of all\n\n       relevant issues, eliminat[ing] surprise[,] and \u2026 promot[ing] settlement.\u201d\n\n       Canfield v. Sandock, 563 N.E.2d 526, 528 (Ind. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         AMW argues, in addition, that its jurisdictional objection in its initial discovery response was correct;\n       however, we hold that objection was clearly incorrect, as no stay of the proceedings had been issued. See Ind.\n       Appellate Rule 14(H) (\u201cAn interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in the trial court unless the trial\n       court or a judge of the Court of Appeals so orders.\u201d); Battering v. State, 150 N.E.3d 597, 602 (Ind. 2020)\n       (emphasis original) (\u201cA plain reading of [Indiana Appellate Rule 14(H)] provides that an interlocutory appeal\n       only constitutes a stay if the trial court or the Court of Appeals so orders.\u201d).\n       AMW also argues on appeal that the Town waived its claim that AMW waived any objections not contained\n       in its original discovery response, e.g., relevance. AMW asserts that Town waived that claim by not\n       sufficiently raising it in the trial court. However, that assertion is incorrect, as Town clearly raised the waiver\n       argument in both its August 28, 2020, Motion to Compel and its April 29, 2021, Reply Brief in Support of\n       Motion to Compel. See AMW\u2019s App. at 81; Town\u2019s App. v. II at 234-238.

See Outback Steakhouse of Fla.,\n\n       Inc. v. Markley, 856 N.E.2d 65, 78 (Ind. 2006).\n\n\n[21]   Here, AMW\u2019s timely7 discovery responses in its July 15, 2020, initial response\n\n       addressed only the alleged lack of jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal\n\n       was pending and did not raise other objections. When the parties received the\n\n       new information that the appeal had ended, it became clear that the objections\n\n       based on jurisdiction, even if they had been correct when made (which they\n\n       were not), were moot. Therefore, AMW supplemented its discovery responses\n\n       with its additional responses, including new objections.8 See T.R. 26(E)(a), (b).\n\n       Trial Rule 26(E) allows such supplementation of discovery responses, and there\n\n       was no deadline imposed in this case, either by the court or agreement of the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         In fact, even responses that were \u201ccomplete when made\u201d must be supplemented if they become incorrect or\n       relate to witnesses and persons with discoverable knowledge. See T.R. 26(E)(1), (2).\n       7\n         AMW had obtained an extension of time to respond to discovery requests, up to and including July 15,\n       2020.\n       8\n         The concurrence would hold that the rule regarding supplementation of discovery is not even applicable to\n       AMW\u2019s June 18, 2021, supplemental answers because there was no \u201cnew information\u201d that would allow or\n       require supplementation. However, as we note above, the relevant new information in this case was the final\n       denial of AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal. That new information made it clear that AMW\u2019s initial discovery\n       responses based on the alleged \u201cdivestment\u201d of jurisdiction pending the interlocutory appeal was no longer\n       applicable and that supplemental responses were required. Thus, we analyze the timeliness of AMW\u2019s June\n       18, 2021, supplemental responses under Trial Rule 26 rather attempting to create a new balancing test for\n       \u201cuntimely\u201d responses under Rules 33, 34, and 37, as the concurrence suggests.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                           Page 12 of 20\n\f       parties, for supplementing discovery responses. See T.R. 16(A), (J) (regarding\n\n       pre-trial conferences and orders). Therefore, AMW\u2019s supplemental responses,\n\n       filed before the hearing and the decision on Town\u2019s motion to compel, were\n\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d and permissible.9 T.R. 26(E). The trial court abused its discretion\n\n       when it refused to consider AMW\u2019s supplemental discovery responses. And\n\n       AMW was prejudiced by that error; not only was it limited to objections that\n\n       had become moot, but it was required to provide full responses to discovery\n\n       without the court\u2019s consideration of any of its supplemental objections.\n\n\n[22]   Both the trial court and Town pointed to Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d 3, 6\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), as support for AMW\u2019s alleged waiver of any discovery\n\n       responses other than its original responses. However, this reliance is misplaced.\n\n       Marshall correctly held that any issue\u2014including discovery responses\u2014not\n\n       raised in the trial court until a motion to correct error or appeal is waived as\n\n       untimely. Id. at 8. However, that is not the situation in the case before us;\n\n       AMW raised its additional objections to the discovery requests before the July\n\n       2021 hearing and August 2021 order compelling discovery and well before the\n\n       February 2023 order finding it in contempt of the discovery order. Marshall is\n\n       inapposite.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         AMW waited approximately three months to file its supplemental discovery responses after it obtained the\n       \u201cnew information\u201d that its interlocutory appeal had failed. Some may opine that three months is not\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d per Rule 26(E), although we note that Town has not made that particular argument. However,\n       as the rule does not provide a time limit for what is \u201cseasonable,\u201d there was no discovery deadline in this\n       case, and the supplemental response was filed weeks before the hearing on the motion to compel, we\n       conclude that the supplemental responses were \u201cseasonably\u201d provided.

See\n\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) (interrogatory rule stating that \u201cany ground not stated\n\n       in a timely objection is waived\u201d);11 see also, e.g., Byrd v. Reno, No. Civ.A.96 2375,\n\n       1998 WL 429676, *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 1998) (\u201cA failure to file a timely\n\n       objection to interrogatories constitutes a waiver of any objection unless good\n\n       cause is shown.\u201d). However, this begs the question of what constitutes a\n\n       \u201ctimely\u201d objection. None of the cases\u2014either state or federal\u2014cited by Town\n\n       prohibit consideration of supplemental discovery responses provided prior to a\n\n       hearing and order on a motion to compel, when there was no deadline in place\n\n       for supplementing discovery responses.12\n\n\n\n                                                    Conclusion\n[24]   AWM\u2019s supplemental discovery responses, including objections, were timely\n\n       submitted, as they were provided before the hearing on Town\u2019s motion to\n\n       compel discovery responses and there was no deadline in this case that required\n\n       an earlier supplementation of discovery responses.

It appears to me that the majority reaches the\n\n       conclusion that AMW\u2019s objections, raised in its Supplemental Response, were\n\n       not waived because they were not untimely. First, I believe AMW\u2019s objections,\n\n       raised in its Supplemental Response, were late and untimely. However and\n\n       secondly, I believe that a late-raised objection does not necessarily result in a\n\n       waiver of that objection. Finally, I believe Marshall v. Woodruff provides the\n\n       outer boundaries for when a late objection can be deemed waived. Marshall\n\n       does not stand for the proposition that waiver of an objection only occurs when\n\n       a late-raised objection gets raised at the motion-to-correct-error stage. Here, we\n\n       need to determine when the late-raised objections can be found to be waived.\n\n\n[27]   To start, I believe that the timeliness and waiver of an objection to a discovery\n\n       request are separate questions requiring separate analyses. In other words, I do\n\n       not believe an untimely objection to a discovery request necessarily waives that\n\n       objection.\n\n\n[28]   In support of its untimeliness-equals-waiver argument, Town references the\n\n       Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Admittedly, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n       33 contains a blanket waiver provision. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) (\u201cAny\n\n       ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for good\n\n       cause, excuses the failure.\u201d) Federal case law has expanded that waiver\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 16 of 20\n\f       provision to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 34. See Boles v. Aramark Correctional\n\n       Svcs., LLC, 2018 WL 3854143 (6th Cir. 2018). However, the Indiana Trial Rules\n\n       do not include an equivalent\u2014or any\u2014waiver provision in Rules 33, 34, or 36.\n\n       The argument that we should look to the federal rules for guidance on whether\n\n       an untimely discovery objection is waived is not persuasive.\n\n\n[29]   Because our trial rules do not specify that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, and lacking any relevant guidance from the federal\n\n       counterpart to those rules, I disagree that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is necessarily waived. This determination of whether a late-submitted\n\n       objection is waived should be decided by the trial court based upon facts and\n\n       circumstances of the case as I will explain below.\n\n\n[30]   Secondly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that AMW\u2019s objection was\n\n       timely and with its reasoning that there was no deadline for making such an\n\n       objection. The majority opinion is based on Trial Rule 26(E), which allows for\n\n       supplementing a discovery response. However, Trial Rule 26(E) prescribes the\n\n       duty to supplement a prior response in the event of \u201cinformation thereafter\n\n       acquired.\u201d T.R. 26(E). There is no indication that the objections here arise\n\n       from or are based on information acquired after AMW filed its initial objection\n\n       on July 15, 2020. As a matter of fact, it appears that AMW knew all along that\n\n       its subsequently (and late-) raised objections could be asserted, they simply\n\n       chose not to do so. As a result, I do not believe Trial Rule 26(E) applies.\n\n       Instead, I believe the timeliness of an objection to a discovery request is more\n\n       appropriately governed by the trial rules, here, Trial Rule 33, 34, and 36.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024     Page 17 of 20\n\f[31]   Under our trial rules, the deadline for responding to a discovery request is set in\n\n       the rule regarding the type of discovery at issue. See Ind. Trial Rule 33(B)\n\n       (\u201cAnswers or objections to interrogatories shall include the interrogatory . . . to\n\n       which an objection is being made. . . . [R]easons for objections shall be stated in\n\n       lieu of an answer.\u201d); T.R. 33(C) (requiring responding party to serve \u201canswers\n\n       or objections within a period designated by the party submitting the\n\n       interrogatories, not less than thirty [30] days after service\u201d); T.R. 34(B)\n\n       (requiring written response to requests for production of documents, including\n\n       objections, within \u201ca period designated in the request, not less than thirty [30]\n\n       days after the service thereof\u201d); T.R. 36 (deeming admitted any request for\n\n       admission not answered or objected to \u201cwithin a period designated in the\n\n       request, not less than thirty [30] days after service thereof\u201d). The deadlines for\n\n       discovery responses, including objections, in those rules should be applied in\n\n       this case.\n\n\n[32]   Here, AMW served its amended objections after the 30-day deadline set in the\n\n       relevant trial rules, beyond any extension granted in a trial court order or\n\n       allowed by Town, and more than 30 days after the Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       denied transfer of the interlocutory appeal. As a result, I believe the objections\n\n       AMW asserted in its June 2021 first supplemental responses were not timely.\n\n\n[33]   Finally, although I would find AMW\u2019s new objections to be untimely, I do not\n\n       believe that AMW has waived those objections or that Marshall v. Woodruff\n\n       requires a contrary conclusion. Marshall responded to a motion to compel\n\n       discovery on the ground that the requested information was \u201cunavailable.\u201d\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 18 of 20\n\f       Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d 3, 6 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994). Ultimately, the trial\n\n       court dismissed Marshall\u2019s complaint for \u201cnon-compliance with discovery.\u201d Id.\n\n       at 5. Marshall then filed a motion to correct error, asserting for the first time an\n\n       objection to the discovery requested on the ground that it was privileged or\n\n       otherwise undiscoverable. Id. at 6. \u201cPrior to her motion to correct errors,\n\n       Marshall never contended the information was privileged or otherwise\n\n       undiscoverable as it related to the issue of damages. Marshall cannot now rely\n\n       on these untimely reasons for objection.\u201d Id. In support, the court cited T.R.\n\n       34(B) and Rodgers v. Rodgers, 503 N.E.2d 1255, 1257 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987),\n\n       which held that a party may not raise in a motion to correct error or on appeal\n\n       an issue not raised in the trial court. In sum, Marshall tells us that an untimely\n\n       objection is waived when it is asserted for the first time in a motion to correct\n\n       error or later.\n\n\n[34]   Here, as the majority explains, AMW\u2019s objections were raised prior to the\n\n       hearing on the Motion to Compel; in other words, much sooner than at the\n\n       motion-to-correct-error stage. This begs the question, when does a late-raised\n\n       objection become waived. I would suggest the following factors are relevant to\n\n       that inquiry. To determine whether an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, I believe courts should consider factors such as these:\n\n\n               1. the obstreperousness of the party;\n\n\n               2. the complexity (or lack thereof) of the issues;\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 19 of 20\n\f               3. the amount of time that passed between a motion to compel\n               and the hearing on that motion;\n\n\n               4. the amount of time, effort, and\/or expense the requesting\n               party put into trying to get the issue resolved (e.g., T.R. 26(F)\n               efforts); and\n\n\n               5. good cause.\n\n\n[35]   Applying such an analysis to this case, I believe that AMW\u2019s supplemental\n\n       responses (the late-raised objections) were late for the reasons explained above,\n\n       but I would hold that those objections are not waived given: (1) the rare and\n\n       unusual circumstances of this case, namely, the confusion created by the\n\n       interlocutory appeal as to whether the trial court retained authority over the\n\n       matter; (2) the lack of evidence that either party was being obstreperous; (3) the\n\n       lack of any real effort by Town to resolve the issue, given that Town only sent a\n\n       single letter to AMW pursuant to T.R. 26(F); (4) the fact that Town\u2019s Motion\n\n       to Compel was filed on August 28, 2020, and the hearing on that motion did\n\n       not occur until July 9, 2021; and (5) the fact that the amended\/supplemented\n\n       objections were filed prior to the hearing on the motion to compel.\n\n\n[36]   For these reasons, I concur and would also reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024         Page 20 of 20\n\f","                                                                                   FILED\n                                                                               Jan 19 2024, 8:53 am\n\n                                                                                   CLERK\n                                                                               Indiana Supreme Court\n                                                                                  Court of Appeals\n                                                                                    and Tax Court\n\n\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT                                    ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEES C.H.\nEDGEROCK DEVELOPMENT, LLC                                  GARMONG & SON, INC., AND\nMaggie L.

Garmong &\n\n      Son, Inc. (\u201cGarmong\u201d), Fox Contractors Corp. (\u201cFox\u201d), and Signworks\n\n      (\u201cSignworks\u201d) to complete the \u201cTrails of Westfield\u201d (the \u201cProject\u201d), a\n\n      commercial building project along State Road 32 in the City of Westfield (the\n\n      \u201cCity\u201d). The Project included work that was to be completed on five different\n\n      parcels of land, which were owned by three different entities. EdgeRock owned\n\n      two of the parcels, which were secured by a mortgage that had been executed in\n\n      favor of First Bank Richmond (\u201cFirst Bank\u201d). ZPS Westfield, LLC (\u201cZPS\u201d)\n\n      owned two of the parcels and contracted directly with EdgeRock for the work\n\n      that was to be completed on its land in connection with the Project and paid its\n\n      financial obligations outlined in its contract with EdgeRock in full.\n\n\n[2]   EdgeRock, however, failed to satisfy its financial obligations under its contracts\n\n      with Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, all three of which sought to encumber\n\n      certain parcels connected with the Project with mechanic\u2019s liens and filed\n\n      breach-of-contract actions against EdgeRock. After finding, inter alia, that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens filed in connection with the Project were valid and had priority\n\n      over a portion of First Bank\u2019s mortgage interest in EdgeRock\u2019s property, the\n\n      trial court entered judgment against EdgeRock and in rem judgments against\n\n      EdgeRock\u2019s and ZPS\u2019s property. The trial court also determined that\n\n      EdgeRock was entitled to recover certain road-impact fees (the \u201cRIF Funds\u201d)\n\n      that had been paid in connection to the Project by the City.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 3 of 56\n\f[3]   ZPS and EdgeRock challenge the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding the\n\n      validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens. ZPS also challenges the\n\n      inclusion of uninstalled material in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against its\n\n      property as well as the propriety of the prejudgment interest awarded to\n\n      Signworks. First Bank challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens had priority over part of its recorded mortgage interest.\n\n      EdgeRock challenges various summary judgment rulings made by the trial\n\n      court, and multiple parties challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that\n\n      EdgeRock is entitled to receive the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[4]   We conclude that (1) both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n      and EdgeRock\u2019s property are invalid; (2) the cost of uninstalled material should\n\n      not have been in included in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      and ZPS should not have been ordered to pay prejudgment interest to\n\n      Signworks; (3) to the extent that priority questions remain, First Bank\u2019s\n\n      mortgage interest, in its entirety, has priority; (4) the trial court did not err in\n\n      making the challenged summary judgment rulings; and (5) distribution of the\n\n      RIF Funds is stayed pending a ruling by the Hamilton Commercial Court in a\n\n      related matter regarding the priority of the secured interests in the funds and\n\n      any future ruling from this court regarding the RIF Funds should be consistent\n\n      with that of the Hamilton Commercial Court. We further conclude that the\n\n      trial court erred in denying First Bank\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees but that no\n\n      party is entitled to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, we note\n\n      that EdgeRock has not challenged the judgments against it relating to the\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024          Page 4 of 56\n\f      breach-of-contract claims brought by Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, and our\n\n      conclusions relating to the validity of the mechanic\u2019s liens do not alter those\n\n      judgments against EdgeRock in any way. Pursuant to our above-stated\n\n      conclusions, we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse\n\n      in part, and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n      I.      Initiation of the Project\n[5]   In 2015, EdgeRock and its investors purchased numerous separate parcels of\n\n      undeveloped land totaling seventeen acres along State Road 32 in the City. The\n\n      parcels were subsequently divided into Lots 1 through 5 as depicted below:\n\n\n\n\n      Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 5 p. 82. The five lots were then zoned as follows:\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 5 of 56\n\f            \u2022    Lot 1 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a\n                 Starbucks);\n            \u2022    Lot 2 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Penn\n                 Station and Forum Credit Union);\n            \u2022    Lot 3 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Crew\n                 Carwash);\n            \u2022    Lot 4 was zoned for multi-family apartments; and\n            \u2022    Lot 5 was zoned for retail business.\n\n      EdgeRock sold Lots 1 and 2 to ZPS in 2017, and, at some point, sold Lot 3 to\n\n      Dahm No. 49, LLC (\u201cDahm\u201d).1 EdgeRock maintained ownership of Lots 4\n\n      and 5.\n\n\n[6]   After purchasing Lots 1 and 2, ZPS contracted with EdgeRock to build two\n\n      structures and install related infrastructure on its property. ZPS\u2019s development\n\n      agreement for the construction and infrastructure on its property called for ZPS\n\n      to pay EdgeRock a total of $1,720,000.00. It is undisputed that ZPS paid the\n\n      entire amount it owed to EdgeRock, making its final payment in August of\n\n      2018.\n\n\n[7]   EdgeRock then contracted with Garmong to perform not only the work on\n\n      ZPS\u2019s property, but also work on the properties owned by EdgeRock and\n\n      Dahm. The total EdgeRock-Garmong contract amount was $3,253,390.00.\n\n      The EdgeRock-Garmong contract broke down the cost of Garmong\u2019s work into\n\n      two categories: \u201cLots 1 & 2\u201d totaling $1,172,114.00 and \u201cInfrastructure\u201d\n\n      totaling $1,730,284.00. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. The contract also\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Dahm was not a party to the underlying litigation and does not participate in this appeal.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 6 of 56\n\f      included $110,000.00 in contingency funds and an eight percent management\n\n      fee ($240,992.00) payable to Garmong. Garmong later submitted several\n\n      change orders, including Change Order 3 in the amount of $434,528.00, which\n\n      included work on Lot 3. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n      contract. Fox had a subcontract with Garmong, which included work on all\n\n      five lots.\n\n\n[8]   As part of the Project, the City contracted with EdgeRock to build 175th Street\n\n      (which would run to the north of Lots 4 and 5 and to the south of Lots 1, 2, and\n\n      3) and install related infrastructure (the \u201c175th-Street Project\u201d). The 175th-\n\n      Street Project was to be funded, at least in part, by RIF Funds issued by the\n\n      City. The 175th-Street Project included \u201c17.6 acres,\u201d with ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      making up 10.2% of the total acreage of the project and EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n      making up 58.6% of the total acreage. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 9 p. 36. The\n\n      remaining acreage came from Dahm\u2019s property. EdgeRock contracted directly\n\n      with Fox to complete the 175th-Street Project, which included building 175th\n\n      Street and installing related infrastructure. The EdgeRock-Fox contract was for\n\n      a total of $1,831,008.25. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Fox contract.\n\n      Its sole involvement was quitclaiming certain land needed to construct 175th\n\n      Street to the City.\n\n\n[9]   In September of 2018, EdgeRock contracted with Signworks to install two signs\n\n      on ZPS\u2019s property for a total price of $115,521.33. ZPS was not a party to the\n\n      EdgeRock-Signworks contract.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 7 of 56\n\f       II. Issues with Payment\/Garmong\u2019s First Mechanic\u2019s\n           Lien\n[10]   As the Project moved forward, EdgeRock\u2019s payments to Garmong became\n\n       somewhat sporadic. EdgeRock paid invoices that had been submitted by\n\n       Garmong on December 11, 2017, April 17, 2018, and June 1, 2018. EdgeRock\n\n       did not pay invoices that were submitted by Garmong on March 7, 2018, June\n\n       20, 2018, July 30, 2018, August 24, 2018, September 25, 2018, and October 30,\n\n       2018. On December 4, 2018, following five months of nonpayment from\n\n       EdgeRock, Garmong filed a notice of intention to hold a mechanic\u2019s lien, and\n\n       recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $2,140,722.51. The lien was\n\n       recorded on December 5, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Garmong Lien\u201d).\n\n\n       III. First Bank Mortgage\n[11]   During late 2018 or early 2019, EdgeRock sought financing from First Bank \u201cto\n\n       refinance the existing mortgages\u201d on the planned development \u201cand pay for the\n\n       construction work\u201d that had thus far been completed. Ultimately, EdgeRock\n\n       received a $4,900,000.00 commercial loan from First Bank \u201cto reimburse for\n\n       land development expense[s] and payoff existing mortgages on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d\n\n       Ex. Vol. 19 p. 125. In return, First Bank received a mortgage interest on Lots 4\n\n       and 5 (the \u201cFirst Bank Mortgage\u201d); an assignment of EdgeRock\u2019s interests in an\n\n       agreement with Citizens Wastewater of Westfield, LLC; a secured interest in\n\n       the RIF Funds; and guaranty from EdgeRock\u2019s executives, Austin Dalton and\n\n       R. Birch Dalton. First Bank\u2019s loan documents included: (1) a UCC financing\n\n       statement signed by EdgeRock, granting the Bank a security interest in the RIF\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 8 of 56\n\f       Funds; (2) a Security Agreement executed by EdgeRock, granting First Bank a\n\n       security interest in the RIF Funds; and (3) a UCC financing statement filed with\n\n       the Indiana Secretary of State, covering collateral including the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[12]   The First Bank Mortgage was duly recorded on February 25, 2019. It is\n\n       undisputed that proceeds from the loan were distributed as follows:\n\n\n                 Amount                 Purpose\n                 $2,140,722.51          Payment to secure release of the 2018 Garmong\n                                        Lien\n                 $250,000.00            Payment of Blocked Interest Account Funds (used\n                                        for payment of loan interest)\n                 $45,431.00             Payment of loan origination fee\n                 $3500.00               Payment of appraisal fee\n                 $1000.00               Payment of appraisal review fee\n                 $46.00                 Payment of fee for flood determination\n                 $23.00                 Payment of wire and UCC filing fees\n                 $9269.00               Payment of various title company charges\n                 $165.00                Payment of recording charges\n                 $2,028,443.62          Payment to Acquisition Lenders to secure release\n                                        of the Acquisition Mortgage\n                 $15,000.00             Payment of EdgeRock\u2019s legal fees\n                 $5000.00               Payment of insurance premium\n                 $401,399.87            Payment to EdgeRock\n\n\n       The amounts tendered to the Acquisition Lenders equaled the amounts\n\n       remaining due under their respective acquisition promissory notes and served to\n\n       secure release of the Acquisition Mortgage. Following Garmong\u2019s receipt of\n\n       the $2,140,722.51, the 2018 Garmong Lien was released.\n\n\n[13]   A condition of the First Bank Mortgage had been that First Bank would\n\n       \u201creceive a first priority mortgage on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d Tr.

First\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 9 of 56\n\f       Bank had not been made aware prior to the closing of the First Bank Mortgage\n\n       that Garmong \u201chad an outstanding claim for work performed of over $1 million\n\n       in addition to the Garmong mechanic\u2019s lien of $2.1 million that was being paid\n\n       off at the closing.\u201d Tr. Vol. 6 p. 117.\n\n\n       IV. Continued Issues with Payment\n[14]   Garmong submitted an invoice to EdgeRock on November 19, 2018, in the\n\n       amount of $299,155.84. This invoice had not been included in the 2018\n\n       Garmong Lien because the due date for payment had not passed as of the date\n\n       that the lien had been recorded. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice. Garmong\n\n       submitted another invoice to EdgeRock in the amount of $643,886.80 on\n\n       January 23, 2019. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice.\n\n\n[15]   According to the terms of its subcontract with Garmong, Fox was to receive\n\n       $1,315,000.00. According to the terms of its direct contract with EdgeRock,\n\n       Fox was to receive $1,831,008.25. Fox was not paid in full for its work done\n\n       under either contract.\n\n\n[16]   Signworks submitted invoices to EdgeRock on November 29, 2018, January 28,\n\n       2019, and April 17, 2019. EdgeRock, however, did not make any payments to\n\n       Signworks outside of its initial $3000.00 deposit.\n\n\n       V.      The Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n[17]   On June 24, 2019, Signworks recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 1 in the\n\n       amount of $48,992.29 and a separate mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 2 in the\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 10 of 56\n\f       amount of $59,039.04. On August 30, 2019, Fox recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\u2014\n\n       each in the sum of $1,213,228.23\u2014against ZPS\u2019s Lots 1 and 2 and EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       Lots 4 and 5. On September 4, 2019, Garmong recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against Lots 4 and 5 in the amount of $1,009,055.62. The next day, Garmong\n\n       recorded mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1 and 2 in the same amount. On\n\n       September 10, 2019, Fox recorded additional mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1, 2,\n\n       4, and 5, each in the amount of $500,053.43. Litigation under cause number\n\n       29D05-1912-PL-11500 (\u201cCause No. PL-11500\u201d) soon followed.\n\n\n       VI. Lien Foreclosure Proceedings\n[18]   On December 9, 2019, Garmong filed suit under Cause No. PL-11500 against\n\n       EdgeRock, ZPS, First Bank, Fox, and Signworks, seeking to foreclose its\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and\n\n       damages. On March 4, 2020, Fox filed cross-claims against EdgeRock and\n\n       ZPS, seeking to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract,\n\n       unjust enrichment, and violation of personal liability notice. On March 10,\n\n       2020, Fox filed a third-party complaint against the City in which it indicated\n\n       that it had named the City \u201cas a party to assert any interest it may have in the\n\n       Edge[R]ock Property and\/or ZPS property.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 3 pp.\n\n       152, 153. On May 29, 2020, Garmong requested leave to amend its complaint\n\n       to dismiss its claims against Signworks and to add Signworks as a plaintiff to its\n\n       complaint. The trial court granted Garmong\u2019s motion and Garmong filed an\n\n       amended complaint listing Signworks as a plaintiff rather than a defendant.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 11 of 56\n\f       Counterclaims were subsequently filed against Garmong by EdgeRock and\n\n       Fox. The trial court scheduled trial starting on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n       VII. The RIF Funds\n[19]   On February 19, 2021, the City filed a motion for interpleader, in which it\n\n       sought \u201can order requiring the deposit of funds with the Court, declaring that\n\n       [the City] has satisfied its obligation under the [RIF] Credit Agreement, and\n\n       that its property is not encumbered by any parties to this matter, and ordering\n\n       its dismissal with prejudice.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 12. The City\n\n       claimed that it \u201cis in no position to determine how much should be disbursed to\n\n       each party that completed work on 175th.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 15.\n\n       Fox responded claiming that it \u201cis the only party in this lawsuit which\n\n       performed any work and supplied any materials for the construction of 175th\n\n       Street and the relocation of the Anna Kendall Drain [(the \u201cDrain\u201d)]. Fox is\n\n       entitled to all of the funds that will be interpleaded by [the City].\u201d Appellants\u2019\n\n       Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 28. First Bank also claimed to be entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n       While ZPS did not assert a formal claim for the RIF Funds in Cause No. PL-\n\n       11500, it asserted a priority interest in the RIF Funds in a separately filed\n\n       lawsuit in the Hamilton Commercial Court, under cause number 29D02-2107-\n\n       PL-5088 (\u201cCause No. PL-5088\u201d). This lawsuit, which was filed on July 20,\n\n       2021, remains pending.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The proceedings in the commercial court action were stayed by order of the court on June 21, 2022.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                            Page 12 of 56\n\f       VIII.            Competing Motions for Partial Summary\n                        Judgment\n[20]   On May 7, 2020, EdgeRock filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On\n\n       December 7, 2020, ZPS filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Ten days\n\n       later, the trial court issued an order holding all motions for summary judgment\n\n       in abeyance until trial began on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n[21]   On January 28, 2021, following the first two days of trial, the trial court issued\n\n       an order informing the parties that it would \u201cconsider summary judgment\n\n       motions prior to the next hearing date on April 9, 2021.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 16 p. 77. The trial court further ordered that\n\n\n               The parties are given until February 12, 2021[,] to file any new or\n               amended motions for summary judgment. The parties shall be\n               given until March 15, 2021[,] to file any responses to summary\n               judgment motions. A hearing will be set for the Court to hear\n               arguments on all summary judgment motions on March 24,\n               2021[.]\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 77. Signworks, Fox, and Garmong moved for\n\n       partial summary judgment on February 12, 2021. Also on February 12, 2021,\n\n       ZPS and EdgeRock filed amended motions for partial summary judgment.\n\n\n       IX. The Trial Court\u2019s Orders\n[22]   On April 7, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Garmong\u2019s motion for\n\n       partial summary judgment and denying EdgeRock\u2019s motion for partial\n\n       summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that Garmong\u2019s\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 13 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid and that summary\n\n       judgment relating to Change Order 3 was improper because a material dispute\n\n       remained as to whether Change Order 3 had been approved by EdgeRock. The\n\n       trial court further found that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the\n\n       Drain were never part of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract; the consequential\n\n       damages waiver barred EdgeRock\u2019s claim for rent abatement, loss of future\n\n       business, and tortious interference with banking relationships; EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       tortious interference claims are barred by the waiver; and rent abatement paid\n\n       to ZPS is barred by the waiver.\n\n\n[23]   On April 28, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying\n\n       in part ZPS\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial\n\n       court found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on the unjust\n\n       enrichment claims brought by Garmong and Signworks. The trial court found\n\n       that summary judgment relating to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens filed against ZPS\u2019s property was improper because issues of\n\n       material fact remained as to whether the liens were valid, specifically whether\n\n       the liens were overstated. In denying summary judgment on the question of\n\n       whether the mechanic\u2019s liens were valid, the trial court found, as a matter of\n\n       law, that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien had been timely filed. The trial court further\n\n       found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on Garmong\u2019s, Signworks\u2019s,\n\n       and Fox\u2019s requests for attorney\u2019s fees, stating that it is undisputed that ZPS had\n\n       paid EdgeRock \u201call that it was obligated to pay under the terms of the\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 14 of 56\n\f       Development Agreement,\u201d and, as a result, \u201cGarmong, Signworks, and Fox\n\n       may not recover attorney\u2019s fees\u201d from ZPS. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 83.\n\n\n[24]   On May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying in\n\n       part Fox\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court\n\n       found, as a matter of law, that Fox\u2019s liens on EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid,\n\n       but found that issues of material fact existed as to the validity of Fox\u2019s liens on\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[25]   Also on May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Signworks\u2019s\n\n       motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that\n\n       Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s property were \u201cvalid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 100.\n\n\n[26]   Trial continued on all remaining issues. After the conclusion of trial, on May\n\n       25, 2022, the trial court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\n\n       judgment. With respect to Garmong\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the\n\n       trial court concluded as follows: (1) EdgeRock had breached its contract with\n\n       Garmong; (2) Garmong was entitled to foreclose its liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property; (3) Garmong\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property were valid and were not\n\n       overstated; (4) Garmong had not breached its contract with EdgeRock; (5) there\n\n       was no basis for EdgeRock\u2019s slander-of-title or fraud claims; and (6) there was\n\n       no basis for ZPS\u2019s slander-of-title claims.\n\n\n[27]   With respect to Fox\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the trial court\n\n       concluded that EdgeRock had breached its contract with Fox. The trial court\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 15 of 56\n\f       further concluded that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against both EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n       and ZPS\u2019s property were valid and that Fox was entitled to foreclose its liens.\n\n\n[28]   With respect to Signworks\u2019s claims, the trial court concluded that EdgeRock\n\n       had breached its contract with Signworks. As a result of the breach, Signworks\n\n       was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from EdgeRock.\n\n\n[29]   With respect to questions relating to lien priority, the trial court concluded as\n\n       follows: (1) First Bank only had priority for the first $2,140,722.51 of its loan to\n\n       EdgeRock; (2) mechanic\u2019s liens take priority from the date the contractor begins\n\n       work; (3) equitable subrogation is not compatible with the Indiana Mechanic\u2019s\n\n       Lien Statute (the \u201cIMLS\u201d) and does not apply; (4) even if equitable subrogation\n\n       could apply, the equities favor Garmong and Fox; (5) First Bank\u2019s equitable\n\n       estoppel argument fails; (6) the \u201cspecific project\u201d language of Indiana Code\n\n       section 32-28-3-5(d) did not encompass First Bank\u2019s entire loan; and (7) First\n\n       Bank was entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[30]   Based on these conclusions, the trial court ordered the following:\n\n\n               1.     Judgment is entered in favor of Garmong and against\n               [EdgeRock] on Count 3 of Garmong\u2019s Amended Complaint in\n               the amount of $943,042.64, plus interest on the balance at the\n               rate of at 12% per year accruing from February 23, 2019 (the due\n               date of the final invoice).

Stated differently, a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien \u201cprevents landowners from enjoying their improved property\n\n       while those who provided the labor and materials get the shaft.\u201d U.S. Steel, 182\n\n       N.E.3d at 842.\n\n\n[33]   Indiana has long had a statutory right to a mechanic\u2019s lien.

Code \u00a7 32-28-3-2(a). Generally,\n\n\n               a person who wishes to acquire a lien upon property, whether the\n               claim is due or not, must file in duplicate a sworn statement and\n               notice of the person\u2019s intention to hold a lien upon the property\n               for the amount of the claim:\n                      (1) in the recorder\u2019s office of the county; and\n                      (2) not later than ninety (90) days after performing\n                      labor or furnishing materials or machinery[.]\n\n\n       Ind.

Applicable Standards of Review\n       A.      Summary Judgment\n[37]   When reviewing a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying summary judgment,\n\n       \u201cour standard of review is the same as that of the trial court.\u201d Webb v. City of\n\n       Carmel, 101 N.E.3d 850, 860 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018).\n\n\n               We stand in the shoes of the trial court and apply a de novo\n               standard of review. Our review of a summary judgment motion\n               is limited to those materials designated to the trial court.\n               Summary judgment is appropriate only where the designated\n               evidence shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and\n               the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For\n               summary judgment purposes, a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it bears on\n               the ultimate resolution of relevant issues. We view the pleadings\n               and designated materials in the light most favorable to the non-\n               moving party. Additionally, all facts and reasonable inferences\n               from those facts are construed in favor of the non-moving party.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 22 of 56\n\f       Id. (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe initial burden is on the summary-\n\n       judgment movant to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of fact as to\n\n       a determinative issue, at which point the burden shifts to the non-movant to\n\n       come forward with contrary evidence showing an issue for the trier of fact.\u201d\n\n       Hughley v. State, 15 N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014) (cleaned up).\n\n\n       B.      Findings & Conclusions\n[38]   In cases where the trial court enters findings of fact and conclusions thereon,\n\n       our standard of review is two-tiered:\n\n\n               [W]e first determine whether the evidence supports the trial\n               court\u2019s findings and second, we determine whether the findings\n               support the judgment. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous\n               when the record lacks any reasonable inference from the\n               evidence to support them and the trial court\u2019s judgment is clearly\n               erroneous if it is unsupported by the findings and the conclusions\n               which rely upon those findings. In determining whether the\n               findings on the judgment are clearly erroneous, we consider only\n               the evidence favorable to the judgment and all reasonable\n               inferences to be drawn therefrom.\n\n               In conducting our review, we cannot reweigh the evidence or\n               judge the credibility of any witnesses, and must affirm the trial\n               court\u2019s decision if the record contains any supporting evidence or\n               inferences. However, while we defer substantially to findings of\n               fact, we do not do so to conclusions of law. We evaluate\n               questions of law de novo and owe no deference to a trial court\u2019s\n               determination of such questions.\n\n\n       Roberts v. Feitz, 933 N.E.2d 466, 475\u201376 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citations\n\n       omitted, emphasis in original).\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 23 of 56\n\f       C.      Motion to Correct Error\n[39]   We review an order granting or denying a motion to correct error for abuse of\n\n       discretion. In re Paternity of V.A., 10 N.E.3d 65, 67 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014). \u201cAn\n\n       abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court\u2019s decision is against the logic and\n\n       effect of the facts and circumstances before the court, or the reasonable\n\n       inferences [drawn] therefrom.\u201d Id.\n\n\n       III. Analysis\n       A.      Validity\/Scope of Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n[40]   Both ZPS and EdgeRock challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that\n\n       Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens were valid. In addition, ZPS contends\n\n       that the trial court erred by allowing Signworks to include costs for materials\n\n       that were never installed on its property in their mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property.\n\n\n[41]   1.      Breadth and Scope of Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n\n[42]   In 1896, the Indiana Supreme Court held that\n\n\n               [w]here labor is performed or materials furnished under one\n               contract upon several buildings, all situate[d] upon one lot of land\n               belonging to the contracting owner, the lien attaches to all the land\n               for the whole value of the labor performed, and it is immaterial\n               whether the contract specifies one sum for all work or separate\n               amounts for each building.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024            Page 24 of 56\n\f       Premier Steel Co. v. McElwaine-Richards Co., 144 Ind. 614, 619, 43 N.E. 876, 877\u2013\n\n       78 (1896) (emphasis added, internal quotation omitted). The Supreme Court\n\n       went on to say, however, that \u201c[i]f the work be done or materials are furnished\n\n       upon distinct premises, the lien must be against each of the several premises, according\n\n       to the value of the work and materials incorporated in each, and not against both for\n\n       the aggregate amount.\u201d Id. at 620, 43 N.E. at 878 (emphasis added). More\n\n       recently, we have stated that\n\n\n               unless, a joint lien is appropriate because work was done on, or\n               materials were supplied for, more than one structure on a single\n               tract of land, pursuant to one contract, a lien may not be had on\n               one structure for work done on or materials furnished for a\n               different structure.\n\n\n       Cato v. David Excavating Co., 435 N.E.2d 597, 605 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982), overruled\n\n       on other grounds by Johnson v. Blankenship, 688 N.E.2d 1250 (Ind. 1997) (internal\n\n       citations omitted).\n\n\n[43]   The question before us is, when work is completed on multiple parcels of land,\n\n       whether a mechanic\u2019s lien can encompass all costs associated with the project\n\n       as a whole or must be restricted in some fashion as it relates to the encumbered\n\n       parcel. Indiana Code section 32-28-3-1(b)(2) states that\n\n\n               A person \u2026 may have a lien separately or jointly \u2026 on the\n               interest of the owner of the lot or parcel of land:\n                      (A) on which the structure or improvement stands; or\n                      (B) with which the structure or improvement is\n                      connected;\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 25 of 56\n\f               to the extent of the value of any labor done or the material\n               furnished, or both, including any use of the leased equipment and\n               tools.\n\n\n       (Emphasis added). The parties dispute the meaning of the term \u201cconnected\u201d\n\n       with Garmong and Fox requesting that we define the term \u201cconnected\u201d broadly\n\n       and ZPS and EdgeRock requesting that we apply a narrower definition of the\n\n       term, i.e., a definition that would require common ownership of the land in\n\n       question.\n\n\n[44]   In support of its request for a broad interpretation of the term \u201cconnected,\u201d\n\n       Garmong points to this court\u2019s decision in West v. Dreher, 73 Ind. App. 133, 136,\n\n       126 N.E. 688, 689 (1920), in which we concluded that a mechanic\u2019s lien applied\n\n       equally to homes built on two adjoining parcels under one contract because\n\n       \u201cthe two houses, within the mechanic\u2019s-lien law of this State, are one piece of\n\n       work.\u201d However, our decision in West does not support an interpretation as\n\n       broad as that requested by Garmong because in West, the two parcels were\n\n       owned by the same individual, 73 Ind. App. at 134, 126 N.E. at 688, and we\n\n       cannot say that our conclusion would have been the same if the lots had been\n\n       owned by different individuals. Garmong also points to our decision in\n\n       Windfall Natural Gas, Mining & Oil Co. v. Roe, 42 Ind. App. 278, 85 N.E. 722\n\n       (1908), overruled on other grounds by Cline v. Indianapolis Mortar & Fuel Co., 65 Ind.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 26 of 56\n\f       App. 383, 117 N.E. 509 (1917), another case involving common ownership.3\n\n       For its part, Fox cites to our decision in Inter-City Contractors Services, Inc. v.\n\n       Consumer Building Industries, Inc., 175 Ind. App. 665, 373 N.E.2d 903 (1978), for\n\n       the proposition that a mechanic\u2019s lien could be asserted against numerous lots\n\n       for collective work completed under a single contract. However, Inter-City also\n\n       does not support the broad interpretation of the term \u201cconnected\u201d favored by\n\n       Fox and Garmong as it dealt with a single parcel owned by a single entity that\n\n       was subsequently divided into numerous lots. Id. at 667\u201368, 373 N.E.2d at\n\n       905.4\n\n\n[45]   For their part, ZPS and EdgeRock assert that the cases cited by Garmong and\n\n       Fox actually support their position, i.e., that applicable Indiana authority\n\n       applies a narrower interpretation of the term \u201cconnected\u201d as it requires\n\n       common ownership. Based on our reading of the relevant Indiana authority,\n\n       we must agree. See, e.g., Windfall, 42 Ind. App. at 280, 85 N.E. at 723\n\n       (providing that a joint lien may be had upon work completed under a single\n\n       contract when the parcels are connected in construction and ownership). This\n\n       interpretation is consistent with our decision in O.J. Shoemaker, Inc. v. Board of\n\n       Trustees of General Retirement System of City of Detroit, 479 N.E.2d 1349, 1351\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         While Garmong does not cite to any Indiana authority that would support the broad interpretation it is\n       requesting, it does cite Deegan v. Kilpatrick, 66 N.Y.S. 628 (1900) and Caird Engineering Works v. Seven-Up Gold\n       Mining Co., 111 P.2d 267 (Mont. 1940). However, to the extent that Deegan and Caird can be read as\n       supporting Garmong\u2019s position, we are not bound by either case.\n       4\n         Fox also cites to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Phillips v. Gilbert, 101 U.S. 721 (1879), but\n       that case also appears to involve common ownership of all of the land at issue.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                               Page 27 of 56\n\f       (Ind. Ct. App. 1985), in which we acknowledged that \u201ca lien may not be had on\n\n       one structure for work done on or materials furnished for a different\n\n       structure[.]\u201d5 We interpret relevant Indiana authority as requiring common\n\n       ownership before a mechanic\u2019s lien can be levied against a parcel for work that\n\n       has been completed on numerous parcels. Applying this interpretation to the\n\n       facts of this case, we turn our attention to the question of whether the trial court\n\n       erred in determining that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property and EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n       i.       Arguments Relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s Liens on ZPS\u2019s Property\n\n[46]   ZPS argues that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s finding that ZPS must pay, as part of a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien, for work performed on property ZPS does not own is\n\n       unprecedented and inconsistent with Indiana law.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p.\n\n       29. ZPS succinctly states, \u201cIndiana law doesn\u2019t allow a contractor to lien one\n\n       property for work performed on another without common ownership.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Reply Br. p. 12. ZPS points out that despite having been given the opportunity\n\n       to do so, neither Fox nor Garmong was able to prove the value of the work\n\n       actually performed on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In support of this interpretation, ZPS additionally cites to New England Savings Bank v. Meadow Lakes Realty\n       Co., 688 A.2d 345, 348\u201349 (Conn. App. Ct. 1997), in which the Appellate Court of Connecticut held that a\n       mechanic\u2019s lien filed against a property could not include amounts relating to work done on a different parcel\n       that did not enjoy common ownership. While this case could be considered instructive in so far as its holding\n       seems to be consistent with relevant Indiana authority, like the out-of-state cases cited by Garmong, it is not\n       binding precedent.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 28 of 56\n\f       a.      Garmong\u2019s Lien\n\n[47]   ZPS claims that the evidence established that the amount of Garmong\u2019s lien\n\n       includes amounts for work performed on its property, EdgeRock\u2019s property,\n\n       and Dahm\u2019s property. Garmong\u2019s Regional Manager, Mitch Hannum, who\n\n       had been involved with calculating the amount of the lien, testified at trial as\n\n       follows:\n\n\n               Q:     And so the amount of the lien that Garmong recorded on\n               [ZPS\u2019s] property is exactly the same as the amount of the lien it\n               recorded on EdgeRock\u2019s property. Is that correct?\n               A:     Yes.\n               Q:     The two liens cover the same scope of work, right?\n               A:     Yeah, it was one project.\n               Q:     And they both include work that took place on Lots 1, 2,\n               3, 4, and 5, correct?\n               A:     That is correct.\n               Q:     So [ZPS] owns Lots 1 and 2, but the lien that Garmong\n               recorded on this property includes work that was done on Lots 3,\n               4, and 5.\n               A:     Yes.\n               ****\n               Q:     So at the time that Garmong executed the ZPS lien, it\n               knew that the amount it was claiming included work performed\n               on Lots 3, 4, and 5. Is that correct?\n               A:     We recorded liens for the entire project. So, yes, we knew\n               when we filed liens that work was done on all of the five parcels because\n               we performed work on all of the five parcels.\n               Q:     And the amount that you were claiming in ZPS\u2019s lien, you\n               knew at the time you executed the lien that it included amounts\n               that Garmong claimed it was owed for work on Lots 3, 4, and 5.\n               A:     Yes, I believe I just - I believe that\u2019s what I just said, yes.\n               Yes.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024           Page 29 of 56\n\f       Tr. Vol. III pp. 14\u201315 (emphases added). In addition, Michael Preyss,\n\n       Garmong\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, testified that he did not know \u201chow much\n\n       of this $1,009,055.62 that is set forth in the mechanic\u2019s lien on [ZPS\u2019s] property\n\n       relates to work performed on\u201d ZPS\u2019s property. Tr. Vol. III p. 224. Preyss\n\n       further admitted that he could not \u201csit here telling you that X dollars went to\n\n       this particular parcel of land and Y dollars went to this other particular parcel of\n\n       land.\u201d Tr. Vol. III p. 223.\n\n\n[48]   ZPS claims that Hannum\u2019s and Preyss\u2019s testimony \u201cunequivocally established\n\n       that the Garmong lien on ZPS\u2019s Property included work on property that ZPS\n\n       did not own.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 42. Further, although Garmong asserts\n\n       otherwise, review of the invoices referenced by Garmong\u2019s counsel indicates\n\n       that the invoices do not appear to have included only work that benefited ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property. In sum, ZPS argues that \u201cGarmong\u2019s executives were right:\n\n       Garmong\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s Property includes amounts for work performed on\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s Property and Dahm\u2019s Property. This is fatal to Garmon\u2019s lien\n\n       claim against ZPS\u2019s Property and the trial court\u2019s Judgment enforcing\n\n       Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s Property should be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. pp. 44\u201345. We must agree with ZPS. Based on the evidence\n\n       presented to the trial court, we conclude that Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was\n\n       overstated such that it included costs associated with work that had not been\n\n       completed on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[49]   In Abbey Villas Development Corp. v. Site Contractors, Inc., 716 N.E.2d 91, 100\u201301\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 1999), we noted that where a claimant has intentionally or\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 30 of 56\n\f       through culpable negligence overstated the amount due to him, such\n\n       overstatement will render his lien void, but mere mistake will not necessarily\n\n       render the whole lien void when it is clear that no fraud was intended and the\n\n       claimant had not misled the defendant to his prejudice. Garmong asserts that\n\n       to the extent that its mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s property was overstated,\n\n       such overstatement was not intentional or the result of culpable negligence. We\n\n       conclude, however, that the evidence demonstrates otherwise. Hannum\u2019s and\n\n       Preyss\u2019s testimony unequivocally established that the Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien included work on property that ZPS did not own, and that Garmong had\n\n       known as much when it had filed its lien. As such, we conclude that\n\n       Garmong\u2019s knowing overstatement rendered its mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property void.6 See Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301.\n\n\n       b.      Fox\u2019s Liens\n\n[50]   ZPS claims that the majority of Fox\u2019s work on the 175th-Street Project did \u201cnot\n\n       even touch Lots 1 and 2\u201d and \u201cit is undisputed that Fox\u2019s lien includes amounts\n\n       for work performed on property not owned by ZPS.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p.\n\n       32. ZPS points to the trial testimony of Fox employee Don Adamson, who\n\n       testified that he did \u201cnot know the value of the work that Fox performed on\n\n       Lots 1 and 2 related to the 175th Street project\u201d and that none of the line items\n\n       charged in relation to the street construction related exclusively to work\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        Because we conclude that Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s property is void, it follows that the\n       award of prejudgment interest that was awarded in conjunction with and as part of the lien is extinguished.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                            Page 31 of 56\n\f       completed on Lots 1 and 2. Tr. Vol. IV p. 241. Adamson admitted that he had\n\n       \u201cno idea how to put a value on\u201d the work Fox completed as it relates to ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property and that he \u201cwould have no way to know what the value of the work\n\n       is.\u201d Tr. Vol. IV pp. 242, 243. Given the lack of evidence relating to the value\n\n       of Fox\u2019s work on the 175th-Street Project on Lots 1 and 2, ZPS claims that Fox\n\n       knowingly overstated its mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[51]   The trial court appeared to acknowledge that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens may have\n\n       been overstated as it related to ZPS, finding that \u201ceven if they were [overstated],\n\n       they were not intentionally or negligently overstated.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 2 p. 156. ZPS asserts that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that the\n\n       overstatement was not intentional or negligent, given the evidence\n\n       demonstrating that Fox had known when it had asserted the lien that the lien\n\n       had included costs associated with work that was not done on ZPS\u2019s property,\n\n       its overstatement was intentional. ZPS also asserts that the prejudice in this\n\n       regard was self-evident. We agree with ZPS on both assertions.\n\n\n[52]   ZPS claims that Fox failed to prove that its mechanic\u2019s liens represented the\n\n       value of its work on ZPS\u2019s property, noting that it did not bear the burden of\n\n       disproving the value but rather that Fox had the burden to prove the value of its\n\n       work. ZPS points to the fact that a large portion of Fox\u2019s work was completed\n\n       on Lot 3, which ZPS asserts provided no value to its property. ZPS also claims\n\n       that it did not benefit from the installation of the water and sewer work as it\n\n       already had access to water and does not tie into the new sewer line, which\n\n       allows Lot 4 access to the sewer system. Thus, ZPS claims that \u201c[t]his water\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 32 of 56\n\f       line and sewer lateral work provided no benefit whatsoever, directly or\n\n       indirectly, to ZPS\u2019s property\u2014yet because Fox included it in its lien against\n\n       ZPS\u2019s Property, the trial court\u2019s judgment forces ZPS to pay for it.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 36.\n\n\n[53]   In arguing that it would be inequitable for it to bear the complete cost of the\n\n       175th-Street Project, ZPS points to the fact that its property constitutes only\n\n       10.2% of the property adjoining 175th Street. Fox seems to merely assert that\n\n       its work was common-infrastructure work that benefitted all five lots, including\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property. Again, Adamson testified that he had \u201cno way to know the\n\n       value of the work\u201d on ZPS\u2019s property but acknowledged that the work on 175th\n\n       Street had benefited property owned by EdgeRock and Dahm. Tr. Vol. IV p.\n\n       243. In sum, ZPS asserts that \u201cFox\u2019s inclusion of amounts in its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       liens that did not benefit ZPS, or for work which was not performed on ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Property and benefited multiple property owners, means it intentionally or\n\n       negligently overstated its liens and thus they are void.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 25.\n\n\n[54]   Similar to our conclusion relating to Garmong, we conclude that the evidence\n\n       demonstrates that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien included work on property that ZPS\n\n       did not own, and that Fox had known as much when it had filed the lien. As\n\n       such, we conclude that Fox\u2019s knowing overstatement rendered its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien against ZPS\u2019s property void. See Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 33 of 56\n\f       ii.     Arguments Relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s Liens on EdgeRock\u2019s Property\n\n[55]   At the summary-judgment stage, EdgeRock, Garmong, and Fox sought\n\n       determinations as to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against EdgeRock\u2019s property. On April 7, 2021, the trial court determined that\n\n       \u201cGarmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on Edge[R]ock\u2019s property is valid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 71. On May 13, 2021, the trial court\n\n       likewise determined that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens, which related to both its direct\n\n       contract with EdgeRock and the Garmong subcontract, were valid as a matter\n\n       of law. In finding both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens to be valid as a\n\n       matter of law, the trial court determined that the liens had been timely filed and\n\n       that neither Garmong nor Fox had overstated the amount of its lien. Following\n\n       trial, the trial court reaffirmed its earlier determination that Garmong\u2019s and\n\n       Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n[56]   EdgeRock argues that both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s liens should have been found\n\n       invalid as a matter of law because neither Garmong nor Fox limited their liens\n\n       to costs associated with work completed on EdgeRock\u2019s property but included\n\n       costs associated with work done on property owned by ZPS and Dahm.\n\n       EdgeRock asserts that as a result of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s failure to separate out\n\n       the costs associated with work done on each individual property owner\u2019s\n\n       property,\n\n\n               [t]here are now effectively $4.8 million dollars\u2019 worth of liens on\n               lots owned by different people\/entities when it is undisputed that\n               the cumulative amount owed is only $1.2 million. And on top of\n               that, the lien on Lot 3 has been removed altogether so that the\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 34 of 56\n\f               only lot benefiting from the work done on Lot 3 is not even in the\n               mix anymore. It is inequitable to allow Fox to pursue only ZPS\n               and EdgeRock without deducting the real, tangible value\n               provided by their work to Lot 3.\n\n\n       EdgeRock\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 55.\n\n\n[57]   Garmong claims that EdgeRock\u2019s status as the developer for the Project\n\n       subjected it to liability for the entire contract amount. Garmong asserts that if\n\n       EdgeRock \u201cis allowed to avoid the liens, the result is anything but equitable\u201d\n\n       and EdgeRock \u201cshould not be permitted to subdivide Garmong\u2019s lien rights for\n\n       the project to avoid paying Garmong.\u201d Garmong\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 43. Fox\n\n       also claims that it would be inequitable for EdgeRock \u201cto receive the benefit\n\n       and value of Fox\u2019s infrastructure work without having Edge[R]ock pay for it.\u201d\n\n       Fox\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 55. While both Garmong and Fox could clearly have\n\n       received, and in fact did receive, money judgments against EdgeRock for the\n\n       unpaid amount due under the parties\u2019 contracts, it does not necessarily follow\n\n       that Garmong and Fox could assert mechanic\u2019s liens for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property against EdgeRock\u2019s property.\n\n\n[58]   The parties have not cited to any Indiana authority creating an exception to the\n\n       common-ownership requirement that would extend EdgeRock\u2019s liability such\n\n       that its property can be encumbered by money owed for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property by virtue of its status as the Project developer. We conclude\n\n       that the rationale for our conclusions relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 35 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property apply equally to the liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property. We further conclude, therefore, that the liens were overstated.\n\n\n[59]   The evidence set forth in the preceding section establishes that both Garmong\n\n       and Fox had known at the time they recorded their mechanic\u2019s liens that the\n\n       lien amounts included work that had been completed on all five parcels. Thus,\n\n       Garmong and Fox overstated their lien amounts when they recorded their\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property. Like their liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property, their knowing overstatement has rendered their liens void. See Abbey\n\n       Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301. This conclusion, however, has no effect on the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination that EdgeRock had breached its contracts with both\n\n       Garmong and Fox or the resulting breach-of-contract judgments entered against\n\n       EdgeRock.\n\n\n       iii.    Signworks\u2019s Lien\n\n       a.      Inclusion of Costs Relating to Non-Installed Materials\n[60]   ZPS also contends that the trial court erred in allowing Signworks to include\n\n       the cost of materials purchased\u2014but not installed on ZPS\u2019s property\u2014 in its\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens. ZPS cites to our opinion in Cho v. Purdue Research Foundation,\n\n       803 N.E.2d 1161, 1172 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), for the proposition that a\n\n       contractor \u201ccannot maintain a mechanic\u2019s lien for the value of the materials and\n\n       equipment purchased but not installed or delivered.\u201d See also Stanray Corp. v.\n\n       Horizon Const., Inc., 168 Ind. App. 164, 177, 342 N.E.2d 645, 653 (1976)\n\n       (providing that a lien can only include materials furnished to a property owner,\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 36 of 56\n\f       which means that the materials have both been ordered and delivered to the\n\n       property owner). ZPS reiterates that because \u201cthe whole point of the\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien remedy\u201d is to prevent unjust enrichment to an owner\u2019s\n\n       property, [Signworks] should not be able to recover the costs of the challenged\n\n       materials which \u201cdid not improve ZPS\u2019s Property.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 32.\n\n\n[61]   ZPS claims that Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien for $93,268.37 included\n\n\n               $27,500[.00] for what Signworks described as \u201cmaterials\n               presently stored.\u201d It is undisputed that Signworks did not\n               perform all of the work called for in the contract as, among other\n               things, it has yet to install cabinets and toppers. These materials\n               are still being stored in Signworks\u2019[s] warehouse, where they\n               remain crated and packed.\n\n\n       ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 50 (internal record citations omitted). ZPS asserts that\n\n       \u201c[p]er Cho, \u2026 the value of these cabinets and toppers should not have been\n\n       included in the Judgment; the principal amount of the judgment in favor of\n\n       Signworks should be reduced by $27,500[.00].\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 50.\n\n\n[62]   Signworks argues that it can recover for the materials in question, which it\n\n       asserts were custom-fabricated for the Project. In support, Signworks cites to\n\n       our opinion in Jackson v. J.A. Franklin & Son, 107 Ind. App. 38, 41\u201342, 23\n\n       N.E.2d 23, 25 (1939), in which we concluded that \u201c[i]t is not always necessary\n\n       to show that the material went into the building. Circumstances in a given case\n\n       may be such that the owner of the building is estopped from invoking the\n\n       general rule.\u201d (Emphasis in original as published in the Indiana Appellate\n\n       Court Reports). Signworks further cites to our decision in Foster Lumber Co. v.\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 37 of 56\n\f       Sigma Chi Chapter House of De Pauw Univ., 49 Ind. App. 528, 532, 97 N.E. 801,\n\n       802 (1912), in which we concluded that \u201c[t]he materialman is properly said to\n\n       have \u2018furnished\u2019 the materials when he had delivered or has them ready for\n\n       delivery at the place where he has agreed to deliver them under the contract.\u201d\n\n       (Internal quotation omitted). Signworks asserts that the only reason the\n\n       materials were not installed was because EdgeRock had breached their contract.\n\n       Thus, under the circumstances of this case, Signworks argues that it should be\n\n       able to recover for the uninstalled materials.\n\n\n[63]   We find our decisions in Cho and Stanray to be instructive on this question. In\n\n       these cases, we concluded that materials are \u201cfurnished\u201d when \u201cordered for and\n\n       delivered.\u201d Stanray, 168 Ind. App. at 177, 342 N.E.2d at 653 (emphasis added).\n\n       As such, we conclude that Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was overstated to the\n\n       extent that it included the $27,500.00 value of the uninstalled materials.\n\n       However, unlike the Garmong and Fox liens, we do not conclude that the\n\n       overstatement was made in a knowing or negligent fashion as there was a good-\n\n       faith dispute as to whether the costs could be included. As such, we conclude\n\n       that Signworks\u2019s overstatement did not render its mechanic\u2019s lien void. See\n\n       Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301 (providing that mere mistake in\n\n       overstatement will not necessarily render a mechanic\u2019s lien void when it was\n\n       clear that there was no fraud intended). On remand, we therefore instruct the\n\n       trial court to reduce Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien to eliminate the cost of the\n\n       uninstalled materials.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 38 of 56\n\f       b.      Inclusion of Prejudgment Interest\n[64]   ZPS also contends that the trial court erred in including an award of\n\n       prejudgment interest in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.\n\n\n               When reviewing a decision regarding an award of prejudgment\n               interest, our standard of review is for an abuse of discretion,\n               focusing on the trial court\u2019s threshold determination as to\n               whether the facts satisfy the test for making such an award.\n               Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. v. S.E. Lab Group, Inc., 644 N.E.2d\n               615, 617 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), trans. denied. The decision to\n               award prejudgment interest rests on a factual determination and\n               this court may only consider the evidence most favorable to the\n               judgment. Id.\n\n               We note that the crucial factor in determining whether damages\n               in the form of prejudgment interest are allowable is whether the\n               damages were ascertainable in accordance with fixed rules of\n               evidence and accepted standards of valuation. Id. at 618. An\n               award of prejudgment interest is proper only where a simple\n               mathematical computation is required. Brane v. Roth, 590 N.E.2d\n               587, 593 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992), trans. denied. Damages that are the\n               subject of a good faith dispute cannot allow for an award of prejudgment\n               interest. Id.\n\n\n       Bopp v. Brames, 713 N.E.2d 866, 872 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (emphasis added),\n\n       trans. denied.\n\n\n[65]   While the amount owed to Signworks under its contract with EdgeRock was\n\n       not in dispute, as it related to ZPS, ZPS and Signworks were engaged in a good-\n\n       faith dispute regarding the amount of damages that should be included in\n\n       Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien both below and on appeal. Again, \u201cdamages that\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024          Page 39 of 56\n\f       are the subject of a good faith dispute cannot allow for an award of\n\n       prejudgment interest.\u201d Id. As such, we conclude that the trial court abused its\n\n       discretion in including an award of prejudgment interest in Signworks\u2019s\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s property. See Clark v. Hunter, 861 N.E.2d 1202, 1208\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 2007) (providing that damages that are the subject of a good-faith\n\n       dispute cannot allow for an award of prejudgment interest nor is an award\n\n       proper when the trial court must exercise its judgment to assess the amount of\n\n       damages).7 On remand, we instruct the trial court to remove the award of\n\n       prejudgment interest from Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.\n\n\n       B.       Priority Questions\n[66]   Given our conclusion that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against\n\n       EdgeRock\u2019s property are invalid, there is no longer any question as to whether\n\n       the liens have priority over any portion of the First Bank Mortgage because the\n\n       liens no longer exist. Moreover, it is clear under Indiana law that the First\n\n       Bank Mortgage has priority over the subsequently-entered judgments entered\n\n       against EdgeRock in connection with Garmong\u2019s, Fox\u2019s, and Signworks\u2019s\n\n       breach-of-contract claims. See Huntingburg Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Griese, 456\n\n       N.E.2d 448, 452 (Ind. Ct. App. 1983) (\u201cA judgment lien is subordinate to all\n\n       prior conveyances and mortgages and all existing loans and equities in favor of\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         While the trial court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest as it relates to ZPS, we again\n       note that no similar good-faith dispute as to damages exists as it relates to Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract\n       action against EdgeRock. As such, the award of prejudgment interest that was awarded in relation to\n       Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract action against EdgeRock stands.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                              Page 40 of 56\n\f       third persons.\u201d). On remand, we therefore instruct the trial court to grant the\n\n       First Bank Mortgage priority over all remaining encumbrances on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property that are at issue in this case.\n\n\n       C.      Challenged Summary Judgment Rulings\n[67]   EdgeRock has challenged two of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings,\n\n       which, if found erroneous, could potentially affect the amount of Garmong\u2019s\n\n       breach-of-contract judgment against it.\n\n\n       1.      Change Order 3\n\n[68]   EdgeRock asserted below that it had not approved Change Order 3 and sought\n\n       summary judgment on the issue. In requesting summary judgment, EdgeRock\n\n       had claimed that \u201cGarmong could not recover amounts incurred pursuant to\n\n       Change Order #3 because EdgeRock never approved this Change Order in\n\n       writing as unambiguously required under the contract\u201d and had designated\n\n       supporting evidence. EdgeRock\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 63. For its part, Garmong\n\n       designated evidence indicating that EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 and had paid seventy-five percent of the amount due for Change Order\n\n       3 without complaint.\n\n\n[69]   The trial court denied EdgeRock\u2019s request for summary judgment, finding that\n\n       issues of fact precluded summary judgment. Specifically, the trial court found\n\n       that\n\n\n               Damian Etchison and Mitch Hannum both testified that\n               Edge[R]ock orally approved Change Order 3. This testimony\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 41 of 56\n\f         contradicts [EdgeRock\u2019s manager Birch] Dalton\u2019s testimony and\n         creates an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.\n         Edge[R]ock provided Garmong with the revised civil drawings\n         that were prepared by Edge[R]ock\u2019s own civil engineer and\n         asked Garmong to carry out the work depicted on those revised\n         civil drawings. If Garmong had not carried out Change Order 3,\n         construction on the Project could not have begun. All site\n         activity would have stopped after demolition.\n\n         Edge[R]ock also paid for seventy-five percent of Change Order 3.\n         When negotiating the $2.1 million payment for the release of the\n         November 2018 mechanic\u2019s lien, Edge[R]ock did not assert that\n         Change Order 3 was not approved. Edge[R]ock also claims in its\n         brief that the $2.1 million payment was a final payment, so\n         Edge[R]ock believes it has paid for the Change Order 3 work in\n         full.\n\n         Edge[R]ock paying for the Change Order 3 work gives rise to the\n         inference that Edge[R]ock approved Change Order 3. The Court\n         must construe all inferences that can be drawn from the\n         designated evidence in Garmong\u2019s favor. Hughley v. State, 15\n         N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014). A reasonable factfinder could\n         conclude from Edge[R]ock\u2019s payment of Change Order 3 that\n         Edge[R]ock approved the Change Order. Thus, there is an issue\n         of fact for trial.\n\n\nAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 66\u201367 (emphasis in original, internal record\n\ncitation omitted).8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Following trial, the trial court found that Change Order 3 was valid. EdgeRock does not appear to\nspecifically challenge the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions relating to Change Order 3 in its final order,\ninstead focusing its argument on its belief that it had been entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                                Page 42 of 56\n\f[70]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence created an issue of\n\n       material fact as to whether EdgeRock had approved Change Order 3. The\n\n       designated evidence established that EdgeRock had orally approved other\n\n       change orders and had paid for seventy-five percent of the charges related to\n\n       Change Order 3 without objection. Witness statements also provided\n\n       conflicting evidence as to whether EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 before the included work commenced. The Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       has recognized that a contract providing that any modification must be in\n\n       writing may nevertheless be modified orally. See AM General LLC v. Armour, 46\n\n       N.E.3d 436, 443 n.3 (Ind. 2015) (citing Sees v. Bank One, Ind., N.A., 839 N.E.2d\n\n       154, 161 (Ind. 2005)). Upon reviewing the parties\u2019 designated evidence, the\n\n       trial court determined that issues of material fact existed. Like the trial court,\n\n       we conclude that the designated evidence created an issue of material fact. As\n\n       such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to Change\n\n       Order 3.\n\n\n       2.      Scope-of-Work Question\n\n[71]   EdgeRock and Garmong filed competing motions for summary judgment on\n\n       the question of whether the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain\n\n       were included in the scope of work covered by the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n       contract. EdgeRock claimed below that this work was included in the parties\u2019\n\n       contract and, because Garmong did not complete this work and EdgeRock was\n\n       forced to contract with Fox to complete the work, EdgeRock was entitled to\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 43 of 56\n\f       credit for costs associated with this work that had been paid to Garmong. The\n\n       trial court found, as a matter of law, that\n\n\n               [t]he scope of work listed in the contract did not include the\n               [175th-Street Project] or the drain relocation. These items were\n               thus not removed from Garmong\u2019s scope of work as they were\n               never part of Garmong\u2019s scope of work to begin with.\n               Edge[R]ock is not entitled to a contractual credit for the [175th-\n               Street Project] or the drain relocation.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 64\u201365. EdgeRock argues on appeal that the trial\n\n       court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Garmong on this issue.\n\n\n[72]   The designated evidence demonstrated that the EdgeRock-Garmong contract\n\n       provided that the contract sum was guaranteed \u201cnot to exceed\u201d $3,255,390.00.\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 225. The scope of work included in the contract\n\n       was detailed in Exhibit B of the contract. Exhibit B outlined both the work that\n\n       was to be completed by Garmong and the budget for said work. The budget\n\n       breakdown provided as follows:\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 44 of 56\n\fAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. As the budget breakdown indicates,\n\n$1,300,277.00 was budgeted for work that was to be completed on Lots 1 and 2\n\nand $1,953,113.00 was budgeted for infrastructure work. EdgeRock asserts that\n\nthe infrastructure work included all work that was needed to complete the\n\n175th-Street Project and to relocate the Drain. While the budget sheet does\n\ninclude costs in the infrastructure portion for \u201cAsphalt Paving,\u201d which, in\n\ntheory, could have been part of the funds necessary to construct 175th Street,\n\nthe budget breakdown does not appear to include any costs that would appear\n\nto apply to drain relocation as \u201c$0\u201d was allocated to plumbing. Appellants\u2019 Jt.\n\nApp. Vol. 2 p. 240.\n\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 45 of 56\n\f[73]   In finding that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain were not\n\n       included in the scope of work of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract, the trial\n\n       court noted that adopting EdgeRock\u2019s interpretation of the included scope of\n\n       work would require it to violate the principles of contract interpretation and to\n\n       rewrite the parties\u2019 contract. Specifically, the trial court determined that\n\n\n               Adopting Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading would require the Court to strike\n               out the eight pages of the Guaranteed Maximum Price\n               Amendment listing the scope of work. That portion of the\n               Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment would serve no\n               purpose if the true scope of work was all the work depicted in the\n               drawings.\n\n               Garmong\u2019s reading of the contract by contrast harmonizes the\n               whole contract without eliminating any part of it. The only\n               reading that makes the document into a cohesive whole is that\n               the drawing log lists the source material for the narrower eight-\n               page scope of work to be undertaken by Garmong. Garmong\u2019s\n               reading is also consistent with the drawings themselves, which\n               depict a phased project. Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading of the contract\n               would eliminate the phased aspect of the Project as Garmong\n               would be carrying out all phases at once.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 64.\n\n\n[74]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence establishes as a\n\n       matter of law that the 175th-Street and Drain projects were not included in the\n\n       scope of work set forth in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract. In claiming that\n\n       these projects were included, or that a question of material fact existed as to\n\n       whether they were, EdgeRock points to the following pictures which it claims\n\n       prove that drain-relocation work was \u201cfoundational work that had to be\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 46 of 56\n\fcompleted at the beginning of the Project\u201d and thus must have been included in\n\nthe EdgeRock-Garmong contract:\n\n\n\n\nEdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 22 (noting that the original pictures could be found at\n\nEx. Vol. 19 pp. 4, 7 but that it had added the arrows and boxes). EdgeRock\n\nargues that these pictures, when considered together with the budget line item\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 47 of 56\n\f       including $1,179,997.00 for earth moving, with a separate amount included for\n\n       earth moving on Lots 1 and 2, \u201cprovide the plans for moving the stream and\n\n       drain as part of the base contract.\u201d EdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 23. We disagree.\n\n       Rather, we conclude that the pictures relied on by EdgeRock fall short both of\n\n       proving or creating an issue of material fact as to whether that drain-relocation\n\n       work was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract as they merely depict\n\n       where the original drain was and to where it was subsequently relocated but do\n\n       not address whether the cost was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract.\n\n       Because the designated evidence falls short of either proving EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       proffered interpretation or creating an issue of material fact on the question, we\n\n       further conclude that the award of summary judgment in favor of Garmong on\n\n       the scope-of-work question was appropriate.\n\n\n       D.      RIF Funds\n[75]   Noting First Bank\u2019s secured interest in the RIF Funds, the trial court initially\n\n       awarded the RIF Funds to First Bank. In doing so, the trial court rejected Fox\u2019s\n\n       claim to the RIF Funds. In its order on the parties\u2019 motions to correct error, the\n\n       trial court acknowledged that ZPS had filed suit against EdgeRock in Cause\n\n       No. PL-5088 and that that action was pending. The trial court amended its\n\n       prior order to award the RIF Funds to EdgeRock. EdgeRock claims that the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination is correct because pursuant to its contract with the\n\n       City, it is entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[76]   First Bank contends that the trial court\u2019s original order was correct with respect\n\n       to the RIF Funds because it holds a first-priority secured interest in the RIF\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 48 of 56\n\f       Funds. First Bank argues that the RIF Agreement was a contract between the\n\n       City and EdgeRock and that Fox has no claims to the RIF Funds under the\n\n       contract and that Fox\u2019s claim on the RIF Funds is not supported by law. First\n\n       Bank likewise argues that ZPS has no claim to the RIF Funds as it has failed to\n\n       offer any evidence in the instant case which supports ZPS\u2019s assertion that it has a\n\n       secured interest in the funds. Furthermore, to the extent that Fox and others\n\n       assert that First Bank is not entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not\n\n       asserted a judicial claim against the funds, First Bank argues that it was not\n\n       required to do so.\n\n\n[77]   Fox contends that it is entitled to the RIF Funds. In support of its claim, Fox\n\n       notes that it brought the City into the litigation and asserts that it was the only\n\n       party to incur any costs associated with or do any of the work on the 175th-\n\n       Street Project. Fox asserts that the use of impact fees, such as the RIF Funds,\n\n       are controlled by Indiana Code section 36-7-4-1300 et seq., which indicates that\n\n       such funds are to be used to mitigate costs directly in connection with projects\n\n       for the construction of infrastructure, such as roads, public ways, bridges,\n\n       drains, and drainage. See Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-7-4-1305, -1309. Fox claims that\n\n       because it built the 175th-Street Project but was never paid for its work, it is\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds. Fox argues that while other entities have claimed to\n\n       have a right to the RIF Funds, it was the only party to assert a formal claim for\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 49 of 56\n\f       the funds in the instant lawsuit.9 Fox also argues that EdgeRock was not\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not incurred any costs associated with\n\n       the 175th-Street Project. EdgeRock contests this argument, claiming that due to\n\n       the allegedly substandard quality of Fox\u2019s work, it had to hire another\n\n       contractor to finish the job. Fox does not have a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds.\n\n\n[78]   For its part, ZPS contends that it has a secured interest in the RIF Funds. It\n\n       asserts, however, that \u201c[g]iven the multiple interests in the RIF Funds, many of\n\n       which were not represented or addressed in this action, and given that\n\n       Edge[R]ock did not even assert a claim to the RIF Funds, the trial court\u2019s\n\n       award was erroneous and must be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 57. ZPS\n\n       asserts that as of May 24, 2021, EdgeRock owed ZPS $441,879.52 and that in\n\n       relation to this debt, ZPS had secured its interest in the RIF Funds. ZPS argues\n\n       that \u201c[e]ntitlement to the RIF Funds should be determined by the Hamilton\n\n       County Commercial Court, where all entitles with a secured interest in\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s assets are parties.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 49. Thus, ZPS claims that\n\n       we should \u201creverse the award of RIF Funds to Edge[R]ock and remand with\n\n       instructions to the Hamilton County Clerk to continue holding the RIF Funds\n\n       pending resolution of\u201d Cause No. PL-5088. ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 54.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n        Fox classifies First Bank\u2019s claimed interest in the RIF Funds as being a private debt obligation that was\n       unrelated to the construction of 175th Street.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 50 of 56\n\f[79]   Given that at least one party, i.e., First Bank, has a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding the RIF Funds to\n\n       EdgeRock. However, given the allegedly competing secured interests in the\n\n       funds, not all of which are represented in this action but all of which are\n\n       represented in Cause No. PL-5088, we instruct the trial court to stay\n\n       distribution of the funds in this case pending a determination of priority of the\n\n       competing secured interests by the Hamilton Commercial Court. Moreover,\n\n       any future rulings by the trial court regarding the RIF Funds should be\n\n       consistent with the priority determination made by the Hamilton Commercial\n\n       Court in Cause No. PL-5088.\n\n\n       E.      Attorney\u2019s Fees\n       1.      First Bank\u2019s Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n[80]   \u201cIndiana adheres to the American rule that in general, a party must pay his own\n\n       attorneys\u2019 fees absent an agreement between the parties, a statute, or other rule\n\n       to the contrary.\u201d R.L. Turner Corp. v. Town of Brownsburg, 963 N.E.2d 453, 458\n\n       (Ind. 2012). \u201c[A] contract allowing for recovery of attorney[\u2019s] fees is\n\n       enforceable, if the contract is not contrary to law or public policy.\u201d Holliday v.\n\n       Crooked Creek Vills. Homeowners Assoc., Inc., 759 N.E.2d 1088, 1095 (Ind. Ct.\n\n       App. 2001). \u201cA trial court\u2019s decision to award or deny attorney fees is in the\n\n       exercise of a sound discretion, and in the absence of an affirmative showing of\n\n       error or abuse of discretion we must affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\u201d C.H. v. A.R.,\n\n       72 N.E.3d 996, 1003 (Ind. Ct. App. 2017) (cleaned up). Likewise, \u201cthe amount\n\n       recoverable for an award of attorney fees is left to the sound discretion of the\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 51 of 56\n\f       trial court.\u201d Holliday, 759 N.E.2d at 1095. \u201cThe trial court abuses its discretion\n\n       if its decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and\n\n       circumstances before it.\u201d Id. In addition, the amount of the trial court\u2019s award\n\n       of attorney\u2019s fees must be supported by the evidence. Id.\n\n\n[81]   First Bank requested that EdgeRock be ordered to pay its attorney\u2019s fees on\n\n       June 9, 2022. In its petition, First Bank asserted that pursuant to the terms of\n\n       the parties\u2019 mortgage and loan agreement, it is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees\n\n       from EdgeRock following a default. First Bank alleged that EdgeRock had\n\n       defaulted on the loan agreement \u201cas a result of, among other things,: a. after an\n\n       extension of the maturing date, the loan matured on November 19, 2020; and b.\n\n       the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens by Garmong and Fox, and the failure of\n\n       [EdgeRock] to pay those mechanic\u2019s liens and claims.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 18 p. 193. First Bank asserts on appeal that its petition \u201cfully complied\n\n       with Indiana\u2019s standards for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d and was supported by\n\n       affidavits which included \u201cmeticulous breakdowns of the time spent working on\n\n       Cause No. 29D05-1912-PL-011500 as well as the associated rates charged.\u201d\n\n       First Bank\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. pp. 48\u201349. The trial court denied First Bank\u2019s\n\n       request for attorney\u2019s fees, without explanation, in an order dated July 20, 2022.\n\n\n[82]   On appeal, First Bank argues that the trial court erred in denying its request for\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees. EdgeRock does not appear to challenge First Bank\u2019s request for\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees. However, Garmong and Fox challenge First Bank\u2019s request for\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees, claiming that \u201cobtaining a judicial finding of default is a\n\n       precondition to obtaining a fee award\u201d and First Bank \u201cdid not ask the trial\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 52 of 56\n\f       court to find that [EdgeRock] defaulted on the note, and the trial court, thus,\n\n       did not make such a finding.\u201d Appellees Garmong & Fox\u2019s Jt. Br. p. 45.\n\n\n[83]   With respect to attorney\u2019s fees, the First Bank Mortgage documents provide, in\n\n       relevant part, as follows:\n\n\n               18. COLLECTION EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES.\n               On or after the occurrence of an Event of Default, to the extent\n               permitted by law, Mortgagor agrees to pay all expenses of\n               collection, enforcement, valuation, appraisal or protection of\n               Lender\u2019s rights and remedies under this Security Instrument or\n               any other document relating to the Secured Debts. Mortgagor\n               agrees to pay expenses for tender to inspect, valuate, appraise\n               and preserve the Property and for any recordation costs of\n               releasing the Property from this Security Instrument. Expenses\n               include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees after\n               default and referral to an attorney not a salaried employee of\n               Lender. These expenses are due and payable immediately. If not\n               paid immediately, these expenses will bear interest from the date\n               of payment until paid in full at the highest interest rate in effect as\n               provided for in the terms of the Secured Debts. In addition, to\n               the extent permitted by the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n               Mortgagor agrees to pay the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred\n               by Lender to protect Lender\u2019s rights and interests in connection\n               with any bankruptcy proceedings initiated by or against\n               Mortgagor.\n\n\n       Ex. Vol. 19 p. 141. The mortgage documents further provide that\n\n\n               On or after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may\n               use any and all remedies Lender has under state or federal law or\n               in any document related to the Secured Debts. Any amounts\n               advanced on Mortgagor\u2019s behalf will be immediately and may be\n               added to the balance owing under the Secured Debts.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 53 of 56\n\f       Ex.

App. 1991). \u201cAs such, the\n\n       individual parties have a right to define their mutual rights and obligations.\u201d Id.\n\n       The language agreed to by First Bank and EdgeRock does not base First Bank\u2019s\n\n       right to recover attorney\u2019s fees on a judicial determination that EdgeRock has\n\n       defaulted on the terms of the mortgage agreement, but rather merely indicates\n\n       that attorney\u2019s fees are \u201cdue and payable immediately\u201d following default. Ex.\n\n       Vol. 19 p. 141. First Bank asserts that EdgeRock has defaulted in two ways,\n\n       neither of which any party appears to contest occurred. Given First Banks\u2019s\n\n       seemingly undisputed claim that EdgeRock has defaulted on the First Bank\n\n       Mortgage, we conclude that pursuant to the terms of the First Bank Mortgage,\n\n       First Bank adequately demonstrated that EdgeRock had defaulted on the\n\n       parties\u2019 agreement, and, as a result, is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the\n\n       express terms of the mortgage agreement.\n\n\n       2.      Requests for Appellate Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n[85]   Garmong, Fox, and Signworks each request an award of appellate attorney\u2019s\n\n       fees. The IMLS provides at Indiana Code section 32-28-3-14 that \u201ca plaintiff or\n\n       lienholder who recovers a judgment in any sum is entitled to recover reasonably\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d \u201cThe statute also encompasses attorney\u2019s fees associated with\n\n       appellate proceedings.\u201d Ambrose v. Dalton Const., Inc., 44 N.E.3d 707, 715 (Ind.\n\n       Ct. App. 2015), as clarified on reh\u2019g, 51 N.E.3d 320 (Ind. Ct. App. 2016), trans.\n\n       denied. Given that we have concluded that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 54 of 56\n\f       liens are invalid, we further conclude that neither is entitled to receive an award\n\n       of appellate attorney\u2019s fees under the IMLS.\n\n\n[86]   Signworks limits its request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees to EdgeRock, claiming\n\n       that \u201c[a]lthough Edge[R]ock has appealed no issues as to Signworks, this\n\n       appeal is still part of Signworks\u2019[s] efforts to collect the debt owed by\u201d\n\n       EdgeRock. Signworks\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 17. Signworks does not have a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien against EdgeRock\u2019s property and is therefore not entitled to an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees under the IMLS. Moreover, while Indiana\n\n       Appellate Rule 66(E) provides that this court may assess damages, including an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, if an appeal is frivolous or in bad faith, we\n\n       \u201cuse extreme restraint when exercising this power because of the potential\n\n       chilling effect upon the exercise of the right to appeal.\u201d Kelley v. Kelley, 158\n\n       N.E.3d 396, 400 (Ind. Ct. App. 2020). Given the complexity of the claims\n\n       presented on appeal, we cannot say that Signworks is entitled to an award of\n\n       appellate attorney\u2019s fees under Appellate Rule 66(E).\n\n\n\n       Conclusion\n[87]   In sum, we conclude as follows: (1) Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens are\n\n       invalid as to both ZPS\u2019s property and EdgeRock\u2019s property, (2) the trial court\n\n       erred in including the value of uninstalled materials in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien against ZPS\u2019s property and the trial court\u2019s in rem judgment against ZPS\n\n       should be reduced by that amount, (3) the trial court erred in ordering ZPS to\n\n       pay Signworks prejudgment interest, (4) the First Bank Mortgage has priority\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 55 of 56\n\f       over all remaining encumbrances on EdgeRock\u2019s property that are at issue in\n\n       the instant appeal, (5) the trial court did not err in denying EdgeRock\u2019s motion\n\n       for summary judgment with regard to Change Order 3 or in granting summary\n\n       judgment in favor of Garmong with regard to the scope-of-work question, (6)\n\n       distribution of the RIF Funds is stayed pending a ruling by the Hamilton\n\n       Commercial Court in Cause No. PL-5088 regarding priority of the secured\n\n       interests in the funds and any future ruling from this court regarding the RIF\n\n       Funds should be consistent with that of the Hamilton Commercial Court, (7)\n\n       First Bank is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the terms of the\n\n       First Bank Mortgage, and (8) neither Garmong, Fox, nor Signworks is entitled\n\n       to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In reaching these conclusions, we\n\n       reiterate that our conclusions do not affect the monetary judgments entered\n\n       against EdgeRock on Garmong\u2019s, Fox\u2019s, and Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract\n\n       claims and those judgments remain in effect. On remand, we instruct the trial\n\n       court to enter an amended judgment consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n[88]   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the\n\n       matter is remanded with instructions.\n\n\n       Riley, J., and Weissmann, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 56 of 56\n\f","Court of Appeals\nof the State of Georgia\n\n                                        ATLANTA,____________________\n                                                 January 19, 2024\n\nThe Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:\n\nA24A0744.

The two\nbegan messaging on Instagram, where Boykins used the name \u201cTurbo Hefner.\u201d\nSoon thereafter, while still seventeen, T.M. moved in with Boykins, and Boykins\nbegan having her engage in prostitution. Boykins created online profiles for T.M.\non the website Seeking Arrangements and, initially, handled messaging those who\nresponded. Boykins also took nude photos of T.M. on his cell phone \u201c[t]o send to\n\fcustomers.\u201d At least one of the sexually explicit photos that Boykins took of T.M.\nfor \u201cbusiness, to send out\u201d was found on his phone. The phone also contained\nanother explicit photo that T.M. sent to Boykins at his request. Boykins sent that\nphoto from his phone to a contact labeled \u201cDavid from Seeking Arrangements.\u201d In\nboth photos, T.M. was seventeen.\n\n       A federal grand jury indicted Boykins on charges of sex trafficking, sex\ntrafficking of a minor, and production and distribution of child pornography. He\nwas arrested, pleaded not guilty, and proceeded to trial. The district court1 denied\nBoykins\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal, and the jury found Boykins guilty on\nall counts. Boykins now appeals, arguing that the district court improperly admitted\ninsufficiently authenticated evidence and that the properly admitted evidence was\ninsufficient to support the child pornography convictions.\n\n        We first address Boykins\u2019s argument that the district court erred by admitting\ninsufficiently authenticated electronic-communication and social-media evidence\nobtained from Boykins\u2019s phone. Boykins stipulated to the admissibility of the\nchallenged evidence at trial, yet now claims error based on its admission. We have\nrepeatedly held that a defendant waives his right to challenge the admission of\nevidence after stipulating to its admissibility. See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez,\n984 F.3d 704, 710 (8th Cir. 2021) (stipulating to admissibility of a transcript of an\naudio recording precluded the defendant from subsequently claiming error based on\nalleged inaccuracies in that transcript); see also United States v. Mezzanatto, 513\nU.S. 196, 202 (1995) (\u201c[A]greements to waive evidentiary rules are generally\nenforceable even over a party\u2019s subsequent objections.\u201d). At the beginning of trial,\nBoykins stipulated to the admissibility of all exhibits except two photos not at issue\nin this appeal. His counsel also acknowledged that all the exhibits being admitted\u2014\nincluding the now-challenged exhibits\u2014\u201ccompl[ied] with the rules of evidence.\u201d\nThus, Boykins waived his right to raise a subsequent challenge to the authentication\nof the electronic-communication and social-media evidence.\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable James M. Moody Jr., United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Arkansas.\n                                  -2-\n\f       Moreover, even if we found his challenge was not waived, it still fails. \u201cWe\nusually review challenges to the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of\ndiscretion, reversing only if an error was not harmless.\u201d United States v. White Bull,\n646 F.3d 1082, 1091 (8th Cir. 2011). \u201cIf the admission of a contested piece of\nevidence was not timely objected to at trial, however, we review for plain error.\u201d Id.\nIn such instances, we reverse only if the defendant shows \u201c(1) an error, (2) that was\nplain, and (3) affects substantial rights, and that (4) the error seriously affects the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v.\nLewis, 673 F.3d 758, 762 (8th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Boykins raised his objection to the authentication of the electronic-\ncommunication and social-media evidence for the first time on appeal, so we review\nfor plain error. 2\n\n       \u201cTo satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that\nthe item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d Fed.

Evid. 901(a). \u201cSufficient\nevidence may include the testimony of a witness with knowledge, or \u2018the\nappearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics\nof the item, taken together with all the circumstances.\u2019\u201d United States v. Lamm, 5\nF.4th 942, 946 (8th Cir. 2021) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1), (b)(4)). \u201c[T]he party\nauthenticating the exhibit need only prove a rational basis for that party\u2019s claim that\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        \u201cTo preserve an error for appellate review, an objection must . . . clearly state\nthe grounds for the objection.\u201d United States v. Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th Cir.\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Boykins argues that he preserved these\narguments for appeal by objecting to a lack of foundation when FBI Special Agent\nDaniel Turner and the Government attributed messages from the phone to Boykins\nduring Turner\u2019s testimony. Boykins made no mention of authentication, nor is it\nclear that he intended to challenge the admissibility of the text messages themselves.\nEven if the objection had sufficed to preserve this narrow authentication challenge,\nwe would conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding\nsufficient authentication of the phone and its contents. See United States v. Turner,\n934 F.3d 794, 798 (8th Cir. 2019).\n                                          -3-\n\fthe document is what it is asserted to be.\u201d United States v. Ramirez-Martinez, 6\nF.4th 859, 866 (8th Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Boykins first challenges the admission of electronic-communication evidence\nextracted from the cell phone, specifically photos and messages. Testimony from\nT.M. and Special Agent Turner established that the phone belonged to Boykins, that\nBoykins gave the number associated with the phone to law enforcement as his\ncontact number, that Boykins admitted to arresting officers that the phone was his,\nthat Boykins kept the phone password protected, that T.M. never used it, and that\nT.M. never saw anyone except Boykins use it. Special Agent Turner also stated that\nthere were messages on the phone where the author referred to himself by Boykins\u2019s\nnickname \u201cTurbo.\u201d T.M. identified a sexually explicit photograph of herself from\nthe phone that she testified was taken by Boykins on his phone \u201c[f]or business, to\nsend out\u201d when she was seventeen years old. T.M. further testified that, at Boykins\u2019s\nrequest, she sent him sexually explicit photographs of herself when she was still\nseventeen for use in the business, and she specifically identified one of those photos\nthat was subsequently sent from Boykins\u2019s phone to someone else. The court did\nnot plainly err in admitting the messages and photo evidence from the phone, as the\nevidence presented by the Government \u201ccertainly meets the undemanding \u2018rational\nbasis\u2019 standard\u201d and suffices to properly authenticate them. See id. at 866-67; United\nStates v. Turner, 934 F.3d at 798.\n\n       Boykins also challenges the admission of content from his Instagram account.\nWe recognize that authentication of social media evidence may present some\n\u201cspecial challenges because of the great ease with which a social media account may\nbe falsified or a legitimate account may be accessed by an imposter.\u201d Lamm, 5 F.4th\nat 947. Nonetheless, we have been clear that, just as with phone messages and\nimages, \u201cthe Government may authenticate social media evidence with\ncircumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the social media account.\u201d Id. at\n948. Here, T.M. testified to messaging with Boykins via the account. The author of\nmessages from the account referred to himself by Boykins\u2019s known nickname, and\nthe account was registered to his email. Thus, the court did not plainly err in\nadmitting the social media content at trial.\n                                         -4-\n\f      Boykins also argues that, because the challenged electronic-communication\nand social-media evidence should have been excluded, insufficient evidence\nsupported the child-pornography convictions. Because the challenged evidence was\nproperly admitted, this argument also fails. See United States v. Pliego, 578 F.3d\n938, 941 (8th Cir. 2009) (standard of review). A reasonable jury could find Boykins\nguilty of both production and distribution of child pornography based on the\nevidence described above. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a), 2252(a)(2).\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f","                 United States Court of Appeals\n                            For the Eighth Circuit\n                        ___________________________\n\n                                No. 23-2907\n                        ___________________________\n\n                            United States of America\n\n                                      Plaintiff - Appellee\n\n                                        v.\n\n                                Martin Wilson, Jr.\n\n                                    Defendant - Appellant\n                                  ____________\n\n                     Appeal from United States District Court\n               for the Eastern District of Missouri - Cape Girardeau\n                                  ____________\n\n                           Submitted: January 10, 2024\n                             Filed: January 19, 2024\n                                  [Unpublished]\n                                 ____________\n\nBefore COLLOTON, BENTON, and KELLY, Circuit Judges.\n                          ____________\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n      Martin Wilson appeals the Guidelines-range sentence the district court1\nimposed after he pled guilty to a drug offense.

He argues that the sentence is substantively\nunreasonable because the district court gave insufficient weight to Wilson\u2019s history\nand characteristics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\n       The district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence. The\nrecord reflects that the court adequately considered the section 3553(a) factors\u2014\nincluding all of the information Wilson presented for the court\u2019s consideration\u2014and\ndid not clearly err in weighing the factors. See United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d\n455, 461-62 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (abuse of discretion occurs when court fails to\nconsider relevant factor, gives significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor, or\ncommits clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factor); United States v.\nStults, 575 F.3d 834, 849 (8th Cir. 2009) (sentence is not unreasonable when court\nmade individualized assessment based on facts presented and addressed defendant's\nproffered information in its consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors).\n\n      The court has independently reviewed the record under Penson v.

See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The two\nissues identified in an Anders brief are the enforceability of an appeal waiver in his\nplea agreement and the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. See Anders v.\n\fCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). A pro se supplemental brief questions the validity\nof the guilty plea itself.\n\n       The challenge to the plea falls outside the appeal waiver, see United States v.\nSchneider, 40 F.4th 849, 853 (8th Cir. 2022), but we conclude that Harbour acted\nvoluntarily and knowingly in entering into it and the district court 1 had a reasonable\nbasis to determine that he committed the offense, see United States v. Frook, 616\nF.3d 773, 775\u201376 (8th Cir. 2010) (reviewing for plain error when the defendant did\nnot object); see also United States v. Christenson, 653 F.3d 697, 700 (8th Cir. 2011)\n(explaining that facts from the plea agreement and presentence report can establish\na factual basis). And then, by virtue of the waiver itself, Harbour relinquished the\nright to challenge the reasonableness of the sentence. See United States v. Scott, 627\nF.3d 702, 704 (8th Cir. 2010) (reviewing the validity of an appeal waiver de novo);\nUnited States v. Andis, 333 F.3d 886, 889\u201392 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (explaining\nthat an appeal waiver will be enforced if the appeal falls within its scope, the\ndefendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement and the waiver,\nand enforcing it would not result in a miscarriage of justice).\n\n      Finally, we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that no\nother non-frivolous issues exist.2 See Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 82\u201383 (1988).\nWe accordingly affirm for the most part, dismiss the sentencing challenge, grant\ncounsel permission to withdraw, and deny the motion to appoint new counsel as\nmoot.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Brian C.

Bennett (Mother) in contempt for failing to follow\nthe terms of its Order Modifying Decree of Divorce and entered judgment against her. She\nappeals, and we affirm.\n\n                                                    ISSUE\n\n[\u00b62]    Mother presented two issues on appeal, which we consolidate as one:\n\n                 1. Did the district court err when it found Mother in contempt?\n\n                                                    FACTS\n\n[\u00b63] Matthew J. (Father) and Rachel E. (Mother) Bennett divorced in 2013. The 2018\nStipulated Order Modifying Stipulated Decree of Divorce (Decree) awarded Father\nprimary physical custody of their two minor children, and the parties were to share joint\nlegal custody. The Decree contained other provisions relevant to this appeal. First, the\nparents were required to split the payments evenly for any uninsured medical expenses.\nSecond, the parents were to follow all medical directives pertaining to the children. Third,\nthe parents were to seek each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\ndecision regarding the children\u2019s health, education, or welfare.\n\n[\u00b64] In 2022, Father filed a motion for order to show cause, asking the district court to\norder Mother to appear and show cause why the court should not hold her in contempt for\nfailing to comply with the three Decree provisions listed above, among others. 1 At the order\nto show cause hearing, the district court issued an oral ruling finding Mother in contempt,\nwhich was followed by a written order. The district court entered judgment for the unpaid\nmedical bills of $4,652.07 and awarded Father attorney fees. Mother appeals the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment and order finding her in contempt for failing to pay her share of uninsured\nmedical bills; to follow medical directives; and to seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before\nreengaging the children in counseling. 2\n\n\n\n1\n  Father also claimed Mother: (1) failed to nurture love and respect for him; (2) disparaged him to the\nchildren; (3) failed to train the children to obey and respect their teachers and the law; (4) failed to personally\nsupervise one of the children; (5) engaged in obscenities in front of the children; (6) intruded upon his\nprivacy and falsely made or implied mean statements about him; and (7) vilified him, all in violation of the\nDecree.\n2\n  The district court also found Mother in contempt of the Decree\u2019s civility provisions because she sent\nFather inappropriate text messages, she accused Father of poaching in front of one of the children, and she\nmade derogatory statements about him to a third party. Mother does not appeal those contempt findings.\nThe district court did not find her in contempt for lack of supervision or for failing to train the children to\nobey and respect their teachers and the law.\n\n\n                                                        1\n\f                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b65] \u201cDistrict courts have the inherent power to punish contempt, and we will not disturb\na contempt order in a domestic relations case absent a \u2018serious procedural error, a violation\nof a principle of law, or a clear and grave abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d Heimer v. Heimer, 2021\nWY 97, \u00b6 31, 494 P.3d 472, 481 (Wyo. 2021) (quoting Breen v. Black, 2020 WY 94, \u00b6 8,\n467 P.3d 1023, 1026 (Wyo. 2020)); Jenkins v.

Walters, 2011 WY 41, \u00b6 18, 249 P.3d 214,\n227 (Wyo. 2011)). \u201cFactual findings are clearly erroneous when, although they have\nevidentiary support, we are left with the definite and firm conviction upon review of the\nentire evidence that the district court made a mistake.\u201d Id. (quoting Walters, 2011 WY 41,\n\u00b6 18, 249 P.3d at 227.)\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n[\u00b67]   In Heimer, we said:\n\n                     To establish civil contempt, the plaintiff must show by\n              clear and convincing evidence that: 1) there was an effective\n              court order requiring certain conduct by the alleged contemnor;\n              2) the contemnor had knowledge of the order; and 3) the\n              alleged contemnor willfully disobeyed the order. In order to\n              find a willful violation, the order violated must be clear,\n              specific and unambiguous.\n\n                    A civil contempt order must be supported by clear and\n              convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is\n              evidence that would persuade a finder of fact that the truth of\n              the contention is highly probable. Once the elements of\n              contempt are proven, the burden then shifts to the person\n              charged with contempt to show he or she was unable to\n              comply.\n\nHeimer, 2021 WY 97, \u00b6 15, 494 P.3d at 477 (quoting Breen, 2020 WY 94, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 467\nP.3d at 1027). \u201cUsing this framework, we consider the district court\u2019s contempt findings.\u201d\nJLK v. MAB, 2016 WY 73, \u00b6 22, 375 P.3d 1108, 1113 (Wyo. 2016).\n\n\n                                             2\n\fI.     The district court did not err when it found Mother in contempt.\n\nA.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to pay her share of the\n       uninsured medical expenses.\n\n[\u00b68] Mother contends the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\npay her share of the uninsured medical expenses. We disagree. The Decree lists the relevant\nrequirements for the parents; Father and Mother \u201cshall share the responsibility equally for\npaying any uninsured medical, dental, orthodontic, optometric, ophthalmologic, mental\nhealth and all similar or related expenses incurred by the minor child.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[t]he\nparent incurring uninsured medical expenses for the minor child shall submit the bills for\nsaid expenses . . . to the other parent no later than thirty (30) days of receiving such bills[,]\u201d\nand \u201c[t]he other parent shall promptly remit payment for such expenses no later than thirty\n(30) days after being presented with a bill for such services[.]\u201d\n\n[\u00b69] Father and Mother both testified at the order to show cause hearing. Mother claimed\nshe did not have enough information to comply with the Decree. She testified she had seen\nand opened the bills from Father, had the funds and resources available to make payments,\nbut she did not because she did not know the terms of Father\u2019s health insurance policy and\nthe amounts not covered by insurance. Father\u2019s Exhibit 1, admitted into evidence without\nobjection, contained his spreadsheet tracking the total amount of uninsured medical\nexpenses for the children and the half Mother owed. Exhibit 1 also contained copies of the\nbills and evidence Father had sent the bills to Mother. He testified a copy of his insurance\npolicy was on file with the court, he had given the Explanation of Benefits to Mother\ndirectly five times, and he had not received a payment for two and a half years.\n\n[\u00b610] The district court found:\n\n               I think that [Father] has clearly established that the mother has\n               not paid her half share of the unpaid medical expenses. There\n               is a clear provision . . . that puts the burden on [Mother] to pay\n               one-half of all uncovered medical expenses of the children\n               once she has been provided with the evidence, the bills and the\n               expenses.\n\n                       I do find that [Father] did establish that he provided the\n               medical bills and expenses to his ex-wife. Exhibit 1 is very\n               complete. And there is certainly evidence that [Mother] was\n               provided with the medical bills and records showing she did\n               have an obligation to pay half of those bills. I do find that her\n               failure to pay was willful.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                                              ...\n\n                     I don\u2019t buy her explanation that she did not have enough\n              information under the policy to pay the bills. I find [Father\u2019s]\n              testimony more credible, that he had provided her with\n              explanations and information, and that she just willfully\n              refused to pay her share of those bills.\n\n[\u00b611] Upon review, we find the district court did not err. Mother did not argue below the\norder was ambiguous and the conduct required of her was uncertain, so those arguments\nare waived. Fowles v. Fowles, 2017 WY 112, \u00b6 28, 402 P.3d 405, 411 (Wyo. 2017) (\u201cWe\ngenerally do not consider arguments on appeal that were not presented to the district\ncourt.\u201d) (citing Crofts v. State ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Game & Fish, 2016 WY 4, \u00b6 19, 367 P.3d\n619, 624 (Wyo. 2016)). We also reject Mother\u2019s argument the district court improperly\nshifted the burden to her under Breen v. Black. In its oral ruling, the district court\nacknowledged Breen:\n\n                     The Breen v. Black case that I\u2019ve cited is an interesting\n              case, somewhat similar set of facts where a father was alleging\n              that the mother had not paid her half share of the medical\n              expenses. The court in that particular case found that the father\n              had failed to meet his burden because he hadn\u2019t brought forth\n              the medical bills and hadn\u2019t sufficiently explained by clear and\n              convincing evidence that he had paid those bills.\n\n                     Here, in contrast, I think the Plaintiff, the father, has met\n              that burden. He has shown that he paid those bills and did\n              provide the bills to [Mother] to pay. She did not pay those bills.\n\n[\u00b612] The district court correctly interpreted and applied Breen. Father submitted evidence\nshowing he provided the bills to Mother and she had not paid her portion. The district court\nproperly shifted the burden to Mother to prove payment, and she did not. Further, the\ndistrict court found Father\u2019s testimony more credible, and \u201c[o]ur rule is that the credibility\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved by\nthe finder of fact.\u201d JLK, 2016 WY 73, \u00b6 28, 375 P.3d at 1114 (quoting McAdam v. McAdam,\n2014 WY 123, \u00b6 26, 335 P.3d 466, 472 (Wyo. 2014)). \u201cGiving these weight and credibility\ndeterminations their due deference, we can find no abuse of discretion[.]\u201d Id. The district\ncourt did not err.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fB.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to follow medical\n       directives regarding their oldest child.\n\n[\u00b613] Next, Mother contends the district court erred when it held Mother in contempt for\nfailing to follow medical directives for the parents\u2019 oldest child. The Decree provided: \u201call\nmedical directives pertaining to the minor children must be followed th[r]ough.\u201d\n\n[\u00b614] At the order to show cause hearing, Father testified their oldest son was diagnosed\nwith constipation. Two doctors gave directives for a treatment plan that called for the child\nto take MiraLAX and Ex-Lax daily. Mother did not follow through on this directive\nregularly, which required the regimen to be \u201creset\u201d instead of keeping it at the daily\nmaintenance phase. Mother presented conflicting testimony, claiming she always followed\nthe doctors\u2019 recommendations; however, she also stated: \u201cI won\u2019t give my son Ex-Lax\nevery day.\u201d\n\n[\u00b615] In its oral ruling, the district court stated:\n\n                      I also find that she is in contempt for failing to follow\n               medical directives that have been provided to her by the\n               doctors with respect to having her oldest child, who suffers\n               from a constipation issue, take the medication that is required\n               to take, the MiraLAX and the Ex-Lax. Medical records have\n               established that they \u2013 that the son had a daily regimen which\n               required him to take that.\n\n                       And by her own testimony, [Mother] does not believe\n               that the Ex-Lax should be given, and where the doctors have\n               stated that it should be given to the child. So I find that she is\n               in contempt for failing to follow the medical directives.\n\n[\u00b616] On appeal, Mother claims the order and medical directives were unclear and the\ndistrict court violated her rights to parent and make health care decisions for her child under\nthe Wyoming Constitution. Mother did not raise these arguments below, and although this\nCourt can consider jurisdictional or issues of a fundamental nature for the first time on\nappeal, \u201c[t]he fact that an issue touches on constitutional principles does not necessarily\nmake it so fundamental the waiver rule does not apply.\u201d Snyder v. Snyder, 2021 WY 115,\n\u00b6 26, 496 P.3d 1255, 1261 (Wyo. 2021) (citing Gjertsen v. Haar, 2015 WY 56, \u00b6 15, 347\nP.3d 1117, 1123 (Wyo. 2015)) (finding appellant\u2019s constitutional claims waived as he made\n\u201cno effort to demonstrate why his argument was not waived and deserves consideration on\nappeal even though he did not raise it below\u201d). Further, Mother did not demonstrate why\nher arguments are not waived or merit consideration on appeal. Therefore this Court will\nnot address these arguments.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f[\u00b617] Based on the testimony presented by the parties at the order to show cause hearing,\nthe district court could reasonably conclude as it did. We therefore find no abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\nC.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to seek Father\u2019s advice\n       and consent before reengaging the children in counseling.\n\n[\u00b618] Mother argues the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\nconsult Father before reengaging the children in counseling. The Decree provided:\n\n               c. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to\n                  necessary and\/or elective medical procedures, whenever\n                  possible and shall advise each other at all times of any\n                  issues affecting the welfare of the children[.]\n\n               d. The parties shall, to the extent possible or practicable, seek\n                  each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\n                  decision concerning the minor children\u2019s health, education\n                  or welfare[.]\n\n[\u00b619] Father testified both children had seen a licensed professional counselor in the past,\nbut he thought counseling had ended when the counselor retired. Father later learned\nMother had retained the same counselor to make home visits while the children visited\nMother. Father testified he was not consulted about their children reengaging in counseling.\nMother testified she reengaged the counselor for the children and stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell\n[Father] specifically, but I didn\u2019t tell the boys it was a secret. . . . I thought if I was paying\nfor it, I could do that.\u201d\n\n[\u00b620] The district court found Mother violated the consultation provisions:\n\n                      It is concerning to the court that in October of 2021 the\n               evidence shows that [Mother] did decide on her own that she\n               wanted to reengage the services of [counselor]. She did not\n               discuss that decision or did not discuss that decision with\n               [Father] before she did it.\n\n                       [Father], the court notes, is the final decision-maker\n               with respect to medical decisions for the children and was\n               entitled to be advised and consulted before [Mother]\n               unilaterally decided on her own to reengage the services of\n               [counselor]. So I find her in contempt[.]\n\n\n                                                6\n\f[\u00b621] The Decree did not make the consultation requirement contingent on who paid for\nthe children\u2019s treatment or services, so Mother was not excused from the requirement\nbecause she paid the counselor directly. The testimony of both parties showed Mother did\nnot seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before reengaging the boys in counseling, and the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in holding Mother in contempt for that violation.\nLike her constitutional claims described above, Mother\u2019s additional argument that this\ncontempt finding violates her constitutional right to parent and make medical decisions for\nher children is waived because she did not raise it below.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n[\u00b622] The district court did not err when it held Mother in contempt, and we affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and order.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f","NOTICE: This opinion is subject to motions for reargument under V.R.A.P. 40 as well as formal\nrevision before publication in the Vermont Reports.

CARROLL, J.         Defendant Jason Bockus appeals a judgment of conviction for\n\nassault and robbery following a jury trial. He contends that the trial court erred in not suppressing\n\nout-of-court noneyewitness identifications and denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant also argues that the court impermissibly punished him with a harsher sentence for\n\nexercising his right to go to trial. We affirm.\n\n                                           I. Background\n\n        \u00b6 2.   The following is adduced from testimony and exhibits admitted at trial, and from\n\nfacts found by the trial court in its order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress out-of-court\n\nidentifications. In early December 2020, a man entered an Irving service station in Highgate,\n\fVermont just before 11 p.m. Multiple surveillance cameras showed the man wearing a hoodie,\n\nbeanie, and mask that obscured most, but not all of, his face. The man told the two service-station\n\nemployees on duty that he had a gun and ordered them to open the cash drawer. One of the\n\nattendants opened the drawer. The man took $190 and left. Neither attendant could identify the\n\nman.\n\n        \u00b6 3.     Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Baker led the investigation into the\n\nrobbery. She posted stills of the suspect taken from the surveillance footage to the Vermont State\n\nPolice Facebook page. A local resident, Christopher Uzell, responded to the posting and told\n\nDetective Baker that defendant resembled the suspect. He informed Detective Baker that he had\n\nknown defendant for about twenty years and recognized defendant\u2019s distinctive eyes. In addition\n\nto using the surveillance footage to obtain further positive identifications from defendant\u2019s\n\nprobation officer, Greg Machia, and the manager of a sober house where defendant had once lived,\n\nHarley LaRocque, Detective Baker questioned several members of defendant\u2019s family to confirm\n\nthe identity of the perpetrator.\n\n        \u00b6 4.     Detective Baker interviewed each family member individually and used the same\n\nprocedure with each person. She told them that she was investigating the robbery at the Irving\n\nstation in Highgate and asked to show them surveillance footage and stills of the footage to see if\n\nthey recognized the perpetrator. Detective Baker first played surveillance footage, then showed\n\nstills from the footage, and then, following the person\u2019s identification of defendant, showed a\n\nmugshot and a Facebook photograph from defendant\u2019s personal account to confirm that they were\n\ntalking about the same person. She did not tell them that she suspected defendant of committing\n\nthe crime depicted in the presentation materials, and she provided no commentary while they\n\nwatched the footage.1 Ultimately, defendant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, TJ and Chantell Bockus,\n\n\n\n        1\n            There was no audio recording of the incident.\n                                                  2\n\fdefendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, Brittany Blaisdell, and Blaisdell\u2019s mother, Deena\n\nRaymond, all identified defendant as the suspect. Each person expressed their belief that defendant\n\nwas the perpetrator because the person in the video had defendant\u2019s same distinctive body\n\nmovements and unique eyes, among other characteristics. Some family members informed one\n\nanother that they believed defendant \u201cmight\u201d be the person depicted in the footage prior to\n\nDetective Baker\u2019s questioning. For various reasons, each family member expressed fear that\n\ndefendant could retaliate if he learned that they had identified him, and frustration with \u201cthe\n\nsystem\u201d in which defendant had been involved for years.\n\n       \u00b6 5.      Based on the above, the State charged defendant with one count of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), and with being a habitual offender with three\n\nprior felony convictions, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 11, which carried the possibility of life imprisonment.\n\n       \u00b6 6.      Defendant moved to suppress the out-of-court identifications made by Chantell and\n\nTJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena Raymond under Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution.\n\nHe contended that Detective Baker had used an unduly suggestive comparison lineup to obtain the\n\nidentifications, and because the noneyewitnesses knew others had already identified defendant\n\nbefore viewing the presentation themselves, their own identifications were tainted by confirmation\n\nbias. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Detective\n\nBaker had not used unnecessarily suggestive investigation techniques, that suggestive\n\ncircumstances not created by law enforcement are \u201cirrelevant\u201d under State v. Porter, 2014 VT 89,\n\n197 Vt. 330, 103 A.3d 916, and that even if the circumstances were suggestive, the identifications\n\nwere reliable.\n\n       \u00b6 7.      At trial, Uzell, Machia, LaRocque, the Bockuses, and Blaisdell testified for the\n\nState. Uzell testified that he was eighty-percent sure of his identification, Machia said that he was\n\nmore than \u201cninety-nine-point nine percent sure,\u201d and LaRocque averred that he was a \u201cseven or\n\neight\u201d on a scale of one to ten about his identification. Chantell and TJ Bockus, and Brittany\n\n                                                 3\n\fBlaisdell each testified that they were convinced that defendant was the perpetrator. The State\n\nalso called Lynn Knight, with whom defendant had been living at the time of the robbery. Knight\n\ntestified that she was initially seventy-five percent sure that defendant was the perpetrator, but later\n\ndisclaimed her identification.\n\n       \u00b6 8.    At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant argued that the State had failed to proffer sufficient evidence proving beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that he was the robber because it relied exclusively on out-of-court identifications\n\nby noneyewitnesses, many of whom harbored biases and \u201cagendas\u201d against defendant. He also\n\ncontended that the State failed to prove that the perpetrator had been carrying a deadly weapon\n\nduring the robbery. Taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the State, and excluding\n\nmodifying evidence, the court found that the State\u2019s witnesses had credibly testified that defendant\n\nwas the suspect in the surveillance footage, and the service-station employees had credibly testified\n\nthat it appeared to them that the man had been carrying a handgun.\n\n       \u00b6 9.    At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on the elements of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon as follows:\n\n               (1) [defendant]; (2) [a]ttempted to put . . . gas station store\n               clerks . . . in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; (3) [h]e did so\n               by using physical menace; (4) [h]e also took money or other\n               property . . . (5) [h]e took the money or other property with the\n               intent to deprive [the gas station] of it permanently; and (6) [a]t the\n               time, he was armed with a dangerous weapon.\n\nThe court clarified that: \u201cphysical menace means a threat by word or act to inflict physical injury\n\nupon another person\u201d and that \u201cthe State alleges that Mr. Bockus attempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband.\u201d The State requested an instruction on the lesser-included\n\ncharge of assault and robbery. Without objection, the court instructed the jury that the first five\n\nelements of assault and robbery were \u201cdefined in the same way as they are defined for assault and\n\n\n                                                   4\n\frobbery with a deadly weapon,\u201d except that \u201c[t]he State need not have proven that Mr. Bockus[]\n\nwas armed with a dangerous weapon at the time.\u201d\n\n       \u00b6 10.   The jury found defendant not guilty of assault and robbery with a deadly weapon.\n\nIt found him guilty of the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery, and of being a habitual\n\noffender. At sentencing, the State recommended ten-to-twenty-five-years to serve. Defendant\n\nrequested a sentence of two-and-a-half-to-five-years to serve. The court ultimately sentenced\n\ndefendant ten-to-fifteen-years to serve, opining:\n\n               So even though the weight of the evidence was perhaps not\n               overwhelming, it was compelling, and the jurors certainly found that\n               it was. And while the Court can\u2019t comment on someone\u2019s\n               willingness and ability and right to go to trial, the fact is that folks\n               who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result because\n               they\u2019ve accepted responsibility. And Mr. Bockus certainly has not\n               accepted responsibility, which leads the Court to believe that the\n               programming part of this, to the extent that it exists, is probably not\n               going to be helpful for him because he\u2019s not at that point. I don\u2019t\n               even think he\u2019s, what they call, pre-contemplative at this point in\n               regards to his willingness to make changes in his life.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n       \u00b6 11.   Defendant advances several arguments on appeal. He argues that the court erred in\n\nnot suppressing the identifications made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond because Detective Baker used unnecessarily suggestive means to obtain the\n\nidentifications. Specifically, he contends that Detective Baker\u2019s decision to interview \u201cestranged\n\nfamily members\u201d was unnecessarily suggestive, as was her failure to ask the witnesses not to\n\ndiscuss their own identifications with each other. He argues that the identifications are also\n\nunreliable and should have been suppressed. Defendant asserts that the court improperly relied on\n\nState v. Porter for the proposition that suggestibility is irrelevant where the challenged\n\ncircumstances are not arranged by law enforcement. Defendant further contends that the court\n\nerred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and deprived him of due process by imposing\n\nan impermissibly harsh sentence because he exercised his right to trial.\n\n                                                    5\n\f       \u00b6 12.   We hold that the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We\n\nagree with the trial court that the identifications of defendant were not made under unduly\n\nsuggestive circumstances.      Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether the\n\nidentifications were reliable for purposes of defendant\u2019s due process rights, nor do we decide\n\nwhether we review purportedly suggestive out-of-court identifications not arranged by police\n\nunder Article 10. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nand detect no vindictiveness toward defendant from the trial court that would justify disturbing the\n\nsentence it imposed.\n\n                          II. Out-of-Court Noneyewitness Identifications\n\n       \u00b6 13.   We turn first to the question of whether the trial court should have suppressed the\n\nidentifications of defendant made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond. We review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions in an order denying a motion to suppress\n\nwithout deference and defer to its factual findings absent clear error. State v. Discola, 2018 VT 7,\n\n\u00b6 26, 207 Vt. 216, 184 A.3d 1177.\n\n       \u00b6 14.   The Vermont Constitution provides that criminal defendants shall have the right \u201cto\n\nbe confronted with the witnesses\u201d against them. Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10. The Court applies the\n\ntwo-part test first set forth in Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977), to determine whether an\n\nout-of-court identification procedure violates that right. Porter, 2014 VT 89, \u00b6 20, overruled on\n\nother grounds by Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 30. We first consider the circumstances surrounding the\n\nidentification to determine whether they were unnecessarily suggestive. State v. Kasper, 137 Vt.\n\n184, 192, 404 A.2d 85, 90 (1979), overruled on other grounds by Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 30. The\n\ntouchstone of this inquiry is whether the method was \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise\n\nto a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d State v. Mayo, 2008 VT 2, \u00b6 18,\n\n183 Vt. 113, 945 A.2d 846 (quotation omitted). Second, even \u201c[i]f suggestive, the identification\n\nis still admissible if certain indicia of reliability outweigh the corrupting effect of the suggestive\n\n                                                  6\n\fidentification.\u201d Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 27 (quotation omitted) (describing factors used to evaluate\n\nreliability).\n\n        \u00b6 15.   In determining whether an out-of-court identification was obtained under\n\nunnecessarily suggestive circumstances, in addition to considering the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we concentrate on the form of the presentation used by police. Mayo, 2008 VT 2,\n\n\u00b6 17. Factors we have considered include \u201chow the lineup was set up, how many photos were\n\narrayed, whether the photos were similar in size, color, or description, and the officer\u2019s\n\nadministration of the lineup.\u201d Id. This case presents the first time we have considered whether\n\npolice identification practices involving noneyewitnesses to a crime are unduly suggestive.\n\n        \u00b6 16.   The trial court found that each person spontaneously identified defendant only after\n\nwatching the surveillance footage without commentary from Detective Baker. Detective Baker\n\ndid not disclose defendant\u2019s name until after each person made a positive identification, at which\n\npoint she produced a photo of defendant to ensure that they were speaking about the same person.\n\nWe conclude that this procedure was not unduly suggestive. The form of Detective Baker\u2019s\n\npresentation is not like our prior cases involving suggestive methods where an eyewitness was\n\nshown a display of multiple photos of the defendant in a single array, Kasper, 137 Vt. at 192, 404\n\nA.2d at 90, a presentation consisting solely of one photo of the defendant was shown to an\n\neyewitness, State v. Findlay, 171 Vt. 594, 597, 765 A.2d 483, 487 (2000) (mem.), or an in-court\n\nidentification of a defendant was made by two eyewitnesses who had seen a photograph of the\n\ndefendant shortly before the hearing and who was dressed in a prisoner\u2019s uniform and bound in\n\nshackles. Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 28. In contrast to the identification procedures used in those\n\ncases, Detective Baker did not show unmasked depictions of defendant until after each\n\nnoneyewitness viewed the surveillance footage and identified defendant of their own accord. See\n\nState v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 386-87, 488 A.2d 1231, 1234 (1985) (holding procedure not\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fsuggestive where police showed eyewitness twenty-seven photographs one-by-one and made no\n\nsuggestions \u201cemphasizing one photograph over another\u201d).\n\n        \u00b6 17.   Moreover, because neither of the store employees could identify the perpetrator, it\n\nwas reasonable for Detective Baker to seek out family members who might be in a position to\n\nidentify him. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 130 N.E.3d 174, 186 (Mass. 2019) (holding that\n\npolice had \u201cgood reason\u201d to have victim\u2019s family members attempt to identify person in\n\nsurveillance footage where no eyewitnesses could do so). The totality of the circumstances in this\n\ncase\u2014including the nature of the surveillance footage, the tip Detective Baker received about the\n\npossible identity of the perpetrator, her choice to ask family members of defendant to identify the\n\nperpetrator via surveillance footage to confirm the tip, and the method she used to obtain the\n\nidentifications\u2014does not give rise to the danger of \u201cirreparable mistaken identification.\u201d\n\nBissonette, 145 Vt. at 385, 488 A.2d at 1233.\n\n        \u00b6 18.   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reached the same conclusion on similar\n\nfacts in Commonwealth v. Vasquez. There, surveillance cameras recorded audio and visual\n\ndepictions of a man shooting and killing a woman in a parked car. There were no \u201cpercipient\u201d\n\neyewitnesses to the shooting. 130 N.E.3d at 186. Police questioned members of the victim\u2019s\n\nfamily who, before arriving at the police station, had spoken to one another and surmised that the\n\nvictim had been involved in a shooting and that the defendant was the likely perpetrator.\n\nInterviewing the witnesses separately, police presented each witness, in order, a photograph of the\n\ndefendant, an audio recording of the incident, and surveillance footage. Police did not suggest the\n\ndefendant\u2019s involvement and provided no \u201cconfirmatory feedback\u201d to the witnesses. Id. at 185\n\nn.16.   The Massachusetts high court reasoned that the form of the presentation was not\n\nunnecessarily suggestive because, without eyewitnesses who could identify the perpetrator, police\n\nhad good reason to believe that the victim\u2019s family members were in a position to identify the\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fshooter from the surveillance footage, police presented the identification materials separately, and\n\nthey did not include the audio or visual depiction of the gunshot.2 Id. at 186.\n\n       \u00b6 19.   We are also unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that Detective Baker\u2019s failure to\n\nask the witnesses to not speak with one another amounted to undue suggestiveness. The court\n\nfound Detective Baker\u2019s testimony credible regarding the identification procedure she used and\n\nfound the witnesses\u2019 testimony credible regarding their own identifications. The court found that\n\neach credibly \u201ctestified that they independently identified [defendant] based off the video\n\nsurveillance footage,\u201d and that any biases and knowledge that others had already identified\n\ndefendant \u201chad minimal influence\u201d on their own identifications.3 Based on the court\u2019s findings,\n\nwe conclude that the challenged identifications were not tainted by confirmation bias or animosity\n\ntoward defendant, and therefore were not spoiled by undue suggestiveness. Mayo, 2008 VT 2,\n\n\u00b6 14 (deferring to trial court to determine weight of evidence and its persuasive effect, witness\n\ncredibility, and noting that trial court\u2019s rulings will be affirmed if supported by law).\n\n       \u00b6 20.   We concur, however, with the Massachusetts high court that \u201cit was not ideal that,\n\nprior to making an identification, each witness was apparently aware that the victim had been killed\n\nand suspected the defendant\u2019s involvement.\u201d Vasquez, 130 N.E.3d at 185 n.16. And we agree\n\nthat, where feasible to do so, police should direct witnesses not to speak about their perceptions\n\nwith other witnesses prior to the identification proceedings. See id. Law enforcement \u201ccannot be\n\nexpected to prevent every conceivable exposure to external information,\u201d but should \u201cguard\n\nagainst the risk that a witness may be influenced by his or her conversations with . . . family\n\nmembers . . . before making an identification.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n       2\n          We note that police in Vazquez showed each witness a photograph of the defendant\nbefore playing the audio and visual recordings, which was not done here.\n       3\n          While these findings appear in the court\u2019s reliability analysis, they clearly apply to\nDetective Baker\u2019s methodology, which the court itself noted.\n                                              9\n\f       \u00b6 21.   While not ideal, the mere fact that the witnesses, prior to their own identifications,\n\nwere aware that others had potentially identified defendant in the surveillance footage does not\n\nalone render the identifications suggestive. We emphasize that each case involving out-of-court\n\nidentifications is dependent on its own unique circumstances, and our holding is accordingly\n\nnarrow. Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 27 (explaining that courts must examine circumstances surrounding\n\nidentification procedure). Because the circumstances surrounding the identifications in this case\n\nwere not unduly suggestive, we need not reach the question of reliability. See Mayo, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19\n\n(explaining that where challenged procedure was not suggestive, Court need not proceed to step\n\ntwo of Brathwaite test to screen for reliability because procedure does not \u201cgive rise to a very\n\nsubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d (quotation omitted)).\n\n       \u00b6 22.   Defendant next takes issue with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that where police do\n\nnot arrange the suggestive circumstances, under State v. Porter, 2014 VT 89, Article 10 does not\n\napply to out-of-court identifications. Defendant spends considerable time in his briefing asking\n\nthe Court not to extend the U.S. Supreme Court case cited in Porter, Perry v. New Hampshire, 565\n\nU.S. 228 (2012), to the Vermont Constitution.4 He argues that we should instead hold that due\n\nprocess protections attach to all suggestive identifications, involving police or not, and that the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts follows this approach. We do not decide defendant\u2019s\n\nconstitutional claim because, as discussed above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the\n\nsuppression motion on an alternative basis, namely, that there were no suggestive identifications\n\nto begin with.5 See State v. Bauder, 2007 VT 16, \u00b6 27, 181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38 (\u201cIt is . . .a\n\n\n       4\n         In Perry, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, because the reliability screening function in\nBrathwaite test is designed to deter police misconduct, where suggestive identifications are not\narranged by police, courts do not need to screen for reliability. 565 U.S. at 241-42.\n       5\n          Defendant\u2019s citations to State v. Porter for the proposition that courts will limit or\nsuppress suggestive identification testimony is to the portion of the opinion reviewing the\ndefendant\u2019s preserved Vermont Rule of Evidence 403 claim, not his due process claim. See, e.g.,\n2014 VT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26; cf. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 45 N.E.3d 83, 88-90 (Mass. 2016)\n                                              10\n\ffundamental tenet of judicial restraint that courts will not address constitutional claims . . . when\n\nadequate lesser grounds are available.\u201d).\n\n                                     III. Judgment of Acquittal\n\n       \u00b6 23.   Defendant argues that the court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal. In effect, defendant contends that noneyewitnesses are insufficient to prove the identity\n\nelement where there is no physical evidence linking a defendant to a crime. He also argues that,\n\nas instructed, the jury could not have found defendant guilty of the lesser-included charge because\n\nthe State did not put on sufficient evidence to prove that defendant used physical menace to commit\n\nthe crime.\n\n       \u00b6 24.   We review a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal without deference to the\n\ntrial court. State v. Durenleau, 163 Vt. 8, 10, 652 A.2d 981, 982 (1994). We must \u201cdetermine\n\nwhether the evidence presented by the State, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution\n\nand excluding any modifying evidence, sufficiently and fairly supports a finding of guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Id.\n\n       \u00b6 25.   At trial, the State put on three nonfamily members\u2014Uzell, Machia, and\n\nLaRocque\u2014who testified that they were somewhere between seventy-percent sure and ninety-\n\nnine percent sure of defendant\u2019s identity based on the surveillance footage. Uzell and Machia\n\ntestified that they had known defendant for decades, and LaRocque had managed the group home\n\nwhere defendant lived in the months before the robbery. Chantell Bockus, TJ Bockus, and Brittany\n\nBlaisdell each testified that they were convinced defendant was the perpetrator and identified him\n\nin court. Though the Bockuses had not seen defendant in person since 2012, each testified that the\n\n\n\n(explaining that Massachusetts reviews suggestive out-of-court noneyewitness identifications not\narranged by law enforcement under its \u201ccommon law principles of fairness,\u201d including evidentiary\nrule 403) Defendant has not preserved a Rule 403 claim here, nor does he explain on appeal how\nit would have led to a different result than the reliability analysis in the Brathwaite test if he had\nraised it below. State v. Stanislaw, 153 Vt. 517, 528, 573 A.2d 286, 293 (1990) (explaining that\narguments not presented in proceedings below with sufficient particularity are waived).\n                                                 11\n\fperpetrator\u2019s distinctive body movements and unique eyes were immediately recognizable.\n\nBrittany Blaisdell testified that she had been in a three-and-a-half-year relationship with defendant\n\neight years prior, that she could identify defendant because of the distinctive way he carried\n\nhimself, and that she recognized his eyes because they were \u201cvery distinctive. Our daughter has\n\nhis eyes, so I see them all the time.\u201d This testimony, along with the surveillance videos admitted\n\ninto evidence, fairly and sufficiently supports a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the\n\nidentity element.\n\n       \u00b6 26.   Defendant next contends that the State proffered insufficient evidence to convict\n\nhim of the physical-menace element on the lesser-included charge. He asserts that the court\u2019s\n\ninstruction on the physical-menace element\u2014that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband\u201d\u2014is insufficient without further clarity to sustain a guilty\n\nverdict without a finding that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the robbery.\n\n       \u00b6 27.   We conclude that the instruction was accurate and consistent such that the jury\n\ncould acquit on assault and robbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), but nonetheless\n\nfind defendant guilty on the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery. The employees testified\n\nthat defendant lifted up his shirt and\/or \u201cmoved his jacket\u201d to show what they took to be \u201cthe butt\n\nof a gun\u201d or the handle of a gun, and that they were afraid. Based on this testimony, the State\n\nproffered sufficient evidence to prove that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to place [the\n\nservice-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them the weapon\n\nconcealed in his waistband.\u201d While possessing a dangerous weapon is an essential element to\n\nconvict under \u00a7 608(b), the jury could find that defendant did not possess a \u201creal gun capable of\n\nbodily injury,\u201d but \u201cthat defendant displayed what appeared to be a real gun which placed the\n\ncomplainant in fear of serious bodily injury.\u201d State v. Stone, No. 2010-346, 2011 WL 4984009,\n\nat *1 (Vt. June 1, 2011) (unpub. mem.) [https:\/\/perma.cc\/PC3D-4ERG]. The employees testified\n\n                                                 12\n\fthat defendant \u201cshowed\u201d them what they understood to be a gun, that it appeared to be partially\n\nconcealed in his waistband, and that they were afraid he would \u201cpull it on\u201d them. The State, as\n\ndefense counsel agreed, did not need to prove that defendant was actually armed with a dangerous\n\nweapon at the time he robbed the service station to prevail on the lesser-included charge.\n\nDefendant has failed to demonstrate error here.\n\n                                    IV. Vindictive Sentencing\n\n       \u00b6 28.   Defendant\u2019s final contention is that the court improperly punished him with a\n\nharsher sentence because he maintained his innocence and exercised his right to trial rather than\n\nplead prior to trial. This argument is without merit.\n\n       \u00b6 29.   Punishing a defendant for exercising their right to trial \u201cis a due process violation\n\nof the most basic sort.\u201d State v. Hughs, 2018 VT 74, \u00b6 12, 208 Vt. 44, 194 A.3d 1181 (quotation\n\nomitted). \u201cThis principle is so fundamental to our legal system that even the perception\u2014if not\n\nthe actuality of its abrogation should be avoided to prevent lasting damage to the public\u2019s\n\nperception of the inherent fairness of the criminal justice system.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 30.   When faced with an allegation of a vindictive sentence, we review the totality of\n\nthe record to determine whether to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. \u00b6 14. In doing so, we\n\ncompare the imposed sentence with both the statutory maximum and the sentence recommended\n\nby the State, determine whether the \u201cvast majority of the trial court\u2019s sentencing remarks focused\n\non legitimate sentencing considerations,\u201d and consider the context of the challenged comments.\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (quotation omitted). Ultimately, we will affirm a sentence \u201c[a]bsent exceptional\n\ncircumstances, [and] defer to the court\u2019s judgment so long as the sentence is within the statutory\n\nlimits and was not based on improper or inaccurate information.\u201d State v. Lumumba, 2014 VT\n\n85, \u00b6 22, 197 Vt. 315, 104 A.3d 627 (quotation omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 31.   Under the first factor, the court imposed a sentence of ten-to-fifteen years to serve,\n\nwhich was less than the maximum\u2014life imprisonment under the habitual-offender enhancement\u2014\n\n                                                  13\n\fand less than the ten-to-twenty-five years the State recommended. Defendant contends that the\n\ncourt gave the State \u201cthe benefit\u201d of a twenty-five-year sentence when it imposed the sentence\n\nconsecutive to defendant\u2019s currently imposed sentence for an unrelated conviction, which has a\n\nmaximum release date in 2032. However, the State was clear that its request was for ten-to-twenty-\n\nfive years to serve imposed consecutively to defendant\u2019s current sentence. Accordingly, we see\n\nno indication that the trial court intended to penalize defendant for exercising his right to trial by\n\nimposing a sentence out of proportion to the maximum penalty or to the State\u2019s recommendation.\n\nSee Hughs, 2018 VT 74, \u00b6 17.\n\n       \u00b6 32.   As to the second factor, the vast majority of the court\u2019s sentencing statements were\n\nfocused on legitimate sentencing matters. The court noted the factors it was required to consider,\n\nexpressly declined to comment on defendant\u2019s refusal to accept a plea offer, and observed that the\n\npresentencing investigation demonstrated that defendant was not taking responsibility for the\n\nconvictions. The court did opine that \u201cfolks who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result\n\nbecause they\u2019ve accepted responsibility.\u201d However, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\n\nfor the offense, and a sincere demonstration of remorse, are proper considerations in sentencing.\u201d\n\nState v. Sims, 158 Vt. 173, 188-89, 608 A.2d 1149, 1158 (1991) (explaining that such actions are\n\nimportant steps toward rehabilitation). The court\u2019s pretrial statements concerning the status of the\n\nplea negotiations, and characterizations of the plea offer itself, while not best practice, similarly\n\nrelated to whether defendant was willing to accept responsibility in light of the possibility of life\n\nimprisonment.6\n\n       \u00b6 33.   Under the third factor, the court\u2019s challenged comments occurred in the context of\n\ndefendant\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility. Defendant maintained his innocence and exercised\n\n\n\n       6\n         While defendant recounts the court\u2019s pretrial statements in his statement of facts, he does\nnot expressly argue that those statements contributed to the court\u2019s sentencing decision. However,\nwe discuss them in the interest of canvassing the entire record.\n                                                 14\n\fhis right to trial, called the convictions \u201cbullshit\u201d in the presentencing investigation, and did not\n\napologize, express remorse, or make any other statement indicating acceptance of responsibility at\n\nsentencing. Defendant was well within his rights to conduct himself in this way, and the court\n\ncould accordingly take that conduct into account as representative of his failure to take\n\nresponsibility for the convictions, and to fashion an appropriate sentence. The court did not abuse\n\nits discretion.\n\n        \u00b6 34.     Therefore, we affirm the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, his\n\njudgment of conviction, and the sentence imposed.\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n                                                FOR THE COURT:\n\n\n\n                                                Associate Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f","                                               Supreme Court\n\n                                               No. 2022-355-Appeal.\n                                               (PM 19-10798)\n\n\n\nIn re Orlando A.

The plaintiff, Clara Martins, appeals\n\nfrom a Superior Court judgment in favor of the intervenor, Isabel DaPina Costa,1\n\nfollowing the grant of the intervenor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This case\n\ncame before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear\n\nand show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily\n\ndecided. After considering the parties\u2019 written and oral submissions and reviewing\n\nthe record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be\n\ndecided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Multiple spellings of the intervenor\u2019s name appear in the record. We use the\niteration that appears in the motion to intervene. No disrespect is intended.\n\n                                       -1-\n\f                                          I\n\n                                  Facts and Travel\n\n      Orlando A. Da Cruz2 died on May 1, 2008. His obituary refers to intervenor\n\nas his \u201ccommon-law- wife\u201d [sic], and his death certificate names her as his spouse.\n\nThe plaintiff, Da Cruz\u2019s mother, argues that intervenor was never married to her son,\n\nand instead refers to intervenor\u2014with whom Da Cruz had three children\u2014as his\n\n\u201clive-in girlfriend.\u201d The present case stems from this dispute.\n\n                                Probate Proceedings\n\n      Born in Cape Verde, Da Cruz was a resident of Providence, Rhode Island, and\n\nworked for Brown University at the time of his death. According to plaintiff, while\n\nshe and other members of her family were making funeral arrangements, intervenor\n\n\u201cpresented herself to the funeral home\u201d and \u201cchanged [Da Cruz\u2019s] death certificate\n\nunder false pretenses.\u201d The funeral home published Da Cruz\u2019s obituary on May 5,\n\n2008, and described intervenor therein as his common-law wife.\n\n      Two days later, on May 7, 2008, the funeral home filed Da Cruz\u2019s death\n\ncertificate, which lists intervenor as not only his spouse but also the informant.3 In\n\n\n\n2\n  The last name \u201cDa Cruz\u201d appears in the record either with or without a space. We\nuse the iteration that appears on his death certificate and citizenship documents. No\ndisrespect is intended.\n3\n  An informant is someone who provides the funeral director, or another person\nauthorized to file a death certificate, with personal data about the decedent. See G.L.\n1956 \u00a7 23-3-16(b).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fher prebriefing statement, plaintiff implies that these details of the death certificate\n\nwere unknown to her until proceedings commenced in the Providence Probate Court\n\nthe following month. As for the obituary, plaintiff has claimed that she and other\n\nmembers of her family knew about and disputed the reference to intervenor as\n\nDa Cruz\u2019s common-law wife but did not seek a correction because they wanted to\n\n\u201cavoid additional family drama and distress.\u201d\n\n        In probate court, an attorney entered her appearance on plaintiff\u2019s behalf on\n\nJune 20, 2008, and plaintiff objected to the appointment of intervenor as\n\nadministratrix of Da Cruz\u2019s estate soon thereafter. According to plaintiff, intervenor\n\nnamed herself as Da Cruz\u2019s spouse in the initial administration petition.4 Litigation\n\nensued, during which plaintiff concedes in her prebriefing statement that the details\n\nof her son\u2019s death certificate \u201ccame to light.\u201d\n\n        On July 24, 2008, plaintiff and intervenor agreed to the appointment of a\n\nthird-party attorney as administrator of Da Cruz\u2019s estate. The probate court closed\n\nthe estate in 2010.\n\n        In her filings in Superior Court, plaintiff represented that she \u201cassumed that\n\nthe death certificate had been corrected\u201d during the probate proceedings but realized\n\nthis was not the case \u201cwhen she requested a new copy of her son\u2019s death certificate.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff does not state exactly when she made this request, but a copy of the\n\n\n4\n    The Providence Probate Court records are not part of the record on appeal.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdeath certificate attached to the complaint was issued on March 9, 2018. Sometime\n\nthereafter, \u201caround 2019,\u201d plaintiff sought legal advice regarding her own estate, and\n\nher legal counsel in Cape Verde advised her that Da Cruz\u2019s \u201cerroneous death\n\ncertificate would interfere with her estate planning and that she should get it\n\ncorrected as soon as practicable.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)\n\n                              First Round of Motions\n\n      On November 7, 2019, plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in Superior Court\n\nseeking to amend the death certificate. She also sent the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Health\u2019s Division of Vital Records a request to amend the death certificate that\n\nsame day.    A Superior Court summons named the Department of Health as\n\ndefendant, and the Department filed an answer stating that it lacked \u201cknowledge or\n\ninformation sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d Then,\n\non December 16, 2019, Costa filed a motion to intervene, which the Superior Court\n\ngranted.\n\n      The intervenor also filed motions to dismiss and for judgment on the\n\npleadings.   In the latter motion, intervenor argued that the limitations period\n\napplicable to plaintiff\u2019s claim, codified at G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-1-13(a), had expired.\n\nSection 9-1-13(a) states that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specially provided, all civil\n\nactions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall\n\naccrue, and not after.\u201d According to intervenor, the complaint and attachments\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f\u201cma[d]e it clear\u201d that plaintiff knew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named\n\nCosta as his spouse; therefore, she no longer had a viable cause of action in 2019\n\nwhen she filed the complaint.\n\n       In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings, plaintiff\u2014now represented by an attorney\u2014made two arguments\n\nregarding the statute of limitations. Her principal argument was that \u201c\u00a7 9-1-13 [did]\n\nnot apply * * * because [hers was] not a products liability complaint,\u201d nor, for that\n\nmatter, one of negligence, which was the type of case intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nIn the alternative, plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations was tolled until 2019,\n\nwhen she sought legal advice regarding her estate, because only then did she\n\ndiscover that her son\u2019s unamended death certificate might affect her estate planning\n\nin Cape Verde. As support, plaintiff cited Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291 (R.I.\n\n2001), in which this Court held that, \u201c[i]n some \u2018narrowly circumscribed factual\n\nsituations,\u2019 * * * when the fact of the injury is unknown to the plaintiff when it\n\noccurs, the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled and will not begin to run\n\nuntil, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the plaintiff should have discovered the\n\ninjury or some injury-causing wrongful conduct.\u201d Martin, 784 A.2d at 299 (quoting\n\nRenaud v. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, 662 A.2d 711, 714 (R.I. 1995)).                  This\n\nexception is known as the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d See Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994,\n\n1005-06 (R.I. 2012).\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f      In contrast to intervenor in her motion, plaintiff discussed \u00a7 9-1-13 in her\n\nmemorandum without reference to subsection (a). In her reply, intervenor observed\n\nthat, while subsection (b) provides a special rule for the statute of limitations in\n\nproducts-liability cases, subsection (a) provides the general rule for \u201call civil\n\nactions\u201d and thus governed plaintiff\u2019s claim. She disregarded plaintiff\u2019s attempt to\n\ndistinguish her claim from the negligence cases that intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nAs for plaintiff\u2019s invocation of Martin, intervenor contended that the discovery rule\n\ndid not apply because the record indicated that, \u201cas far back as 2008,\u201d plaintiff knew\n\nor should have known that her son\u2019s death certificate referred to intervenor as his\n\nspouse and, furthermore, that this might have legal implications regarding the assets\n\nto which he was entitled.\n\n                            Second Round of Motions\n\n      The Superior Court did not render a decision on either of intervenor\u2019s 2019\n\nmotions. Almost three years later, in July 2022, intervenor filed a second set of\n\nmotions, which this time included a motion for summary judgment. Again, in her\n\nmemorandum in support of her motion for judgment on the pleadings, Costa argued\n\nthat plaintiff lacked a viable cause of action because the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations\u2014set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\u2014had expired. According to intervenor, \u201c[t]he\n\npleadings ma[d]e it clear that [plaintiff] was aware of the alleged wrongdoing and\n\nfailed to pursue it.\u201d\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f      In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion, plaintiff focused on\n\nthe discovery-rule exception and dropped the argument that \u00a7 9-1-13 did not apply.\n\nIndeed, this time she referred explicitly to \u00a7 9-1-13(a). The intervenor\u2019s reply,\n\nhowever, both invoked and refuted plaintiff\u2019s earlier argument that the statute was\n\nlimited to products-liability cases and was therefore inapplicable.\n\n                           Summary-Judgment Hearing\n\n      The parties came before the Superior Court on October 25, 2022, for a hearing\n\non intervenor\u2019s motions. The hearing justice noted that he had \u201cread everything,\u201d\n\nbut he asked the parties whether they had \u201canything to add to what [they] filed[.]\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff raised two arguments that did not appear in her memoranda. First,\n\nplaintiff revived the argument, albeit in passing, that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) is \u201ca products\n\nliability statute, and I don\u2019t think it applies * * *.\u201d Second, she argued that, even if\n\nthe statute applied, her alleged injury occurred in 2010 at the close of the probate\n\nproceedings\u2014when she assumed her son\u2019s death certificate had been corrected\u2014\n\nand not in 2008; therefore, the ten-year statute of limitations had not expired when\n\nshe filed her complaint in 2019.\n\n      Following plaintiff\u2019s arguments, the hearing justice announced his decision\n\nfrom the bench. To begin, having notified the parties the previous day of his\n\nintentions, the hearing justice converted intervenor\u2019s several motions into a single\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmotion for summary judgment. The hearing justice made this decision because the\n\nparties\u2019 filings relied on material outside the scope of the pleadings.\n\n      The hearing justice next considered intervenor\u2019s argument that plaintiff lacked\n\na viable cause of action because the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\n\nAfter finding that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applied to plaintiff\u2019s claim, the hearing justice stated\n\nthat the \u201cparties do not dispute the facts pertinent to the statute of limitations\n\nanalysis.\u201d According to the hearing justice, plaintiff did not dispute, and had even\n\nconceded, not only that she was aware of intervenor\u2019s \u201callegedly wrongful conduct\u201d\n\nin 2008, but also \u201cthat she assumed that all issues related to her son and the Death\n\nCertificate had been resolved in the Probate Court such that she did not pursue\n\ncorrection of the Death Certificate after the estate was closed.\u201d The hearing justice\n\nconcluded that the statute-of-limitations issue therefore presented a question of law,\n\nbecause there were \u201cno predicate facts to be determined by a fact finder[.]\u201d\n\n      From there, the hearing justice examined plaintiff\u2019s contention that her claim\n\nwarranted an exception to the statute of limitations under the discovery rule; he\n\nconcluded that it did not. \u201c[T]he first problem,\u201d he explained, was that plaintiff\n\nknew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named intervenor as his spouse, which\n\na reasonable person should have known could affect the administration of her son\u2019s\n\nestate and her estate as well. The hearing justice also noted that plaintiff \u201cwas\n\ndirectly involved in the probate proceedings * * * and sought to establish that\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f[i]ntervenor was not legally married to [Da Cruz] to prevent [i]ntervenor from\n\nbecoming a beneficiary of [his] estate.\u201d According to the hearing justice, this made\n\nunreasonable her assumption that the proceedings resolved all issues concerning her\n\nson\u2019s death certificate, thus undercutting the second argument that she made at the\n\nhearing but not in her memoranda. Finally, the hearing justice noted that \u201cthe Rhode\n\nIsland Probate Court is not vested with the jurisdiction to declare legal relations\n\nbetween individuals,\u201d thereby making plaintiff\u2019s assumption even less reasonable.\n\n(Citing G.L. 1956 \u00a7 8-9-9.) In the exercise of reasonable diligence, the hearing\n\njustice concluded, plaintiff should have discovered her alleged injury in 2008, and\n\nso the statute of limitations had not been tolled. He therefore granted intervenor\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n        The Superior Court entered final judgment in favor of intervenor on December\n\n1, 2022. The plaintiff filed a premature but valid notice of appeal on November 21,\n\n2022.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n        \u201cThis Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,\n\nemploying the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.\u201d Apex\n\nDevelopment Company, LLC v. Rhode Island Department of Transportation, 291\n\nA.3d 995, 998 (R.I. 2023) (quoting Nelson v. Allstate Insurance Company, 228 A.3d\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f983, 984-85 (R.I. 2020)). \u201cWe will affirm a trial court\u2019s decision only if, after\n\nreviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id. (quoting Nelson, 228 A.3d at\n\n985). \u201cFurthermore, the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent\n\nevidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere\n\nallegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.\u201d Id.\n\n(quoting Nelson, 228 A.3d at 985).\n\n                                           III\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n      The plaintiff raises only one argument on appeal. As before, she contends that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) does not apply, but now her argument is that, although \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\nprovides a general rule for \u201call civil actions,\u201d the complaint she filed in Superior\n\nCourt is not a civil action. The plaintiff points instead to a different statute, codified\n\nat G.L. 1956 \u00a7 23-3-21, which governs the correction and amendment of vital\n\nrecords. According to plaintiff, this separate statute controls her claim, and because\n\nit does not provide for a limitations period, the filing of her complaint was never\n\ntime constrained. Because plaintiff did not raise this argument in Superior Court,\n\nhowever, it has not been preserved for appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\f      \u201cAccording to this Court\u2019s well settled raise-or-waive rule, issues not properly\n\npresented before the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d\n\nDonnelly Real Estate, LLC v. John Crane Inc., 291 A.3d 987, 994 (R.I. 2023)\n\n(quoting Borgo v. Narragansett Electric Company, 275 A.3d 567, 576-77 (R.I.\n\n2022)).   Here, plaintiff\u2019s specific argument on appeal regarding the statute\u2019s\n\napplication is not the argument she made in Superior Court. In other words, plaintiff\n\n\u201cadvance[d] a new theory on appeal [that] was not raised before the trial court.\u201d State\n\nv. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). She has therefore waived this argument\n\non appeal.\n\n      Even if plaintiff had not waived this argument, however, we would hold that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies to her claim. Section 23-3-21 governs the correction of vital\n\nrecords, which plaintiff has sought with respect to her son\u2019s death certificate.\n\nAlthough the statute lacks a discrete limitations period for making requests to amend\n\nvital records, the State Registrar for Vital Records may not grant certain requests\n\nwithout a court order. See \u00a7 23-3-21.5 The plaintiff concedes that hers is one such\n\nrequest. Nonetheless, she argues that \u201c\u00a7 23-3-21 is a bureaucratic mistake correction\n\nstatute and cannot be controlled by any statute of limitations[,]\u201d and therefore it does\n\nnot matter when she filed her complaint in Superior Court.\n\n\n\n5\n  Regulations provide that the State Registrar for Vital Records has the sole power\nto amend vital records. 216 RICR 10-10-1.37(A).\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f      In certain cases, \u00a7 23-3-21 might operate to correct \u201cbureaucratic mistake[s],\u201d\n\nsuch as transcription errors, misspellings, and the like. The plaintiff\u2019s case, however,\n\nis not one of them. At the heart of plaintiff\u2019s request to correct her son\u2019s death\n\ncertificate is not some minor typographical error, but rather an allegation of fraud,\n\nwhich the state registrar, as a \u201cministerial officer, possessing limited discretion,\u201d\n\nlacks power to adjudicate. Souza v. O\u2019Hara, 121 R.I. 88, 92, 395 A.2d 1060, 1062\n\n(1978). Furthermore, intervenor has a clear interest in the subject of plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncomplaint, that is, whether she is recognized by this state as the surviving spouse of\n\nOrlando A. Da Cruz. Were the state to grant plaintiff the relief she seeks, this would\n\nhave significant implications for intervenor\u2019s legal rights and obligations, to say\n\nnothing of dignitary or emotional harm. Indeed, this is what enabled her to intervene\n\nin this matter to begin with. See Super. R. Civ. P. 24(a).\n\n      It may just be that not all requests to amend vital records are subject to a statute\n\nof limitations, but then again, not all requests to amend vital records require the\n\napplicant to commence a civil action. In 1910, this Court defined \u201c[t]he term \u2018civil\n\naction,\u2019 as used in statutes,\u201d to mean \u201ca proceeding in a court of justice by one party\n\nagainst another for the enforcement or protection of a private right or the redress of\n\na private wrong.\u201d Thrift v. Thrift, 30 R.I. 357, 363, 75 A. 484, 487 (1910). More\n\nrecently, we defined \u201ccivil action,\u201d in the context of another statute, as a \u201cjudicial\n\nproceeding which is commenced by the filing of a complaint and all other required\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fdocuments together with the fees prescribed by law.\u201d Johnson v. Johnson, 264 A.3d\n\n835, 839 (R.I. 2021); see also Super. R. Civ. P. 2 (\u201cThere shall be one (1) form of\n\naction to be known as \u2018civil action.\u2019\u201d). According to either definition, the plaintiff\n\ncommenced a civil action when she filed her complaint in Superior Court to amend\n\nher son\u2019s death certificate. Because the statute of limitations under \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\napplies to \u201call civil actions\u201d unless otherwise provided, and because the legislature\n\nhas not enacted a special rule for requests to amend vital records, \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies\n\nto the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Consequently, we concur with the hearing justice that the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a).\n\n                                           IV\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.\n\nThe papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court.\n\n\n\n      Justice Long did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                          STATE OF RHODE ISLAND\n                                     SUPREME COURT \u2013 CLERK\u2019S OFFICE\n                                           Licht Judicial Complex\n                                             250 Benefit Street\n                                           Providence, RI 02903\n\n\n                                 OPINION COVER SHEET\n\n\nTitle of Case                        In re Orlando A.

Mello, Assistant District Attorney, for the\nCommonwealth.\n\n\n    WOLOHOJIAN, J.     Approximately one month before his\n\neighteenth birthday, the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent for\n\nhaving committed assault and battery on a family or household\n\nmember in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).     At the end of\n\nthe trial, the Commonwealth moved to continue sentencing until\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\nafter the juvenile turned eighteen.   The Juvenile Court judge\n\nallowed the motion after an evidentiary hearing.    She did so on\n\nthe ground that the juvenile's desperate need of aid,\n\nencouragement, and guidance could not be satisfied in the\n\nlimited time before he turned eighteen, and that it was in the\n\njuvenile's best interest to postpone sentencing so that he could\n\nobtain services necessary for his rehabilitation.      The juvenile\n\nhas appealed.\n\n    While the appeal has been pending, the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt decided Noah N. v. Commonwealth, 489 Mass. 498 (2022)\n\n(Noah N.), in which it held that a judge is permitted to allow a\n\ncontinuance beyond a juvenile's eighteenth birthday for the sole\n\npurpose of extending the time of commitment, but only after the\n\njudge conducts an evidentiary hearing and makes express findings\n\nto the effect that the continuance is necessary to ensure the\n\nrehabilitation of the juvenile.   Id. at 502-503.   The court\n\nplaced the burden on the Commonwealth to prove by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that continued commitment is necessary to\n\nensure the juvenile's rehabilitation.    Id. at 503.\n\n    The juvenile argues that Noah N. announced a new rule that\n\nshould not apply retroactively to him.   In the alternative, the\n\njuvenile argues that the requirements of Noah N. were not\n\nsatisfied in this case.   Further, relying on Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) (Apprendi), the juvenile argues that\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nthe framework established in Noah N. violates his rights under\n\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nbecause it permits a judge to extend a sentence merely upon a\n\nshowing by clear and convincing evidence, instead of reserving\n\nthat determination to a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Finally, the juvenile argues that his due process rights\n\nwere violated because the delay in sentencing gave the\n\nCommonwealth a \"tactical advantage.\"    We affirm the adjudication\n\nof delinquency and the order allowing the motion to continue.1\n\n     Background.   On February 4, 2021, approximately four months\n\nbefore the juvenile was to turn eighteen, he was charged with\n\nassault and battery on a family or household member, in\n\nviolation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).   The juvenile and his\n\ncounsel pursued a strategy to have the charge tried before he\n\nturned eighteen to attempt to prevent the judge from sentencing\n\nhim beyond that age.   See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58.   To that end,\n\nbelieving that a bench trial was likely to be scheduled sooner\n\nthan a jury trial, the juvenile waived his right to a jury\n\ntrial.\n\n\n     1 The Commonwealth agrees that this appeal is not moot, even\nthough the juvenile's commitment to the custody of the\nDepartment of Youth Services (DYS) has ended, and he is now over\ntwenty years old. We are of the same view and conclude, for the\nreasons explained in Matter of a Minor, 484 Mass. 295, 299-300\n(2020), that the juvenile has a surviving interest in\nestablishing that the commitment order was not lawfully issued.\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\n     As the juvenile and his counsel hoped, the case was tried\n\nover two days approximately one month before the juvenile's\n\neighteenth birthday.   At the conclusion of the trial, the judge\n\nadjudged the juvenile delinquent.    The juvenile does not\n\nchallenge the adjudication of delinquency on appeal on\n\nevidentiary grounds, and we now recite the facts underlying the\n\nadjudication as the judge found them.2\n\n     In 2018, the juvenile -- six feet, two inches tall and\n\nweighing 210 pounds -- and the victim -- four feet, eleven\n\ninches tall and weighing 118 pounds -- began an intimate\n\nrelationship.   The victim ended the relationship around January\n\n2021, after she discovered that the juvenile had been cheating.\n\nThe following month, on February 3, 2021, the victim went to the\n\njuvenile's home to talk.   After a conversation lasting around\n\nfifteen to twenty minutes, the victim said she wanted to go\n\nhome.    The juvenile grabbed her arm to prevent her from leaving\n\nand threw her onto his bed.    When the victim again attempted to\n\nleave and repeated that she wished to go home, the juvenile\n\nstruck her, causing her to fall back onto the bed.    The juvenile\n\nthen repeatedly punched, slapped, and spit at the victim, who\n\nwent into a fetal position, covering her face with her arms.\n\n\n\n\n     2 The judge made detailed and comprehensive written findings\nof fact in her decision on the motion to continue sentencing,\nand we draw our recitation of the facts from those findings.\n\f                                                                     5\n\n\nDespite the victim's request that he stop, the juvenile\n\ncontinued to beat her while atop her and said, \"[S]hut the fuck\n\nup bitch.\"   Eventually, the juvenile stood up and told the\n\nvictim, \"I fucking love you, don't you fucking get it.\"     When\n\nthe victim then attempted to leave, the juvenile again called\n\nher a \"bitch,\" punched her in the back of the head, and caused\n\nher to fall to her knees.    He then grabbed the victim by the\n\nhair and dragged her through the bedroom.    Eventually, the\n\nvictim was able to leave the juvenile's room and called 911.3\n\nOfficers responded quickly and found the victim crying, with\n\nvisible scratches on her hand and both sides of her neck.      The\n\nvictim was taken to a hospital where she was treated for\n\napproximately three hours.   At the time of the trial, she\n\ncontinued to suffer long-term injuries from the assault and was\n\nattending ongoing physical therapy twice a week for injury to\n\nher spine and for pain while sitting or walking.\n\n     The juvenile moved for immediate sentencing as soon as the\n\njudge adjudged the juvenile delinquent at the conclusion of the\n\ntrial.   The Commonwealth moved to stay sentencing until after\n\nthe juvenile's eighteenth birthday, a request the juvenile\n\nopposed.   At the beginning of the ensuing evidentiary hearing,\n\nbefore she allowed extensive argument from counsel, the judge\n\n\n     3 Members of the juvenile's family attempted to interfere\nwith the victim's 911 call.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nstated that she was inclined to allow the motion and explained\n\nher reasoning as follows:\n\n     \"So when I think about what transpired here -- this was a\n     horrific beating that transpired involving an intimate\n     partner of his -- the goals of the juvenile court are to\n     make sure that [the juvenile] receives the treatment\n     necessary in order to make sure that he has the services in\n     place, that he gains insight as to what transpired here, to\n     make sure that he goes on into adulthood he has the\n     capacity, understanding, and ability to control himself and\n     to engage in a safe and appropriate relationship with\n     individuals of the opposite sex.\n\n     \"So I can't imagine that in three weeks, which I think is\n     his -- his birthday is mid-June -- that that's going to be\n     accomplished by sentencing him for a three-week sentence.\"\n\nThe judge also expressly stated that she was \"not looking at\n\npunishment, . . . [but] at engagement in services to make sure\n\nthat [the juvenile] engage[s] in intimate partner abuse\n\nprevention, to make sure he receives the counseling necessary in\n\norder to be able to prevent that type of thing.\"   The judge\n\nrepeated during the course of argument that \"given the time\n\nperiods and the particulars of this case, I don't see that it\n\nis[] reasonable in any way, shape, or form to commit him to\n\n[the] D[epartment of] Y[outh] S[ervices] [DYS] for three weeks.\n\nIt wouldn't even entail the start of services in that time\n\nperiod.\"4\n\n\n\n\n     4 The judge also gave weight to the juvenile's delinquency\nrecord as well as to the fact that the juvenile had violated\nprobation in the past and was therefore not a good candidate for\nprobation. The judge also considered that, even if probation\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\n    Counsel for the juvenile then asked to call a witness from\n\nDYS and to present additional evidence.   The judge allowed both\n\nrequests.   Prior to the introduction of this evidence, the judge\n\npermitted the victim to make a victim impact statement.    The\n\nvictim laid out the details of the assault and its continuing\n\npsychological and physical effects.   The judge then repeated the\n\nbasis for her ruling to continue sentencing:\n\n    \"So again, as I stated, taking into consideration the\n    nature and circumstances of this offense, the victim impact\n    statement, the juvenile's delinquency record which, as I\n    indicated, includes a continuation without a finding and a\n    commitment to DYS for similar offenses, assault and battery\n    type violent offenses, the lack of success that he has had\n    on probation, and the concerns the [c]ourt has in not\n    addressing the violence that has been on display here for\n    the past two days,[5] I didn't think it serves his interests\n    or meets the needs and interest of the [J]uvenile [C]ourt\n    in committing him for three weeks.\"\n\nThe juvenile then presented additional evidence, including the\n\ntestimony of the juvenile's DYS caseworker.    The caseworker, who\n\nhad worked with the juvenile for three years, testified that the\n\njuvenile would benefit from additional DYS services, including\n\nindividual therapy, prosocial activities in the community, and\n\nfamily work.   He also testified that, should the juvenile be\n\n\n\nwere available, a one-month probation would not allow sufficient\nservices to rehabilitate the juvenile.\n\n    5  The judge was apparently referring to the testimonial\nevidence of violence during the assault on the victim. The\nrecord does not suggest that there was violence on display in\nthe courthouse during the trial.\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\ncommitted to DYS custody after he turned eighteen, he would be\n\nreleased to the community with services after three to five\n\nmonths.6\n\n     After further discussion of issues that are not implicated\n\nin this appeal, the judge then allowed the Commonwealth's motion\n\nand continued sentencing to the day after the juvenile was to\n\nturn eighteen.     The judge subsequently issued a detailed written\n\nmemorandum of decision containing a nuanced analysis of the\n\nissue and explained, among other things, that her\n\n     \"paramount concern [wa]s that the [j]uvenile in this matter\n     is in desperate need of aid, encouragement, and guidance.\n     The purpose of committing a [j]uvenile after a finding of\n     delinquency is not only correction, but the redemption to\n     society of the offending child. These goals cannot be\n     satisfied within the narrow window of time between when the\n     juvenile was adjudicated delinquent and when he turns\n     eighteen. Therefore, it would not be in the 'best\n     interest' of the [j]uvenile here to move forward with\n     sentencing that would fail to adequately 'encourag[e] and\n     help[ ] [him] to become [a] law-abiding and productive\n     member[ ] of society.'\" (Quotation and citations omitted.)\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Magnus M., 461 Mass. 459, 461, 466 (2012).\n\n     Sentencing occurred on June 24, 2021, the day after the\n\njuvenile's eighteenth birthday, and the juvenile was committed\n\nto DYS custody until he turned nineteen.     This appeal followed.\n\n     Discussion.    The juvenile's overarching argument is that\n\nthe judge abused her discretion or committed other error of law\n\n\n     6 The juvenile argues, based on the caseworker's testimony,\nthat should the judge continue sentencing, the juvenile would\nnot receive services until the continued date.\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nby allowing the motion to continue sentencing until after the\n\njuvenile turned eighteen.    Within that overarching argument, the\n\njuvenile makes a number of subsidiary arguments that are in some\n\nform or fashion driven by the Supreme Judicial Court's decision\n\nin Noah N., which was decided after the judge allowed the motion\n\nto continue and while this appeal has been pending.     We\n\naccordingly begin our analysis with Noah N.\n\n      When the juvenile in Noah N. was seventeen years old, he\n\nwas charged in a delinquency complaint with assault and battery\n\non a family or household member.   See Noah N., 489 Mass. at 499.\n\nApproximately one month before he was to turn eighteen, he filed\n\na tender of plea or admission to the charge.    Id.   The\n\nCommonwealth then requested a continuance of the change of plea\n\nhearing \"for the express purpose of delaying the case's\n\ndisposition until after the juvenile's eighteenth birthday.\"\n\nId.   The Juvenile Court judge allowed the Commonwealth's motion,\n\nand accordingly, Noah's eighteenth birthday passed without his\n\nplea being tendered.   Id.   On appeal to the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt, Noah argued that because he had sought to tender a plea\n\nwhen he was seventeen, he should have benefited from the\n\nprovisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., which required\n\nthat any commitment to DYS custody end when he turned eighteen.7\n\n\n      7General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., provides in\nrelevant part:\n\f                                                                     10\n\n\nNoah N., supra at 501.     Noah argued that allowing a continuance\n\nfor the sole purpose of committing him until age nineteen was\n\ncontrary to the statute.     Id.\n\n    The Supreme Judicial Court noted that \u00a7 58 does not\n\nexpressly address continuances, stating,\n\n    \"This is understandable, as continuances are an ordinary\n    aspect of an orderly judicial process. If a case is\n    continued for reasons related to the judicial process and\n    unrelated to extending the time of commitment, then the\n    statutory requirements for extending such time of\n    commitment are clearly met. Allowing continuances for the\n    sole purpose of extending the commitment period are,\n    however, different. Such continuances, if they do not\n    otherwise serve the purposes of the judicial process,\n    intrude on the Legislature's authority to set limits on the\n    time of commitment. Allowing continuances for this reason\n    alone raises the question whether the statutory language\n    regarding disposal of cases is being manipulated to extend\n    the time of commitment beyond what the Legislature\n    intended.\"\n\nNoah N., 489 Mass. at 501.     Accordingly, the court held that\n\n    \"[w]here a request for a continuance has nothing to do with\n    the orderly disposition of the case, but rather is directed\n    at the timing of the juvenile's impending eighteenth\n    birthday, and at extending the time of commitment beyond\n    that ordinarily authorized by statute, the ample discretion\n    allowed Juvenile Court judges is tightly constrained. A\n    continuance may only be allowed in such circumstances if it\n\n\n\n\n    \"If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child on a\n    complaint, the court . . . may commit him [or her] to the\n    custody of [DYS], but the . . . commitment period shall not\n    be for a period longer than until such child attains the\n    age of eighteen, or nineteen in the case of a child whose\n    case is disposed of after he [or she] has attained his [or\n    her] eighteenth birthday or age [twenty] in the case of a\n    child whose case is disposed of after he [or she] has\n    attained his [or her] nineteenth birthday.\"\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\n     is necessary to ensure the rehabilitation of the juvenile\n     and express findings are made to that effect.\"\n\nId. at 502.    The court required that the judge hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing, and that the \"Commonwealth bears the burden\n\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence the necessity of\n\ncontinued commitment to ensure the rehabilitation of the\n\njuvenile.\"    Id. at 503.\n\n     Noah N., as we have already noted, was decided after the\n\njudge in this case allowed the continuance on appeal here.\n\nThere is no doubt that Noah N. announced new rules with respect\n\nto the legal standard for allowing a motion to continue for the\n\nsole purpose of extending the time for which a juvenile may be\n\ncommitted, to the need for an evidentiary hearing before\n\nallowing such a motion, and to the Commonwealth's burden of\n\nproof.8   See Commonwealth v. Sylvain, 466 Mass. 422, 428 (2013),\n\nS.C., 473 Mass. 832 (2016), quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.\n\n\n     8 Prior to Noah N., continuances in delinquency proceedings\nneeded only to be assessed against the requirements of the rules\nof criminal procedure, which permit continuances \"only when\nbased upon cause and only when necessary to insure that the\ninterests of justice are served.\" Mass. R. Crim. P. 10 (a) (1),\n378 Mass. 861 (1979). \"In most cases, 'cause' refers to reasons\nrelated to the orderly processing of cases.\" Noah N., 489 Mass.\nat 502. Rehabilitation, which is the central purpose of\njuvenile justice, could and can satisfy rule 10 (a) (1)'s\nrequirement that an extension be in \"the interests of justice.\"\nId. However, prior to Noah N., there was no requirement that\nthe Commonwealth prove the need for rehabilitation by clear and\nconvincing evidence, or that the judge conduct an evidentiary\nhearing and make express findings regarding the need for\nrehabilitation.\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\n288, 301 (1989) (\"a case announces a new rule when it breaks new\n\nground or imposes a new obligation . . . [or] if the result was\n\nnot dictated by precedent existing at the time the [adjudication\n\nof delinquency] became final\" [emphasis in original]).   Although\n\na new rule does not generally have retroactive application, it\n\nwill apply retroactively to cases -- such as this one -- that\n\nare pending on direct appeal when the new rule is announced.\n\nSee Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 466\n\nMass. 655, 664 (2013), S.C., 471 Mass. 12 (2015).   We\n\naccordingly disagree with the juvenile's argument that Noah N.\n\ndoes not apply retroactively to him.\n\n    Alternatively, the juvenile argues that the requirements of\n\nNoah N. were not satisfied.   We begin by noting that the judge,\n\nwith remarkable prescience, foresaw Noah N.'s core requirement\n\nthat the continuance be necessary for the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation.   Moreover, the judge anticipated and satisfied\n\nNoah N.'s requirements that she conduct an evidentiary hearing\n\nand make detailed findings.   In other words, the central\n\npurpose, thrust, and procedural safeguards of Noah N. were\n\nclearly satisfied.   But the juvenile contends that what happened\n\nhere nonetheless fell short of what was required.   Specifically,\n\nthe juvenile points to the fact that the Commonwealth presented\n\nno evidence during the evidentiary portion of the hearing on the\n\nmotion to continue, and that the judge did not state the\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\nevidentiary standard by which she assessed the juvenile's need\n\nfor rehabilitation.   The juvenile argues that both shortcomings\n\nare fatal.\n\n    As to the first, although Noah N. clearly places the burden\n\non the Commonwealth to prove by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the continuance is necessary for the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation, the opinion does not suggest that trial evidence\n\ncannot be used to meet the Commonwealth's burden.     Nor does Noah\n\nN. stand for the proposition that the Commonwealth must\n\nintroduce evidence of the juvenile's need for rehabilitation\n\ntwice:   once at trial, and again at the time of the evidentiary\n\nhearing on the motion to continue.   The circumstances in Noah N.\n\nwere materially different than those presented here.    In Noah\n\nN., the motion to continue was filed pretrial, no evidentiary\n\nproceeding bearing on the juvenile's need for rehabilitation had\n\nyet occurred during the case and, as a result, there was no\n\nevidence upon which the judge could have made the required\n\nfindings regarding the need for rehabilitation.   Here, by\n\ncontrast, the motion to continue came directly on the heels of a\n\nbench trial during which ample evidence had been introduced to\n\nsupport the required findings regarding the juvenile's need for\n\nrehabilitation.   And, in addition, the judge was the trier of\n\nfact for both the trial and the motion to continue.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\n     As to the second, it is true that the judge did not state\n\nthat she was applying a clear and convincing standard in\n\nassessing the juvenile's need for rehabilitation.9   We have\n\naccordingly considered whether the matter should be remanded,\n\nbecause it is ordinarily for the trial court judge to make such\n\na determination in the first instance -- not us.10   Cf. Adoption\n\nof Eden, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 296 (2015) (\"it is for the trial\n\njudge, not us, to determine in the first instance whether\n\nunfitness has been proven by clear and convincing evidence, and\n\nwhether termination of parental rights is in the best interests\n\nof the children\").   Importantly, the juvenile does not contend\n\nthat any of the judge's extensive and detailed subsidiary\n\nfindings made in connection with the motion to continue is\n\nclearly erroneous.   Nor does the juvenile challenge the\n\nsubsidiary findings underlying the adjudication of delinquency\n\nthat, as a matter of law, were required to be made upon proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.   G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, first par.;\n\nMagnus M., 461 Mass. at 462-463.   In these circumstances, we are\n\nin sufficient position to review whether clear and convincing\n\nevidence supported the judge's ultimate determination that the\n\n\n     9 This is no fault of the judge who, after all, did not have\nthe benefit of Noah N. when acting on the motion to continue.\nSee Noah N., 489 Mass. at 503 n.5.\n\n     10The juvenile does not seek a remand, which he views as an\nempty exercise since he has already turned twenty.\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\njuvenile was in need of rehabilitation.   Cf. Doe, Sex Offender\n\nRegistry Bd. No. 496501 v. Sex Offender Registry Bd., 482 Mass.\n\n643, 657 & n.4 (2019) (where requirement of explicit finding on\n\nclear and convincing evidence not created until after\n\nadministrative decision, court retains discretion to determine\n\nwhether factual record is sufficiently clear that remand to\n\napply heightened burden of proof is unnecessary).\n\n    \"Proof by clear and convincing evidence is 'not without\n\nteeth[,]' . . . [and] [t]he evidence must be sufficient to\n\nconvey a 'high degree of probability' that the contested\n\nproposition is true.\"   Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 380316\n\nv. Sex Offender Registry Bd., 473 Mass. 297, 309 (2015), quoting\n\nCallahan v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 372 Mass. 582, 588\n\nn.3 (1977).   This \"means that '[t]he requisite proof must be\n\nstrong and positive; it must be \"full, clear and decisive.\"'\"\n\nAdoption of Chad, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 828, 838 (2019), quoting\n\nAdoption of Iris, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 105 (1997).     Without\n\nrepeating the judge's findings, which we have already set out,\n\nthe standard was easily met here.\n\n    The juvenile next argues that the Noah N. framework\n\nconflicts with the requirements of Apprendi, and violates his\n\nrights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because it permits a\n\njudge to extend a sentence merely upon a showing by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, instead of reserving that determination to\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\na jury upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.     Apprendi holds\n\nthat \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\"    Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.   See\n\nCommonwealth v. Denehy, 466 Mass. 723, 736 (2014), quoting\n\nAlleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99, 112, 114-115 (2013)\n\n(Apprendi applies to \"any fact that aggravates the punishment,\n\neither by raising the floor or the ceiling, such that 'the fact\n\n. . . alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a\n\ncriminal defendant is exposed'\").    Cf. Lazlo L. v. Commonwealth,\n\n482 Mass. 325, 330 (2019) (\"a deprivation of liberty imposed by\n\nthe State as a direct consequence of being found delinquent for\n\nhaving committed an offense necessarily includes an element of\n\npunishment\"); Commonwealth v. Quincy Q., 434 Mass. 859, 864-865\n\n(2001) (acknowledging that, under Apprendi, any fact necessary\n\nto increase delinquent juvenile's penalty beyond statutory\n\nmaximum commitment to DYS must be proved to jury beyond\n\nreasonable doubt).     \"The 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi\n\npurposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on\n\nthe basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted\n\nby the defendant.\"     Southern Union Co. v. United States, 567\n\nU.S. 343, 348 (2012), quoting Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.\n\n296, 303 (2004).\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\n     Here, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, limited the seventeen year old\n\njuvenile's potential sentence to a maximum commitment to DYS\n\ncustody to age eighteen.   Noah N., however, permits a judge to\n\nallow a continuance for the sole purpose of committing a\n\njuvenile beyond the statutory maximum if the judge finds, upon\n\nclear and convincing proof, that a longer period of commitment\n\nis necessary for the juvenile's rehabilitation.   The juvenile's\n\nneed for rehabilitation is not a fact reflected in the\n\nadjudication of delinquency for assault and battery on a\n\nhousehold or family member.   It follows, the juvenile argues,\n\nthat the framework established in Noah N. is in conflict with\n\nApprendi because the juvenile's need for rehabilitation should\n\nhave been determined by a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.11\n\n     Whatever merit this interesting argument may have, it is\n\nnot for us to decide it.   \"[W]e have no power to alter, overrule\n\nor decline to follow the holding of cases the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt has decided.\"   Commonwealth v. Dube, 59 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n476, 485 (2003).   It is for the Supreme Judicial Court to\n\n\n\n\n     11The juvenile does not attempt to explain what\nsignificance, if any, his waiver of trial by jury has on this\nargument. Nor does it appear he has considered whether\nrequiring a jury trial on the question of rehabilitation could\nresult in delay beyond the juvenile's eighteenth birthday itself\naffecting the juvenile's potential sentence.\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\ndetermine whether Noah N. is in irreconcilable tension with\n\nApprendi, not us.12\n\n     Finally, the juvenile argues that the continuance gave the\n\nCommonwealth a tactical advantage in violation of his due\n\nprocess rights.   The main weakness in this argument is that the\n\njuvenile fails to articulate what tactical advantage the\n\nCommonwealth obtained from the continuance.   Cf. Commonwealth v.\n\nImbruglia, 377 Mass. 682, 691 (1979) (pretrial delay\n\nintentionally undertaken to gain tactical advantage is\n\nimpermissible).   The case had already been tried, and the judge\n\nhad already adjudged the juvenile delinquent before the\n\nCommonwealth moved for a continuance.   Furthermore, the juvenile\n\nmisapprehends the purpose of the continuance, which was not to\n\nadvantage the Commonwealth but to help ensure the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation.\n\n     There was no error in the order allowing the motion for a\n\ncontinuance.\n\n                                    Judgment affirmed.\n\n                                    Order allowing motion to\n                                      continue sentencing\n                                      affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     12We requested and received the briefs filed in Noah N.,\nand we note that the Supreme Judicial Court does not appear to\nhave been alerted to the potential interplay between Apprendi\nand the standard for allowing a continuance for the sole purpose\nof extending sentence in a delinquency proceeding.\n\f","FOR IMMEDIATE NEWS RELEASE                                                  NEWS RELEASE #003\n\n\nFROM: CLERK OF SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n\nThe Opinions handed down on the 19th day of January, 2024 are as follows:\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n 2023-B-00364             IN RE: WILLIAM M.

MAGEE\n\n\n                ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of\n\nDisciplinary Counsel (\u201cODC\u201d) against respondent, William M. Magee, a suspended\n\nattorney.\n\n\n\n                      PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY\n\n      Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review\n\nrespondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of\n\nlaw in Louisiana in 1978.\n\n      In 2018, we considered a disciplinary proceeding involving respondent\u2019s use\n\nof forged quitclaim deeds to obtain ownership of immovable property in St.\n\nTammany Parish belonging to absentee owners. Respondent did not apprise the trial\n\ncourt of these defective deeds at the time he sought declaratory judgments. For this\n\nmisconduct, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for two years. In re:\n\nMagee, 18-0383 (La. 1\/30\/19), 263 So. 3d 845 (\u201cMagee I\u201d).\n\n      Neither party filed an application for rehearing in Magee I. Accordingly, the\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment became final and effective on February 13, 2019.\n\n      Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at\n\nissue in the instant proceeding.\n\f                            UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n      At the time of the judgment in Magee I, respondent was representing his\n\nlongtime friend, Jerry Dupont, in civil litigation pending in St. Tammany Parish.\n\nState Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dupont Air Conditioning & Heat, Inc., No. 2018-\n\n12767 on the docket of the 22nd JDC, Division \u201cA.\u201d The plaintiff, State Farm,\n\nrepresented by attorney Thomas J. Lutkewitte, filed suit to collect approximately\n\n$14,000 in insurance premiums from Mr. Dupont\u2019s company. On February 7, 2019,\n\nrespondent filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Mr. Dupont. He also\n\nnotified Mr. Lutkewitte of his withdrawal and pending suspension by letter dated the\n\nsame day.\n\n      On February 11, 2019, respondent sent Mr. Lutkewitte a letter via email\n\noffering to settle the Dupont case for $4,000. Another lawyer at Mr. Lutkewitte\u2019s\n\nfirm, Conor Lutkewitte, responded on February 13, 2019 by tendering a counteroffer\n\nof $7,000.\n\n      On February 18, 2019, respondent directed his legal assistant, Marie Clairain-\n\nSavell, to respond to State Farm\u2019s settlement offer with a counteroffer of $5,500.\n\nMs. Clairain-Savell emailed the counteroffer the same day. The signature block on\n\nthe email identified respondent as the author of the email and the corresponding\n\naddress is listed as respondent\u2019s former law office. Opposing counsel did not\n\nrespond to the February 18 email. On February 26, 2019, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent\n\na second email to Conor Lutkewitte asking for a reply to the counteroffer made on\n\nFebruary 18. Again, there was no response to this inquiry.\n\n\n\n                       DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n\n      On February 20, 2019, Thomas Lutkewitte filed a complaint against\n\nrespondent with the ODC. In August 2021, the ODC filed formal charges against\n\nrespondent, alleging that his conduct as set forth above violated Rules 5.5(a)\n\n                                         2\n\f(engaging in the unauthorized practice of law), 5.5(e)(3)(v) (the practice of law\n\nincludes negotiating or transacting any matter for or on behalf of a client with third\n\nparties), and 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct) of the Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct.\n\n       Respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct. He\n\nasserted that his staff\u2019s contact with opposing counsel was \u201cmeant to be completed\n\nbefore the effective date of his suspension\u201d and that \u201cthe short time period thereafter\n\nwhen contact occurred by staff, not Respondent, represents a harmless error.\u201d\n\n       In light of respondent\u2019s answer, the matter proceeded to a formal hearing on\n\nthe merits. Prior to the hearing, the ODC filed a pre-hearing memorandum in which\n\nit suggested that respondent be adjudged guilty of the charged rule violations, but\n\nthat no additional suspension be imposed, inasmuch as respondent had applied for\n\nreinstatement to the practice of law from his suspension in Magee I.1 In his pre-\n\nhearing memorandum, respondent argued that the \u201cisolated incident at issue was not\n\nan unauthorized practice of law,\u201d and therefore that the formal charges should be\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n                                    Formal Hearing\n\n       The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing on February 22, 2022.\n\nBoth respondent and the ODC introduced documentary evidence. The ODC called\n\nthe following witnesses to testify before the hearing committee: Thomas Lutkewitte\n\nand Conor Lutkewitte, State Farm\u2019s counsel in the Dupont case, and Sarah Taylor\n\nBradley, an attorney who leased space in respondent\u2019s law office. Respondent called\n\nhis legal assistant, Marie Clairain-Savell, and his client, Jerry Dupont, to testify; he\n\nalso testified on his own behalf and on cross-examination by the ODC.\n\n\n1\n Respondent filed a petition for reinstatement in July 2021. That proceeding has been stayed\npending the outcome of the instant matter.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                   Hearing Committee Report\n\n        After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nhearing committee made findings of fact, including the following:\n\n        On January 30, 2019, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for\n\ntwo years in Magee I. Respondent and the ODC agreed that February 13, 2019 was\n\nthe last day that respondent could practice law.\n\n        Upon issuance of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent and his legal\n\nassistant began closing his law practice. This included providing notice to clients\n\nand notice to the courts via motions to withdraw.\n\n        At the time of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent was representing\n\nDupont Air Conditioning & Heating Services, LLC in a suit filed by State Farm to\n\nrecover certain insurance premiums. On February 7, 2019, respondent notified his\n\nclient and all counsel in the Dupont case of the suspension order. He also filed an\n\nex parte motion to withdraw as counsel of record, which the trial judge signed on\n\nFebruary 12.2\n\n        On February 7 or shortly thereafter, respondent dictated a letter for Ms.\n\nClairain-Savell to prepare. On February 11, respondent sent the typed letter to\n\nThomas Lutkewitte offering to settle the Dupont case for a payment of $4,000\n\n\u201cwithin one week.\u201d This letter was transmitted through Ms. Clairain-Savell.\n\n        On February 13, the last day that respondent could practice law, Conor\n\nLutkewitte sent an email to respondent at 11:35 a.m. advising that the $4,000 offer\n\nwas rejected and that State Farm would settle for $7,000.\n\n\n\n\n2\n The committee was disturbed that respondent took any action in the Dupont case after he filed\nthe motion to withdraw on February 7, 2019. The committee reasoned that the time between filing\na motion to withdraw and the signing of the order allowing withdrawal \u201cis probably best utilized\nto take minimal steps to protect the client, not take steps that are contrary to the effort to withdraw.\u201d\n[Emphasis in original.] Nevertheless, the committee felt that respondent\u2019s actions taken after\nFebruary 7 but before February 14 were not before it.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f      On February 18, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent the following email to Conor\n\nLutkewitte:\n\n\n              From:              Marie Clairain-Savell [marie@wmageelaw.com]\n              Sent:              Monday, February 18, 2019 2:36 PM\n              To:                'Conor Lutkewitte'\n              Cc:                'William Magee-Business'\n              Subject:           RE: State Farm v.

The committee found this was not plausible, as respondent knew his\n\ndeadline was the same day. No documents, notes, or other emails were supplied in\n\nsupport of this position, and Mr. Dupont was unable to recall the chronology of\n\nevents. The committee found respondent\u2019s account \u201cwas in the nature of a finessed\n\nnarrative instead of simply telling the truth.\u201d\n\n      Ms. Clairain-Savell appeared to be a very diligent and longtime assistant to\n\nrespondent who would promptly attend to her work. She understood that she had to\n\nfollow the lead of the attorney and that she could not negotiate. She testified that\n\nthe substance of the February 18 email was captured by her from an email from\n\nrespondent and that she forwarded it to Conor Lutkewitte at respondent\u2019s direction.\n\nShe had concerns about doing this, but respondent said it was okay since it was\n\ncoming from her.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f      The committee concluded that a rational evaluation of these facts leads to the\n\nconclusion that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont after February 13 to\n\ndiscuss a counteroffer and that respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell an email on\n\nFebruary 18 which she captured in the email that then followed to Conor Lutkewitte.\n\nIf respondent had been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending deadline, he would have called Conor Lutkewitte or sent him an email\n\nimmediately. The committee found these actions by respondent were an effort to\n\ncircumvent the order of suspension in Magee I.\n\n      The February 26 email to Conor Lutkewitte was sent by Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\nwithout direction from respondent.\n\n      Based on these facts, the committee determined that respondent violated the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The committee determined respondent violated duties owed to the public and\n\nthe legal profession. In contravention of his suspension order, respondent knowingly\n\nand intentionally took actions that constitute the practice of law. The committee\n\nnoted that respondent led a client and an employee to believe that it is \u201cokay to do\n\nsomething circuitously that could not be done directly.\u201d The committee commented\n\nthat a lawyer with respondent\u2019s years of experience knows that such conduct is not\n\nacceptable. There was no evidence that respondent\u2019s misconduct caused actual harm\n\nto his client, but there was injury to the profession and the legal system in that\n\nrespondent flouted the rules of the profession in the face of an order of suspension.\n\nBased on the ABA\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee\n\ndetermined the baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The committee determined the following aggravating factors are present: a\n\nprior disciplinary record, deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fto acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, 3 and substantial experience in\n\nthe practice of law. The committee determined the only mitigating factor present is\n\nthe absence of a dishonest or selfish motive.\n\n       Based on these findings, and considering the prior jurisprudence dealing with\n\nsimilar conduct, the committee concluded that respondent\u2019s misconduct involved \u201ca\n\nsingle incident which was undertaken with incredibly poor judgment.\u201d Accordingly,\n\nthe committee recommended respondent be publicly reprimanded and be required to\n\nattend Ethics School. The committee also recommended that respondent be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this proceeding.\n\n       Respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee\u2019s report.\n\n\n\n                          Disciplinary Board Recommendation\n\n       After review, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee\u2019s\n\nfactual findings are not manifestly erroneous and adopted same, with minor\n\nclarifications.\n\n       First, the board clarified that respondent telephoned Mr. Dupont on February\n\n13, 2019 after receiving the email from Conor Lutkewitte; he did not indicate in his\n\ntestimony that he actually met in person with Mr. Dupont on that date. Second, at\n\nthe hearing respondent changed his testimony from his sworn statement concerning\n\nhow he asked Ms. Clairain-Savell to relay Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer to\n\nConor Lutkewitte. At his sworn statement, respondent testified that on February 13,\n\n2019, he dictated instructions to Ms. Clairain-Savell to send what later became the\n\nFebruary 18 email to Conor Lutkewitte. At the hearing, respondent instead asserted\n\nthat he personally told Ms. Clairain-Savell to send the counteroffer by email, and he\n\nassumed this happened on February 13, but was not sure of this date. The board\n\n3\n  The committee was troubled by respondent\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cways he felt he could still\nperform the actions of a lawyer through mediation or through a power of attorney,\u201d and commented\nthat \u201cthese are not tools to practice law without a license.\u201d\n\n                                               7\n\ffound that neither of these clarifications affect the committee\u2019s subsequent findings\n\nthat (1) it was not plausible that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont on\n\nFebruary 13; and (2) it was not plausible that respondent relayed Mr. Dupont\u2019s\n\nsettlement counteroffer to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 13 in order for her to\n\nforward it by email to Conor Lutkewitte. As determined by the committee, had\n\nrespondent been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending suspension, he would have immediately called Conor Lutkewitte or made\n\ncertain that an email was sent to him that day. Moreover, the board noted that while\n\nrespondent asserted at the hearing that he told Ms. Clairain-Savell what information\n\nto include in the February 18 email sent to Conor Lutkewitte, Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\ntestified that she captured the substance of the February 18 email from an email sent\n\nto her by respondent, and she then sent it to Conor Lutkewitte. The board found that\n\nwhile the evidence could support a conclusion that anytime between February 14\n\nthrough February 18 respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email containing Mr.\n\nDupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, the conclusion drawn by the committee that\n\nrespondent sent the email to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 18 is also a permissible\n\nview of the evidence. In a civil context where the fact finder is presented with two\n\npermissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them is not\n\nclearly wrong. Accordingly, the board specifically adopted the committee\u2019s factual\n\nfinding that on February 18, respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email\n\ncontaining Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, which she was directed to forward\n\nto Conor Lutkewitte.\n\n      Based on these factual findings, the board determined respondent\u2019s conduct\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his client and to the\n\nlegal profession. His actions were knowing and intentional. There is no evidence\n\nthat respondent\u2019s conduct caused actual harm to Mr. Dupont, but potential harm to\n\n                                         8\n\fMr. Dupont was present in that had Mr. Lutkewitte negotiated a settlement with\n\nrespondent not knowing he was suspended, the settlement could later have been\n\nquestioned. The profession has been harmed, as respondent has flouted the authority\n\nof the court by practicing while suspended. Based on the ABA\u2019s Standards for\n\nImposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline sanction is\n\nsuspension. The board agreed with the aggravating and mitigating factors found by\n\nthe committee.\n\n      Considering these findings, the court\u2019s prior jurisprudence discussing similar\n\nmisconduct, and the totality of respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board recommended\n\nrespondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, with this suspension\n\nto run consecutively to respondent\u2019s suspension imposed in Magee I. The board\n\nfurther recommended that respondent attend Ethics School and that he be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this matter.\n\n      Respondent filed an objection to the board\u2019s recommendation. Accordingly,\n\nthe case was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, \u00a7\n\n11(G)(1)(b).\n\n\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n      Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La.\n\nConst. art. V, \u00a7 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an\n\nindependent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has\n\nbeen proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re: Banks, 09-1212 (La. 10\/2\/09),\n\n18 So. 3d 57.      While we are not bound in any way by the findings and\n\nrecommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the\n\nmanifest error standard is applicable to the committee\u2019s factual findings. See In re:\n\nCaulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11\/25\/96), 683 So. 2d 714; In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La.\n\n3\/11\/94), 633 So. 2d 150.\n\n                                          9\n\f      The record establishes by clear and convincing evidence that on February 18,\n\n2019, respondent directed his legal assistant to send a settlement counteroffer to\n\nopposing counsel. As this conduct occurred after the effective date of respondent\u2019s\n\nsuspension in Magee I, it constitutes the unauthorized practice of law and therefore\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges.\n\n      Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a\n\ndetermination of the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s actions. In determining\n\na sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain\n\nhigh standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession,\n\nand deter future misconduct. Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Reis, 513 So. 2d 1173\n\n(La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and\n\nthe seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d 520\n\n(La. 1984).\n\n      Respondent violated duties owed to his client and the legal profession. His\n\nactions were knowing and intentional, causing actual and potential harm. The\n\napplicable baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The following aggravating factors are present: a prior disciplinary record,\n\ndeceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the\n\nwrongful nature of the conduct, and substantial experience in the practice of law.\n\n      However, the record also supports a finding of significant mitigating factors.\n\nIn addition to respondent\u2019s lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, we place emphasis\n\non the mitigating effect of the ODC\u2019s considerable delay in instituting disciplinary\n\ncharges in this matter. The record reveals the ODC became aware of the misconduct\n\nin early 2019 when it received the complaint from Mr. Lutkewitte, but did not\n\ninstitute formal charges until August 2021. Notably, these charges were filed\n\napproximately one month after respondent filed an application for reinstatement\n\n                                          10\n\ffrom his suspension in Magee I, and the ODC relied on these charges as a basis to\n\nseek and obtain a stay from the hearing committee considering respondent\u2019s\n\napplication for reinstatement.\n\n      We have recognized that \u201c[s]ome delay in disciplinary proceedings is inherent\n\nin the process.\u201d Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Causey, 393 So. 2d 88, 93 (La. 1980).\n\nHowever, when the delay results in prejudice to the respondent, it may be considered\n\na mitigating factor which bears on the severity of the discipline to be imposed. See\n\nIn re: Huddleston, 595 So. 2d 1141, 1148 (La. 1992). While we do not find sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to conclude the ODC\u2019s delay in instituting charges was\n\nintentional, we believe the timing caused prejudice to respondent by delaying his\n\nability to seek reinstatement from his earlier suspension.\n\n      Under these specific facts, any additional period of suspension would be\n\nunduly punitive. We find respondent\u2019s misconduct is adequately addressed by a\n\npublic reprimand.\n\n      In light of this sanction, we find there is no reason for any further delay in the\n\nconsideration of respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement. Accordingly, without\n\nexpressing any opinion on the merits of the application for reinstatement, we\n\nexercise our plenary original jurisdiction to direct the hearing committee to lift its\n\nstay and consider the application for reinstatement in an expeditious manner.\n\n\n\n                                      DECREE\n\n      Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee\n\nand the disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it\n\nis ordered that William M. Magee, Louisiana Bar Roll number 8859, be and he\n\nhereby is publicly reprimanded. It is further ordered that any stay of consideration\n\nof respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement from his prior suspension be\n\nimmediately lifted.   All costs and expenses in the matter of this disciplinary\n\n                                          11\n\fproceeding are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule\n\nXIX, \u00a7 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of\n\nthis court\u2019s judgment until paid.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f","                          NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 126,107\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                           ERIC S. CLARK,\n                                             Appellant,\n\n                                                   v.\n\n                      CITY OF WILLIAMSBURG, KANSAS, RALPH STOVER\n                            in his official capacity as Mayor of the\n                              CITY OF WILLIAMSBURG, KANSAS,\n                        and RALPH STOVER, in his individual capacity,\n                                            Appellees.\n\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Appeal from Franklin District Court; ERIC W. GODDERZ, judge. Submitted without oral\nargument. Opinion filed January 19, 2024. Affirmed.\n\n\n       Eric S. Clark, appellant pro se.\n\n\n       J. Steven Pigg, of Fisher, Patterson, Sayler & Smith, L.L.P., of Topeka, for appellees.\n\n\nBefore COBLE, P.J., MALONE and WARNER, JJ.\n\n       WARNER, J.: Eric Clark filed this lawsuit against the City of Williamsburg and its\nmayor, Ralph Stover, to determine who owns land next to a road in Williamsburg. The\ndistrict court eventually granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that the\nCity\u2014and not Clark\u2014owned the property. Clark appeals. After carefully considering the\nparties' arguments and the record before us, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The central question in this case is who owns two tracts of land adjacent to Dane\nAvenue, which was formerly Kansas Highway 273 (or K-273), in Williamsburg. In 1970\nand 1972, Darreld and Helen Goodwill deeded two plots of land\u2014consisting of .23 acres\nand .26 acres, respectively\u2014to the Kansas Highway Commission. Each deed, titled a\n\"Deed for Highway Purposes,\" transferred \"fee simple\" rights to the land to the\nCommission but retained interests in the oil, gas, and mineral rights.\n\n\n       In September 2002, the City of Williamsburg annexed all of K-273 in Franklin\nCounty from the State. Later that month, the Secretary of Transportation adopted a\nresolution removing K-273 from the state highway system, stating \"the existing road shall\nrevert to local public authority.\" And in November 2002, the State issued a quitclaim\ndeed to the City for various tracts of land in Franklin County. This deed explicitly\nreferenced the .26 acres of land transferred to the State in 1972 by the Goodwills but did\nnot mention the .23 acres transferred in 1970.\n\n\n       Meanwhile, the Goodwills sold their remaining property. In 2003, Clark bought\nthat remaining property from the Goodwills' successors in interest. Clark's deed stated\nthat he was receiving the land that used to belong to the Goodwills \"except [for the] land\ndeeded for highway [purposes].\"\n\n\n       In June 2020, the City's mayor, Stover, was mowing grass next to Dane Avenue in\nWilliamsburg on land Clark believed was his. Stover apparently damaged trees, flowers,\nand electrical supply lines. Clark asked city officials to acknowledge that he owned the\nland, and when they refused, he filed this quiet-title action to determine the land's\nownership.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       In the lawsuit, Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the two tracts\nand that the City only held a 20-foot easement from the centerline of Dane Avenue. He\nalso sought damages for the harm Stover caused when he mowed the land. The City\nresponded that it owned the two tracts of land in fee simple. It asserted that it had\nacquired the land from the State when the State removed the K-273 from the state\nhighway system and issued the quitclaim deed to the City. The City also argued that if it\ndid indeed only hold an easement on the land, the easement ran 30 feet from the\ncenterline of Dane Avenue, not 20 feet like Clark claimed.\n\n\n       The case proceeded through discovery, and both parties eventually moved for\nsummary judgment. Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the land and\ndamages for a trespass against chattels claim against Stover, and the City sought the\nopposite\u2014a declaratory judgment that it owned the land and a dismissal of all Clark's\nother claims.\n\n\n       The district court held a hearing on the opposing motions. At the hearing, Clark\nsuggested that the district court only decide who owned the land and allow him to appeal\nthat ruling, leaving the trespass question for another day. The City did not oppose this\nprocedure.\n\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment for the City. The court found that the\nCity, and not Clark, owned the two tracts of land in fee simple, though Clark retained the\nmineral rights (a matter neither party contested). The court also found that the City had a\n30-foot right-of-way on either side of the centerline of Dane Avenue. The court reserved\nruling on Clark's trespass claim. Clark appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n        Clark challenges both rulings by the district court. He claims the court erred when\nit found that the City, not Clark, owns the two tracts of land adjacent to Dane Avenue.\nAnd he asserts that the court erred when it found that the City had a 30-foot right-of-way,\nnot a 20-foot right-of-way, from the centerline of Dane Avenue. The City urges us to\naffirm both rulings.\n\n\n        We note that although the parties and the district court treated these questions\nindependently, they are in essence swallowed by Clark's quiet-title claim. The two tracts\nof land\u2014which we refer to as the 1970 tract and the 1972 tract\u2014are adjacent to the road\nand thus include the contested right-of-way. The extent of the City's right-of-way would\nonly become important if we were to conclude that Clark owned the 1970 or 1972 tract.\nBut we agree with the district court that Clark does not own that property; the Goodwills\ntransferred that property in fee simple to the State more than 50 years ago. Thus, the\nGoodwills and their successors could not have transferred that same property to Clark in\n2003. As we explain more fully below, we affirm the court's judgment in favor of the\nCity.\n\n\n   1. This court has jurisdiction to consider Clark's appeal.\n\n        Before considering the merits of the parties' arguments, we pause to address a\nprocedural question concerning our authority to hear this appeal. As we have indicated,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to the City on most of the claims in the case\n(those relating to the ownership of the property and the extent of the City's right-of-way),\nbut it did not rule on Clark's trespass claim. The court's journal entry of judgment\ncertified the ownership and right-of-way decisions for interlocutory appeal under K.S.A.\n60-2102(c). Clark, however, did not file an application for interlocutory appeal with this\ncourt within 14 days, as that provision requires. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 60-2102(c).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fInstead, he filed a notice of appeal with the district court and docketed the appeal with the\nCourt of Appeals in the ordinary fashion a few weeks later.\n\n\n       Most cases that come before us in this manner are final judgments\u2014judgments\nthat dispose entirely of the merits of the claims in a case\u2014appealable under K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 60-2102(a)(4). Accord Honeycutt v. City of Wichita, 251 Kan. 451, Syl. \u00b6 1, 836\nP.2d 1128 (1992) (\"A final decision is one that finally decides and disposes of the entire\nmerits of the controversy and reserves no further questions or directions for the future or\nfurther action of the court.\"). This is important because the right to appeal is a statutory\none; Kansas appellate courts only have jurisdiction to hear an appeal if Kansas statutes\nallow it. In re T.S., 308 Kan. 306, 309, 419 P.3d 1159 (2018). Both parties agree that the\ndistrict court's decision that Clark appeals is not a final judgment, as the district court did\nnot rule on Clark's trespass claim. This court thus ordered the parties to brief why this\ncourt has jurisdiction to hear this appeal before the trespass claim has been resolved.\n\n\n       In his response, Clark points out that we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal\nunder K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 60-2102(a)(3)\u2014a statute that allows parties to appeal from \"an\norder involving . . . the title to real estate.\" To invoke this statute, the order affecting real\nestate must have \"some semblance of finality.\" In re Austin, 200 Kan. 92, 94, 435 P.2d 1\n(1967); Cusintz v. Cusintz, 195 Kan. 301, 302, 404 P.2d 164 (1965). We agree with the\nparties that the district court's decision that Clark does not own the two tracts of land in\nquestion carries the finality required to proceed on appeal. We therefore turn to the\ndistrict court's summary-judgment ruling.\n\n\n   2. The district court correctly held that Clark does not own the land in question.\n\n       Clark challenges the district court's ruling that he does not own the 1970 and 1972\ntracts in two main ways. He asserts that the court erred when it found that the Goodwills\ntransferred that land in fee simple; he points out that although the language of the 1970\n\n\n                                                5\n\fand 1972 deeds include phrases Kansas courts have typically found to create fee-simple\ngrants, those deeds state the transfer was \"for Highway Purposes.\" He also points out that\nthe State's quitclaim deed in 2002 made no reference to the 1970 tract; he argues that this,\nat the very least, leaves a factual question as to who owns that property. Kansas caselaw\nundermines both assertions.\n\n\n       Clark first argues that the 1970 and 1972 deeds created a limited transfer for\nhighway purposes. In doing so, Clark acknowledges that the Goodwills transferred some\ninterest in the two tracts of land to the State in 1970 and 1972, and those deeds stated\nthey were transferring the land in fee simple. But he claims the deeds' reference to the\nland's usage for highway purposes limited the nature of the transfer, and ownership of the\nproperty reverted to him (or to his predecessors in interest) when the State ceased using\nK-273 as a state highway in 2002.\n\n\n       The basis for this assertion requires a bit more development. As we have\nmentioned, the 1970 and 1972 deeds from the Goodwills to the State were each titled as a\n\"Deed for Highway Purposes.\" Each deed contained identical operative language, stating\nthe deed transferred the respective tract of land to the State\n\n\n       \"(excepting the oil and gas minerals under or in said lands) . . . together with all and\n       singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtances thereto belonging or in any wise\n       appertaining, forever. It is understood and agreed that [the State] is acquiring said real\n       estate for state highway purposes.\n               \"And [the Goodwills] do hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with [the\n       State] that at delivery of these presents they are lawfully seized of an estate in fee simple\n       in all and singular the above granted and described premises with the appurtenances\n       thereto, except for the right of way of any existing public highway thereon; that the same\n       are free and clear of and from all and every incumbrance whatsoever, . . . and that they\n       will forever warrant and defend the same unto [the State] or its assigns forever, against all\n       and any lawful claim of all and any persons whomsoever.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n\f       Clark correctly points out that the plain language of these deeds indicated that they\nwere transferring the land for highway purposes. He thus argues that the deeds created a\nlimited transfer\u2014a fee simple determinable interest in the land\u2014that would\nautomatically revert to the grantor when a specific condition ceases to occur. So, Clark\ncontends, these tracts automatically reverted to the previous owner of his property in\n2002 when Dane Avenue was no longer used for highway purposes as K-273.\n\n\n       We disagree. Kansas courts have consistently interpreted similar language in\ndeeds as transferring land in fee simple without any reversion. More than 40 years ago,\nthe Kansas Supreme Court observed that it is \"well settled that the mere expression that\nproperty is to be used for a particular purpose will not in and of itself suffice to turn a fee\nsimple into a determinable fee.\" Roberts v. Rhodes, 231 Kan. 74, 77, 643 P.2d 116\n(1982).\n\n\n       The court's decision in Roberts illustrates this principle. There, previous property\nowners had transferred land to a school district in 1902 and 1908. Both deeds essentially\nstated that the property was being transferred \"'only for school or cemetery purposes.'\"\n231 Kan. at 75. The land was then used for school purposes for more than 60 years, until\nthe school district sold the land in 1971. The successor to the original property owners,\nRoberts, challenged the person who had received title from the school district, Rhodes,\nclaiming the land should revert to Roberts when it ceased being used for school purposes.\n\n\n       On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged the difficulty of interpreting\nthese deeds when the parties did not \"provide for what should happen to the land after it\nhas been used for school purposes for sixty years and then is no longer needed for such\npurpose.\" 231 Kan. at 76. But our Supreme Court found that despite the language in the\n1902 and 1908 deeds regarding the intended use of the property, \"neither deed made\nprovision for the estate to revert or terminate\" if the land ceased being used for that\npurpose. 231 Kan. at 76. Without any explicit language indicating a reversion, the court\n\n\n                                               7\n\fheld that the 1902 and 1908 deeds had transferred title in fee simple, not fee simple\ndeterminable. 231 Kan. at 80.\n\n\n       As this discussion highlights, it has long been the law in this state that a deed must\nclearly and explicitly reserve a reversionary interest in the grantor to create a fee simple\ndeterminable interest. Kinney v. State, 238 Kan. 375, 380, 710 P.2d 1290 (1985). The\n1970 and 1972 deeds at issue in this case did not do that. Instead, they transferred the\nland to the State in fee simple without restriction, reserving for the Goodwills only the\noil, gas, and mineral interests. Thus, the district court correctly found that, despite the\nlanguage signifying the Goodwills' present intent, the 1970 and 1972 deeds transferred\nunlimited, fee simple ownership of the two tracts of land to the State.\n\n\n       Clark next asserts that, even if the Goodwills' transfer to the State was not limited\nto using the land as a state highway, the district court erred when it found at summary\njudgment that the City now owns that property. Clark argues that there is a factual\nquestion as to whether the City ever received title to the 1970 tract, as it was not\nexplicitly described in the quitclaim deed the State provided to the City when it\ntransferred the property in 2002.\n\n\n       Quitclaim deeds often are less than precise, and the 2002 quitclaim deed from the\nState to the City here is no different. The 2002 quitclaim deed does indicate that the State\nis transferring all property previously surrounding K-273 in Franklin County to the City.\nThis would appear to include the 1970 tract, which everyone acknowledges abutted the\nhighway. But the parties agree that the 2002 quitclaim deed does not include a legal\ndescription of the 1970 tract in its list of land being transferred.\n\n\n       The problem with Clark's arguments, however, is more fundamental. As we have\nindicated, the district court correctly found that the Goodwills transferred the 1970 and\nthe 1972 tracts of land to the State in fee simple, reserving only the oil, gas, and mineral\n\n\n                                               8\n\frights to the Goodwills and their successors. We thus affirm the district court's ruling that\nClark does not own that property.\n\n\n       There may have been a factual question as to whether the State or the City now\nowns the 1970 tract. But if such a question existed, that dispute would have been between\nthe State and the City. We note that the State has not contested the district court's ruling\nthat the City owns that land. Clark himself, as successor to the Goodwills, may be curious\nas to who owns that property. But he has no legal, cognizable interest in that\ndetermination. Thus, he has no standing to further contest the property's ownership.\nAccord Wood v. Nicolson, 43 Kan. 461, Syl. \u00b6 3, 23 P. 587 (1890) (one must have some\nlegal ownership interest in property before one can pursue a quiet-title action).\n\n\n       We affirm the district court's ruling that the City, and not Clark, owns the 1970\nand 1972 tracts of land in fee simple, though Clark maintains an interest in the oil, gas,\nand mineral rights in that land. In light of this conclusion\u2014that the City owns the land\nnext to Dane Avenue\u2014we need not determine whether the City also possesses a 20-foot\nor 30-foot right-of-way on that land.

Schaffer and Shannon Smith, of Schaffer & Associates, Chartered, of Overland Park, for\nappellee.\n\n\nBefore HILL, P.J., MALONE and ISHERWOOD, JJ.\n\n\n        PER CURIAM: Clara Fuller filed a complaint with the Kansas Insurance\nDepartment alleging that Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (Liberty Mutual) failed to refund\nher the full amount of insurance premiums she was entitled to after her property was\nforeclosed upon. The Department declined to find any fault in Liberty Mutual's actions so\nFuller sought relief in the district court through a civil suit. The district court ultimately\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual. On appeal, Fuller argues the\ndistrict court erred because the burden to cancel the policy was not hers to bear. She also\ncontends the district court arrived at its conclusion by engaging in an ex parte\n\n                                                  1\n\fcommunication which violated her right to due process. We have thoroughly analyzed the\nrecord and failed to find any error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order\ngranting Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Claudine Fuller owned a home in Wyandotte County, Kansas, that was insured\nunder a policy through Liberty Mutual. Claudine died in July 2016, and the home passed\nto her sister, Clara (Fuller). The 12-month homeowner's policy was automatically\nrenewed in November of that year, and, under its terms, Fuller became the insured party.\nThe language of the policy contemplated that should Fuller ever desire to cancel it, she\nwas required to provide written notice of her intent, accompanied by a specific\ncancellation date, to Liberty Mutual. Fuller claimed to have no knowledge of the policy,\nso written notice was never issued to Liberty Mutual. As a result, Liberty Mutual\ncontinued to receive payments through an escrow account with Claudine's mortgage\nprovider, Selene Finance.\n\n\n       In May 2017, Selene Finance notified Liberty Mutual that the property was\npotentially vacant. Several months later, Liberty Mutual verified the vacancy and\ncancelled the policy. Upon receiving notice of the cancellation, Selene Finance informed\nLiberty Mutual that the property was subject to foreclosure four months earlier. Liberty\nMutual then backdated the cancellation date to reflect the foreclosure date and issued a\nprorated premium refund check to Fuller for $556.\n\n\n       Fuller believed she was entitled to a refund encompassing the total amount of\npremiums paid to Liberty Mutual from the time of Claudine's death in July 2016 through\nthe policy's cancellation in September 2017, and filed a complaint with the Kansas\nInsurance Department (the Department) seeking to recover those additional funds. The\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fDepartment investigated the matter and concluded that the amount Fuller received from\nLiberty Mutual was appropriate.\n\n\n       Unsatisfied, Fuller filed a civil suit in the district court and claimed she was\nentitled to a refund totaling $3,354. Liberty Mutual moved for summary judgment and\nasserted that Fuller failed to submit a written cancellation as required by the policy,\ntherefore, she was not entitled to any additional funds. The district court held a hearing\non the motion, after which it granted Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n\n       Fuller now brings the matter to us for a determination of whether the district\ncourt's ruling and the manner it was arrived at were erroneous.\n\n\n                                      LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe district court properly granted Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n       In her first claim of error, Fuller reiterates her contention that she is entitled to a\nrefund for the full amount she requested because it was not her responsibility to ensure\nthe policy got cancelled. Liberty Mutual counters that the plain terms of the policy placed\nthe obligation at Fuller's feet to provide written notice of her intent to cancel the policy\nand she neglected to do so.\n\n\n       We can extrapolate from a broad reading of Fuller's notice of appeal that she seeks\nto appeal the district court's order which granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty\nMutual. But her brief fails to clarify those intentions and the absence of the standard of\nreview used to analyze appeals from an order granting summary judgment further\ncomplicates the matter. We acknowledge that pro se filings are to be liberally construed\nbut, equally true, is the fact that such litigants are not entitled to special treatment when\nthey fail to follow procedural rules. See State v. Redding, 310 Kan. 15, Syl. \u00b6 1, 444 P.3d\n\n\n                                               3\n\f989 (2019). We cannot address arguments not properly before us, nor can we supplement\narguments that are inadequately briefed to bring them up to par. Joritz v. University of\nKansas, 61 Kan. App. 2d 482, 498-99, 505 P.3d 775, rev. denied 315 Kan. 968 (2022).\nWe find that through the exercise of an appropriate degree of liberal construction, the\ncontents of Fuller's brief are adequate to enable us to review her claim.\n\n\n       Appellate courts review the district court's denial of a motion for summary\njudgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\nmotion. If reasonable minds could differ about the conclusions drawn from the\nevidence\u2014meaning, there is a genuine issue about a material fact\u2014then summary\njudgment should be denied. John Doe v. M.J., 315 Kan. 310, 313, 508 P.3d 368 (2022).\nAn issue of fact is not considered genuine unless it has legal force as to the controlling\nissue. In other words, if the disputed fact, however resolved, could not affect the\njudgment, it does not present a \"genuine issue\" for purposes of summary judgment.\nNorthern Natural Gas Co. v. ONEOK Field Services Co., 296 Kan. 906, 934, 296 P.3d\n1106, cert. denied 571 U.S. 826 (2013).\n\n\n       Additionally, the interpretation and legal effect of written instruments are matters\nof law, and we exercise unlimited review when that analysis is required. First Security\nBank v. Buehne, 314 Kan. 507, 510, 501 P.3d 362 (2021). \"'The primary rule for\ninterpreting written contracts is to ascertain the parties' intent. If the terms of the contract\nare clear, the intent of the parties is to be determined from the language of the contract\nwithout applying rules of construction.'\" Russell v. Treanor Investments, 311 Kan. 675,\n680, 466 P.3d 481 (2020).\n\n\n       With those principles as a backdrop, we turn to subsection (5)(a) of the Conditions\nfor Sections I and II of the insurance policy. That provision specifically states: \"[The\ninsured] may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to [Liberty Mutual] or by\nletting [Liberty Mutual] know in writing of the date cancellation is to take effect.\"\n\n                                               4\n\fProbing further into the policy, the language of subsection (5)(b)(3)(b) reflects that\n\"[w]hen this policy has been in effect for 60 days or more, or at any time if it is a renewal\nwith [Liberty Mutual], [Liberty Mutual] may cancel: [i]f the risk has changed\nsubstantially since the policy was issued.\" Finally, subsection (9)(a) provides: \"If any\nperson named in the Declarations or the spouse, if a resident of the same household, dies:\n[Liberty Mutual] insure[s] the legal representative of the deceased but only with respect\nto the premises and property of the deceased covered under the policy at the time of\ndeath.\"\n\n\n       Fuller has failed to satisfy her burden to show that a disputed material fact exists\nwith respect to whether she provided written notice to Liberty Mutual of her intent to\ncancel the policy. Rather, Fuller takes the position that the onus was on Liberty Mutual to\nobtain notice of Claudine's passing through Selene Finance and, upon doing so, to then\ncancel the policy on its own accord. This argument directly contravenes the plain\nlanguage of the policy which clearly states that once Claudine passed away, Fuller\nbecame the insured party by virtue of her status as the executrix of Claudine's estate. In\nother words, her legal representative. As the insured, it was Fuller's responsibility to\nnotify Liberty Mutual that she no longer wished to continue the policy. Fuller's claim that\nshe was unaware of the policy's existence and, correspondingly, her obligation to provide\nnotice of cancellation, does not relieve her of that obligation. Further, Fuller fails to direct\nus to any provision within the policy that automatically makes Liberty Mutual the party\nresponsible for ensuring cancellation occurs upon the death of an insured. Without notice\nof an intent to cancel from Fuller, Liberty Mutual operated in conformity with the\nagreement when it continued to offer coverage and collect premiums until it canceled the\npolicy following foreclosure of the property.\n\n\n       Because the record shows that no genuine issue exists as to whether Fuller failed\nto fulfill her obligation to cancel the policy, as contemplated by its terms and, therefore,\nwas not eligible to receive the refund requested, Liberty Mutual was entitled to judgment\n\n                                               5\n\fas a matter of law. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of\nLiberty Mutual.\n\n\nThe district court did not violate the right to procedural due process that Fuller is\nentitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n       For the first time on appeal, Fuller argues that her due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated because the\ndistrict court held an ex parte hearing. Liberty Mutual responds that no such hearing\noccurred.\n\n\n       Appellate review of an alleged due process violation is a question of law over\nwhich the appellate court has unlimited review. Hemphill v. Kansas Dept. of Revenue,\n270 Kan. 83, 89, 11 P.3d 1165 (2000). \"In reviewing a procedural due process claim, the\ncourt first must determine whether a protected liberty or property interest is involved. If\nso, the court then must determine the nature and extent of the process which is due.\" State\nv. N.R., 314 Kan. 98, 113, 495 P.3d 16 (2021), cert. denied 142 S. Ct. 1678 (2022). A due\nprocess violation exists only if the complaining party shows that he or she was denied a\nspecific procedural protection to which he or she is entitled. In re K.E., 294 Kan. 17, 22,\n272 P.3d 28 (2012). The basic elements of procedural due process are notice and \"the\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\" In re Care &\nTreatment of Ellison, 305 Kan. 519, 526, 385 P.3d 15 (2016).\n\n\n       Fuller has failed to advance a compelling argument which undeniably\ndemonstrates that her claim to recover the insurance premiums involves a protected\nproperty interest as envisioned by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Even if we assume her assertion in this regard is an accurate one, she has\nalso failed to establish how she was denied a specific procedural protection. Ex parte\nhearings are those \"proceedings had at the instance or for the benefit of one side, or of\n\n\n                                              6\n\fone party, only, without notice to or contest by any person adversely affected, or in the\nabsence of opposing parties.\" In re Bowlus' Will, 197 Kan. 351, 357, 416 P.2d 711\n(1966). To show that an ex parte hearing occurred, Fuller directs our attention to the\ndistrict court judge's statements at the hearing that he reviewed the case, but later said\nthat Fuller failed to respond to Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment when\nFuller had, in fact, filed a response. This allegation is insufficient to establish that the\ndistrict court communicated with Liberty Mutual about the case outside the presence of\nFuller, and our review of the record fails to yield any indication that such an exchange or\nhearing occurred. To the contrary, the district court held a hearing on the motion for\nsummary judgment and Fuller was afforded a fair opportunity to argue her position\nbefore the district court.\n\n\n       Because there is no evidence that an ex parte hearing occurred and Fuller received\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the motion for summary judgment,\nher claim that the district court violated her right to procedural due process fails.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f","                         NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 126,085\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                           In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of\n                                       ROBERT DAVIS JR.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n       Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; ROBB W. RUMSEY, judge. Submitted without oral\nargument. Opinion filed January 19, 2024. Affirmed.\n\n\n       Charles Joseph Osborn, of Osborn Law Office, LLC, of Leavenworth, for appellant.\n\n\n       Ryan J. Ott, assistant solicitor general, and Kris W. Kobach, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\n\nBefore WARNER, P.J., ATCHESON, J., and MARY E. CHRISTOPHER, S.J.\n\n       PER CURIAM: Since being confined for treatment as a sexually violent predator in\nDecember 2018, Robert Davis Jr. has annually requested that the Sedgwick County\nDistrict Court order his placement in a transitional living program\u2014the final preparatory\nstep to being conditionally released. He has been denied each time. In this appeal, Davis\nchallenges the district court's denial based on the 2022 report and supplement prepared by\nmembers of the treatment program's clinical staff recommending no change in his\nplacement. We find no error in the district court's ruling and affirm.\n\n\n       By statute, persons held for treatment under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator\nAct, K.S.A. 59-29a01 et seq., are to be clinically evaluated each year and a report of their\nstatus is to be forwarded to the district court that ordered their commitment. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 59-29a08(a). The inmates may petition the appropriate district court for review\n\n                                                        1\n\fhearings to consider whether they should be placed in the transitional release phase of the\ntreatment program. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-29a08(b). The hearing process unfolds in two\nsequential steps. The district court initially determines if the petitioner, here Davis, has\nshown probable cause to believe the mental abnormality triggering his confinement has\nsufficiently changed to warrant placement in transitional release. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-\n29a08(d). If the petitioner makes that showing, the district court must hold a full\nevidentiary hearing at which the State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the petitioner is unfit for transitional release. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-29a08(g).\n\n\n       Here, Davis sought a review hearing for consideration of the 2022 report on his\nstatus, along with a supplemental report. The district court appointed a lawyer to\nrepresent Davis at the probable cause hearing but declined to authorize an independent\nclinical evaluation of Davis. And Davis was not present for the hearing. See K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 59-29a08(c) (The district court may, in its discretion, order an independent clinical\nexamination of an indigent petitioner in advance of the probable cause hearing.); K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 59-29a08(e) (petitioner entitled to legal representation at probable cause\nhearing; but petitioner need not be present).\n\n\n       After reviewing the annual report and related materials and hearing argument from\nthe lawyers for Davis and the State, the district court concluded Davis failed to\ndemonstrate probable cause that his deleterious mental condition had substantially\nimproved. The hearing record established that Davis remained in the first phase of the\nthree-phase treatment protocol for placement in transitional release\u2014the step\nimmediately preceding conditional release and then, ultimately, full release from the\ntreatment program.\n\n\n       The report and supplement showed Davis generally complied with many of the\nprogram requirements and objectives. But the picture was not categorically positive.\nDavis didn't consistently maintain his medication regimen and displayed negative\n\n                                                  2\n\fbehavioral traits as a result. Davis directed angry outbursts at staff and other program\nparticipants. And Davis\u2014in the view of the clinicians preparing the reports\u2014did not deal\nappropriately with a sexual attraction he developed for one of his therapists. The report\nnoted that several actuarial instruments designed to predict the likelihood of recidivism\namong sex offenders placed Davis in what would be considered at least a moderate range\nfor reoffending. The clinicians concluded Davis was appropriately placed in the first\nstage of the treatment program.\n\n\n       In the district court, Davis' lawyer assailed the original commitment proceeding as\nunfair and disputed the effectiveness of the treatment program generally as a genuinely\nrehabilitative process for sex offenders rather than as tool to continue their confinement\nbeyond the prison terms they had already served. Those rhetorical thunderclaps produced\nno legal lightning. They are not germane to the narrow issue relevant in an annual review\nhearing.\n\n\n       The district court declined to order a full evidentiary hearing, effectively denying\nDavis relief. Davis has appealed that ruling.\n\n\n       On appeal, Davis basically argues he satisfied his burden of demonstrating\nprobable cause to believe his mental condition had substantially improved, thereby\nwarranting an evidentiary hearing on his request to be placed in transitional release. We\nowe no particular deference to the district court's conclusion because it rests on\nessentially undisputed evidence and involved no credibility determinations. In re Estate\nof Oroke, 310 Kan. 305, 310, 445 P.3d 742 (2019) (\"Application of legal principles to\nundisputed facts involves questions of law subject to de novo review.\"); In re Care &\nTreatment of Burch, 296 Kan. 215, 223, 291 P.3d 78 (2012) (unlimited appellate review\nof district court's probable cause determination in annual review hearing based on clinical\nreports and lawyers' arguments). We, like the district court, must view the hearing record\nin a light favoring Davis and in support of a probable cause finding. 296 Kan. at 224.\n\n                                                 3\n\f       In this context, \"probable cause\" mirrors the customary definition given the phrase\nin the criminal law: \"[W]hether there is sufficient evidence to cause a person of ordinary\nprudence and action to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief that the committed\nperson's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe\nto be placed in transitional release.\" In re Care & Treatment of Sipe, 44 Kan. App. 2d\n584, 593, 239 P.3d 871 (2010); see In re Care & Treatment of Miles, 47 Kan. App. 2d\n429, 434-35, 276 P.3d 232 (2012) (adopting standard set out in Sipe and noting match\nwith criminal law test for probable cause). Although probable cause is a comparatively\nrelaxed standard, falling well below a preponderance of the evidence, it still requires\nevidence of some substance in support of the proposition to be proved. See State v.\nWalker, 283 Kan. 587, 595, 153 P.3d 1257 (2007) (Substantial evidence is that which\nmight cause a reasonable person to accept a given factual conclusion.).\n\n\n       Having reviewed the hearing record and considering the limited issue before us,\nwe find the district court correctly concluded Davis failed to establish probable cause that\nhe should be placed in the transitional phase of the treatment program. The annual report\nand supplement conclude Davis remains properly placed in the initial treatment phase and\ncite substantial factual bases for the conclusion. Davis failed to adhere to his medication\nregimen, leading to problematic behavior. He apparently failed to deal appropriately with\ncertain sexual urges he felt toward a therapist.

Kobach, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., ATCHESON, J., and TIMOTHY G. LAHEY, S.J.\n\n\n       ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J.: Once a district court pronounces a legal sentence, it\ngenerally loses jurisdiction to modify that sentence except to correct mathematical or\nclerical errors. State v. Johnson, 309 Kan. 992, 996, 441 P.3d 1036 (2019). Costs are not\nconsidered to be part of a defendant's sentence. State v. Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, 34-35, 210\nP.3d 93 (2009). Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) fees are court costs under K.S.A.\n28-176(a)(1). Because KBI fees are not part of the sentence, we find the district court did\nnot lack jurisdiction when it imposed a KBI fee at Joseph Randall Garrison's\nresentencing that it had rejected at his original sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Garrison pleaded guilty to attempted possession of methamphetamine as part of a\nplea agreement. The district court accepted Garrison's plea and eventually sentenced him\nto 34 months in prison.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the district court initially ordered Garrison to pay a $400 KBI lab\nfee. Defense counsel said he did not believe there was a lab fee. The district court\nbelieved the PSI report showed a lab fee but said if there was not a lab fee then it should\nnot be assessed. The prosecutor informed the district court that it did not look like they\n\"ha[d] a lab result back on this one.\" Based on this statement, the district court concluded\nthat the KBI lab fee would not be imposed.\n\n\n       Less than a month after sentencing, and before any journal entry or notice of\nappeal was filed, Garrison moved to correct an illegal sentence. He noted that he was\nsentenced for possession of methamphetamine when his crime of conviction was\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. Under K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1),\n\"[a]n attempt to commit a felony which prescribes a sentence on the drug grid shall\nreduce the prison term prescribed in the drug grid block for an underlying or completed\ncrime by six months.\" Accordingly, he argued, his sentence should have been reduced by\nsix months. The State agreed that Garrison's sentence should be reduced.\n\n\n       The district court granted Garrison's motion and the case proceeded to\nresentencing. The district court reduced Garrison's sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 2021\nSupp. 21-5301(d)(1), resulting in a 28-month prison sentence.\n\n\n       Relevant to this appeal, the $400 KBI lab fee was also discussed. Defense counsel\nstated that he did not believe there was a KBI fee in the case and that it should not be\nimposed. The prosecutor disagreed that there was no KBI fee and stated that she had the\n\n                                              2\n\fKBI lab reports. The prosecutor indicated that she had showed the report to defense\ncounsel, and she believed he agreed regarding the fee. Defense counsel stated his\nagreement by responding, \"Yeah.\" Defense counsel then stated that he did not receive the\nlab report before the original sentencing, so he thought there was not one. The district\ncourt assessed the $400 KBI lab fee and filed a journal entry reflecting the same. See\nK.S.A. 28-176(a).\n\n\n       Garrison appealed.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction to impose the\nKBI lab fee after it had elected not to do so at the initial sentencing.\n\n\n       Whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law, subject to unlimited appellate\nreview. State v. Hillard, 315 Kan. 732, 775, 511 P.3d 883 (2022). Subject matter\njurisdiction may be raised at any time, whether for the first time on appeal or even on the\nappellate court's own motion. State v. Clark, 313 Kan. 556, 560, 486 P.3d 591 (2021).\n\n\n       Generally, the district court retains jurisdiction over a case until an appeal is\ndocketed with the appellate court. State v. Thurber, 313 Kan. 1002, 1006, 492 P.3d 1185\n(2021). The district court's jurisdiction is limited after sentencing, because once the\ndistrict court pronounced a legal sentence, it generally loses jurisdiction to modify that\nsentence except to correct mathematical or clerical errors. State v. Johnson, 309 Kan.\n992, 996, 441 P.3d 1036 (2019).\n\n\n       Although a person's legal sentence cannot be modified after sentencing, costs are\nnot considered to be part of a defendant's sentence. Phillips, 289 Kan. at 34-35\n(explaining that costs are not punitive and therefore are not a part of the sentence\n\n                                               3\n\fimposed in a criminal case). KBI fees are one of the court costs that can be imposed on a\ndefendant under K.S.A. 28-176(a). In fact, K.S.A. 28-176(a) requires a fee be assessed by\nthe court anytime laboratory services are provided as part of the investigation in the case.\nThe court can only lessen or waive such fees if the defendant is indigent, and the court\nmakes such a finding on the record. K.S.A. 28-176(c). So to the extent laboratory\nservices were provided by the KBI, it would have been error for the district court not to\naccess the related fees.\n\n\n       Moreover, Kansas appellate courts have previously held that costs can be assessed\nafter sentencing. For example, in Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, the district court ordered the\ndefendant to pay a docket fee, booking fee, and a Board of Indigents' Defense Services\n(BIDS) application fee. The district court did not announce the imposition of these costs\nat sentencing. Rather, the district court merely included them in the journal entry of\njudgment. The Kansas Supreme Court found that this practice did not violate the rules\nrequiring a district court to announce a defendant's sentence in open court. 289 Kan. at\n40. While the court said that while \"announc[ing]the imposition of costs at the sentencing\nhearing . . . is a preferred practice . . . the failure to do so will not void an order to pay\ncosts.\" 289 Kan. at 45. The court also found that this practice did not violate K.S.A. 22-\n3803\u2014the statute governing taxation of costs in a criminal case. That statute provides\nthat costs \"'shall'\" be taxed \"'[a]t the conclusion of each criminal case.'\" 289 Kan. at 40\n(quoting K.S.A. 22-3803); see also State v. Dean, 12 Kan. App. 2d 321, 325, 743 P.2d 98\n(1987) (approving extradition costs imposed four months after sentencing). We have no\ntrouble finding that the district court had jurisdiction to impose lab fees at the second\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n       Garrison's brief also includes a single sentence in which he asserts that the district\ncourt erred in imposing the lab fee \"because there was no evidence of 'laboratory services'\nhaving been provided by the KBI. See K.S.A. 28-176(a).\" To the extent Garrison is\nchallenging the factual basis supporting the fee or the existence of a lab report, he did not\n\n                                                4\n\fpreserve this issue. Garrison did not object to the KBI lab fee on these grounds at his\nresentencing hearing. In fact, the brief exchange suggests that defense counsel agreed that\nthe fee should be imposed. So Garrison is raising this issue for the first time on appeal.\nGenerally, issues not raised before the district court cannot be raised on appeal. There are\nseveral exceptions to this rule, but Supreme Court Rule 6.02(a)(5) (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at\n36) requires an appellant to explain why this court should consider an issue for the first\ntime on appeal. State v. Williams, 298 Kan. 1075, 1085, 319 P.3d 528 (2014). Garrison\nmakes no such argument here.\n\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm the district court's order assessing $400 in KBI lab\nfees in this case.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n                                            ***\n\n\n       ATCHESON, J., concurring: For his only issue on appeal, Defendant Joseph\nGarrison submits the Leavenworth County District Court improperly ordered him to pay\na statutorily mandated laboratory fee when the district court declined to impose the fee\nduring his sentencing hearing but included it in the journal entry of judgment after\ndiscussing the matter with the prosecutor and his lawyer during a later proceeding. This\ncourt has held the laboratory fee\u2014to be assessed against defendants convicted of\nspecified crimes under K.S.A. 28-176 when the State's investigation requires laboratory\nor forensic services\u2014is an administrative court cost rather than a punitive sanction. State\nv. Likins, 21 Kan. App. 2d 420, 434, 903 P.2d 764 (1995); State v. Robinson, No. 122,251,\n2022 WL 17172086, at *3 (Kan. App. 2022) (unpublished opinion). The Kansas Supreme\nCourt, in turn, has held that a district court need not address, let alone order, the payment\nof statutory costs during a sentencing hearing and may simply include them in the journal\nentry of judgment. State v. Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, 34-35, 40, 210 P.3d 93 (2009)\n\n                                              5\n\f(explaining that costs are not punitive and, therefore, are not part of sentence imposed in\ncriminal case).\n\n\n       Accordingly, a district court has no obligation to \"pronounce\" payment of the\nstandard statutory laboratory fee of $400 during a sentencing hearing and may simply list\nthe fee, among other mandated costs, in the journal entry. See Phillips, 289 Kan. at 40;\nRobinson, 2022 WL 17172086, at *3 (affirming imposition of $400 laboratory fee,\namong other costs, included in journal entry of judgment even though district court did\nnot mention fee at sentencing). That's what effectively happened here. So Garrison's point\nis without merit, and the district court's order should be affirmed on that basis. I,\ntherefore, concur in the result the majority reaches, but I find its path to that conclusion\nunnecessarily rocky.\n\n\n       As part of an agreement with the State, Garrison pleaded guilty to one count of\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. The State dismissed several other charges. At\nthe sentencing hearing in mid-August 2021, the district court ordered Garrison to serve\n34 months in prison on the mistaken assumption that was the presumptive mid-level\nsentence under the guidelines. The district court denied Garrison's request for a\ndispositional departure to probation. During the hearing, the district court asked the\nprosecutor and Garrison's lawyer about the statutory laboratory fee. The lawyers told the\ndistrict court they had not seen a lab report and inferred no testing had been done, so no\nfee should be imposed. The district court, therefore, did not orally order Garrison to pay\nthe $400 fee.\n\n\n       On September 7, 2021, Garrison filed a motion to correct the sentence as illegally\nimposed because convictions for attempted drug felonies carry presumptive sentences six\nmonths shorter than for the completed crimes. See K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1). The\nrecord reflects that a journal entry of judgment had not yet been entered. At a hearing on\nthe motion about a week later, the State agreed that the 34-month sentence was illegal.\n\n                                               6\n\fThe district court granted Garrison's motion, ordered that a corrected presentence\ninvestigation report be prepared, and continued the matter for what it termed\nresentencing.\n\n\n       At the \"resentencing\" hearing on September 15, 2021, the district court again\nconsidered and rejected Garrison's motion for a dispositional departure and then imposed\na lawful guidelines sentence of 28 months in prison. The district court also raised the\nissue of the statutory laboratory fee. The prosecutor informed the district court a lab\nreport had been received, so Garrison should be ordered to pay the fee. After conferring\nwith the prosecutor, Garrison's lawyer agreed there was a lab report and did not object to\nthe fee being assessed. The district court ordered Garrison to pay that fee and other court\ncosts and waived reimbursement of the attorney fees for his appointed lawyer.\n\n\n       A journal entry of judgment that included the $400 laboratory fee was filed on\nSeptember 27, 2021. For some reason, a second journal entry of judgment, also including\nthe $400 laboratory fee and captioned as a journal entry nunc pro tunc, was filed on\nSeptember 23, 2022. Just why the second journal entry was prepared and filed has no\nbearing on this appeal.\n\n\n       Garrison offers a two-fold pitch as to why the district court erred in ordering him\nto pay the $400 laboratory fee. First, Garrison identifies the well-settled rule that when\nthe district court pronounces a lawful sentence from the bench, that sentence cannot later\nbe changed. State v. Hall, 298 Kan. 978, 983, 319 P.3d 506 (2014); State v. Deck, No.\n123,807, 2022 WL 983628, at *6 (Kan. App. 2022) (unpublished opinion), aff'd on other\ngrounds 317 Kan. 101, 525 P.3d 329 (2023). As I have indicated, Garrison would then\nhave us apply the rule to the imposition of the laboratory fee. But that aspect of\nGarrison's argument is plainly foreclosed by Phillips and Likins.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       For his second line of attack, Garrison says the district court should not have\norally ordered the laboratory fee in handling his motion to correct the illegal sentence\noriginally imposed on him for attempted possession of methamphetamine. In this respect,\nGarrison has a point. But it ultimately doesn't get him very far. If a district court grants a\nmotion to correct an illegal sentence, it then has the authority (and, indeed, the duty) to\nimpose a proper sentence. But that is the extent of its authority. See State v. Guder, 293\nKan. 763, 767, 267 P.3d 751 (2012) (when sentence on one conviction is vacated as\nillegal, district court on remand has no authority to modify lawful sentences already\nimposed on other convictions). So granting Garrison's motion did not occasion a new\nsentencing hearing to reconsider and again rule on anything and everything that typically\nwould be disposed of during such a hearing. (The term \"sentencing hearing\" is shorthand\nfor the proceeding following conviction in which the district court imposes punishment\non a defendant. But the district court typically also addresses and resolves various\nnonpunitive matters, including the imposition of court costs, such as the laboratory fee,\nand reimbursement of attorney fees for appointed counsel.)\n\n\n       The district court, therefore, likely erred in orally ordering Garrison to pay the\nlaboratory fee in conjunction with correcting his sentence. And the majority has likely\nstrayed in endorsing the notion that a full \"resentencing\" necessarily follows when the\ndistrict court grants a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The remedy presumably\nshould be confined to correcting the illegality. By the same token, however, the district\ncourt was free to discuss the matter of the laboratory fee with the lawyers while they were\npresent to argue the motion and at the continued hearing where the district court imposed\na corrected sentence.\n\n\n       Because no journal entry of judgment had yet been entered, the district court\nproperly included the laboratory fee, along with other costs, in the journal entry of\njudgment filed just after the hearing. The district court plainly had the authority under\nPhillips and Likins to include the fee in the journal entry whether or not the fee had been\n\n                                               8\n\forally ordered during any earlier hearing. The chronology of the various hearings\nfollowed by the filing of the journal entry of judgment including the laboratory fee\nundermines Garrison's argument for relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f","                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,826\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                    v.\n\n                                        BRIAN CURTIS JESSE,\n                                            Appellant.\n\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Shawnee District Court; BRETT A.

Dunn, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, for appellant.\n\n\n        Jodi Litfin, deputy district attorney, Michael Kagay, district attorney, and Kris W. Kobach,\nattorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., ATCHESON, J., and TIMOTHY G. LAHEY, S.J.\n\n\n        ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J.: Brian Curtis Jesse appeals the district court's decision to\nrevoke his probation and impose the underlying sentence. First, he contests the\nconclusion that he violated probation by committing the offense of interference with law\nenforcement. Second, he argues that his underlying prison sentence violates equal\nprotection principles. After reviewing the issues presented, we affirm the district court's\ndecision to revoke Jesse's probation and impose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Jesse agreed to plead guilty in Shawnee County to one felony count of possession\nof less than one gram of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute. The plea\nagreement anticipated that his criminal history would be an E, which would place Jesse in\na border box on the sentencing grid. The State agreed not to oppose border box findings\nif Jesse could produce evidence to support such findings. The district court accepted\nJesse's plea and ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\n\n       The PSI report reflected that Jesse had a criminal history score of C, because of a\nprior person felony conviction for attempted aggravated burglary in 2015. Jesse moved\nfor a downward dispositional or durational departure. He argued in part that the age and\nnature of his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction justified a departure because\nlegislative changes in 2016 made it so that his underlying conduct\u2014shoplifting from a\nWal-Mart after being banned from the store\u2014would no longer be considered aggravated\nburglary under current law. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-5807; L. 2016, ch. 90, \u00a7 3\n(amending definition of burglary to exclude \"entering into or remaining in a retail or\ncommercial premises at any time that it is open to the public after having received a\npersonal communication from the owner or manager of such premises not to enter such\npremises\"). To support this point Jesse included a copy of the complaint, which showed a\ncharge in 2014 for aggravated burglary based on an alleged shoplifting at Walmart after\nhe had been banned, as described in his motion.\n\n\n       The district court ultimately granted Jesse's motion for a dispositional departure,\nimposing an underlying 42-month prison sentence based on his C criminal history score,\nsuspended for an 18-month probation term. The district court explained that the\n\"strongest reason\" to grant a departure was that his prior conviction would have been\ncharged differently under current law. The district court also stated it would authorize the\ntransfer of Jesse's probation to Clay County because Jesse resided there.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Just three months later, the State moved to revoke Jesse's probation, alleging he\nhad failed to report to his probation officer and that he had committed a new felony\noffense of interference with law enforcement. At the hearing on the motion, the State\ncalled several witnesses and Jesse testified on his own behalf.\n\n\n       As to Jesse's alleged failure to report, his probation officer testified that she was\nassigned to Jesse's case on the day of sentencing. Jesse did not report as required after\nsentencing, so she sent him a letter to his address in Clay Center, directing him to report\nin Shawnee County on June 1, 2022. She received no response, but Jesse met with her in\nperson on the required date\u2014a clear indication that he had received the letter. She\nexplained the standard terms of probation and directed him to return a week later to\ncomplete an assessment, but Jesse failed to report as directed. She sent another letter to\nJesse's address in Clay Center on June 20, 2022, directing him to report on June 27, 2022.\nShe had no further contact with Jesse after that. According to her notes, Jesse's probation\ndid not include a transfer, but he did set a goal \"that he needs to get out of Clay Center.\"\nShe had no record of a transfer of probation to Clay County but said she usually tells her\nprobationers they must report to her before any transfer and that some counties require\ncompletion of a risk assessment for a transfer.\n\n\n       As to the interference with law enforcement charge, Clay Center Police Chief Bill\nRobinson testified that he received a tip on July 20, 2022, that someone resembling Cade\nSchultz\u2014who had an active felony arrest warrant\u2014had ridden his motorcycle into the\ngarage at Jesse's residence. Robinson went there and knocked on the front door while a\ndeputy kept watch at the back door. Two young children answered the door and\nresponded, \"Yes\" when Chief Robinson asked if Schultz was inside. Robinson asked if he\ncould speak to Schultz and the children again responded, \"Yes\" before closing the door.\n\n\n       After waiting a bit, Robinson knocked on the door again and Jesse answered.\nRobinson explained to Jesse that he had received a tip about Schultz and that the children\n\n                                              3\n\fhad just said Schultz was inside. Jesse responded that Schultz and his girlfriend had been\nthere earlier but left before Robinson arrived. Robinson clarified to Jesse that he believed\nhe had probable cause to get a warrant to search the house, so it would be a felony if\nJesse was discovered harboring a fugitive of a felony arrest warrant. Robinson said he\ntold Jesse to send Schultz out or they would obtain a search warrant. Jesse said he\nunderstood and went back inside, closing the door.\n\n\n       Robinson called for additional officers to surround the house, while he went back\nto his office to apply for a search warrant. Once the warrant was granted, he returned to\nJesse's house. As he was walking up to the house, Robinson heard officers yelling that\nSchultz had exited the house and was running. After apprehending Schultz, the officers\narrested Jesse for interference with law enforcement.\n\n\n       Jesse admitted that he last met with his probation officer on June 1, 2022, saying\nhe had no further contact with her after that meeting because he believed his probation\nwas being transferred to Clay County. Jesse denied receiving any other letters after the\nJune 1 meeting. Jesse said he tried to call his probation officer, but she never answered.\nHe did not report in Shawnee County due to not having a valid driver's license to\ntransport himself from Clay Center. Jesse testified that he did not know Schultz was still\npresent when he first spoke with Robinson and only found out after the conversation.\nJesse did not send Schultz outside or tell the officers because Schultz \"wouldn't let [him]\ngo outside.\"\n\n\n       At the end of the hearing, the district court found, based on the evidence\npresented, that Jesse had violated his probation by failing to report and remain law\nabiding. In particular, the district court found Jesse's testimony lacked credibility,\nincluding both in his statements that he believed his probation was being transferred to\nClay County and that he was unaware of Schultz' presence when he first spoke to\nRobinson. The district court found it was \"more likely to believe that the defendant was\n\n                                              4\n\faware of that fact, and closed the door, misinformed the law enforcement officers about\n[Schultz'] presence in the house for the specific purpose of thwarting the execution of\nservice of process.\"\n\n\n       Jesse opposed revocation of probation, but recognized that the district court could\ndo so and order him to serve his underlying sentence without imposing sanctions because\nhe had received a departure sentence. The district court revoked Jesse's probation and\nordered him to serve the underlying prison sentence, based on the two established\nprobation violations.\n\n\n       Jesse timely appeals.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n          THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REVOKING JESSE'S PROBATION\n\n       Typically, the procedure for revoking a defendant's probation requires two distinct\ninquiries by the district court: (1) a factual determination that the offender violated a\ncondition of probation; and (2) a discretionary determination of the appropriate\ndisposition given the established violation. State v. Horton, 308 Kan. 757, 760-61, 423\nP.3d 548 (2018) (citing State v. Skolaut, 286 Kan. 219, 227-28, 182 P.3d 1231 [2008]).\n\n\n       Under the first step, the State must establish a probation violation by a\npreponderance of the evidence. State v. Inkelaar, 38 Kan. App. 2d 312, 315, 164 P.3d\n844 (2007). \"A preponderance of the evidence is established when the evidence\ndemonstrates a fact is more probably true than not true.\" 38 Kan. App. 2d at 315.\nAppellate courts review a district court's factual findings for substantial competent\nevidence and then determine de novo whether those findings support the district court's\nlegal conclusions. State v. Weber, 297 Kan. 805, 816, 304 P.3d 1262 (2013). Substantial\n\n                                              5\n\fcompetent evidence is legal and relevant evidence that a reasonable person could accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion. State v. May, 293 Kan. 858, 862, 269 P.3d 1260\n(2012). When reviewing for substantial competent evidence, appellate courts do not\nreweigh the evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses. State v. Combs, 280 Kan. 45,\n50, 118 P.3d 1259 (2005).\n\n\n       Once a probation violation has been established, the appropriate disposition rests\nwithin the district court's sound discretion unless an intermediate sanction is statutorily\nrequired. State v. Tafolla, 315 Kan. 324, 328, 508 P.3d 351 (2022); see K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 22-3716(b) and (c) (requiring graduated sanctions before revocation in certain\ncircumstances). Judicial discretion is abused when its decision is (1) arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable; (2) based on an error of law; or (3) based on an error of fact. State v.\nIngham, 308 Kan. 1466, 1469, 430 P.3d 931 (2018). Jesse bears the burden of showing\nan abuse of discretion. See State v. Thomas, 307 Kan. 733, 739, 415 P.3d 430 (2018). It is\nnot disputed that an intermediate sanction was not required here because Jesse was on\nprobation due to a dispositional departure by the sentencing judge. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       Here, the district court found Jesse violated his probation in two ways: (1) by\nfailing to report to his probation officer; and (2) by committing the offense of interference\nwith law enforcement. Although Jesse recognizes both violations in his brief, he only\nchallenges the district court's conclusion that he violated probation by not remaining law\nabiding. Kansas appellate courts have long followed the rule that issues not briefed by an\nappellant are considered waived or abandoned. State v. Davis, 313 Kan. 244, 248, 485\nP.3d 174 (2021). Likewise, points raised incidentally in a brief and not argued in it are\nseen as abandoned. State v. Meggerson, 312 Kan. 238, 246, 474 P.3d 761 (2020).\n\n\n       Since Jesse does not challenge the district court's finding that he violated probation\nby failing to report, we find he has abandoned that challenge. So we are left with whether\n\n                                              6\n\fthe district court would have revoked Jesse's probation had the failure to report been the\nonly violation. If so, the district court's unchallenged finding is dispositive. See Quinn v.\nState, 317 Kan. 624, 627, 537 P. 3d 94 (2023) (where unchallenged ground for court's\ndecision was dispositive, no need to address other grounds).\n\n\n       We have no problem concluding that Jesse's failure to report and to pursue\nrehabilitation would have resulted in the revocation of his probation even absent the\nalleged failure to remain law abiding. The court discussed at length the fact that Jesse's\nprobation was the result of a dispositional departure\u2014a departure that was granted due to\nthe court's belief that Jesse warranted an opportunity to be free and pursue rehabilitation.\nAlthough the district court was specific in its finding that Jesse's failure to complete drug\ntreatment was not the basis for the revocation, the court found it relevant that Jesse had\ndone nothing to even pursue it. The court noted that Jesse had failed to follow through\nwith this foundational promise he made to the court to convince it to grant a departure\nsentence\u2014an indication that he was no longer amenable to probation, and he should\nserve his underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to revoke Jesse's probation.\n\n\n   JESSE CANNOT USE A MOTION TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE TO ARGUE HIS\n                 UNDERLYING SENTENCE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n       Although he combines their discussion, Jesse raises two arguments here: (1) The\nrevised Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6801 et seq.,\nis unconstitutional because it violates his equal protection rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and sections one and two of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights; and (2) his sentence is illegal because it does not conform to\nthe KSGA.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       Yet Jesse acknowledges that the correct application of the KSGA requires\ndesignating his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction as a person felony since\nthe crime was designated as such at the time of his current conviction. See State v.\nTerrell, 315 Kan. 68, Syl. \u00b6 2, 504 P.3d 405 (2022) (\"Under the Kansas Sentencing\nGuidelines Act, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6801 et seq., all prior convictions, whether out-of-\nstate, pre-guidelines, or amended post-guidelines, are to be classified as person or\nnonperson as of the time the new crime is committed.\"); State v. Lyon, 58 Kan. App. 2d\n474, 492, 471 P.3d 716 (2020) (affirming designation of 2010 aggravated burglary\nconviction as a person felony since the crime as amended in 2016 remained a person\nfelony). In other words, Jesse concedes the district court did not err in calculating his\ncriminal history score under the KSGA, but he contends that if his Kansas conviction for\nattempted aggravated burglary had been committed in 1992 instead of 2015, he would\nbenefit from a more lenient criminal history calculus. In that case his sentence would\nhave been calculated based on a lower criminal history score. Because the KSGA treats\nhim differently than people with convictions for the same crime before the KSGA's\nexistence, Jesse claims his sentence \"does not afford [him] equal protection.\"\n\n\n       This leaves Jesse solely with the argument that the KSGA is unconstitutional as it\napplies to his situation. But fatal to this argument is the well-established Kansas Supreme\nCourt mandate that a criminal defendant cannot use a motion to correct illegal sentence to\nargue their sentence is unconstitutional. See State v. Bryant, 310 Kan. 920, 922-23, 453\nP.3d 279 (2019) (holding that motion to correct an illegal sentence is an inappropriate\nvehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a sentence). Accordingly, we cannot consider\nhis constitutional claim at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n\n       In sum, we affirm the district court's decision to revoke Jesse's probation and\nimpose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n                                              8\n\f                                            ***\n\n\n       ATCHESON, J., concurring: The Shawnee County District Court acted within its\njudicial discretion to revoke Defendant Brian Curtis Jesse's probation. So I concur in\naffirming that decision and briefly elaborate on what I understand to be our reasoning for\nthat result.\n\n\n       In an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Jesse violated the conditions\nof probation when he failed to report to his probation officer as required and when he\ncommitted the new crime of interference with law enforcement, a violation of K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904(a)(3), by impeding Clay Center police officers in their efforts to\ncapture a fugitive. The district court revoked Jesse's probation and ordered him to serve\nhis original 42-month prison sentence for possession of methamphetamine with the intent\nto distribute. When the district court originally sentenced Jesse, it granted him a\ndispositional departure from presumptive imprisonment to probation. The district court,\ntherefore, had the authority to order Jesse to serve the prison sentence upon a proved\nprobation violation, bypassing lesser jail sanctions typically required for first violations.\nSee K.S.A. 22-3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       On appeal, Jesse does not dispute that he failed to report and, thus, concedes that\nprobation violation. But he submits the evidence did not establish that he violated K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904. See State v. Gumfory, 281 Kan. 1168, 1170, 135 P.3d 1191 (2006)\n(State bears burden of proving probation violation by preponderance of evidence). For\npurposes of resolving the appeal, the majority assumes Jesse is correct in that respect and\nconsiders whether the district court would have revoked the probation for the failure to\nreport as a stand-alone violation. Under the circumstances, that is analytically sufficient.\nThe majority then correctly points out the district court had the statutory right to revoke\nJesse's probation and to order him to serve his prison sentence. In other words, the district\n\n\n                                              9\n\fcourt could have chosen to do so in the exercise of its judicial discretion. But that doesn't\nresolve the issue.\n\n\n       To affirm the district court's decision, we must be able to say the district court\nwould have exercised its discretion in that way based solely on Jesse's failure to report\u2014\nthe sort of violation commonly considered a \"technical\" one. See State v. Brown, 51 Kan.\nApp. 2d 876, 880, 357 P.3d 296 (2015) (technical violation entails conduct contrary to\nconditions of probation but not otherwise unlawful); State v. Torres, No. 125,142, 2023\nWL 6324394, at *5 (Kan. App. 2023) (unpublished opinion). So the outcome\ndeterminative question is this: Would the district court, in fact, have revoked Jesse for the\ntechnical violation? Not whether it legally could have done so.\n\n\n       To answer the controlling question, we must be able to reasonably conclude from\nthe record how the district court would have exercised its judicial discretion in a factual\ncircumstance at least somewhat different from the one it did consider. Otherwise, we are\nsimply guessing about what the district court might have done. Appellate courts cannot\ndeploy mere guesswork to supersede a discretionary call a district court never actually\nmade. Cf. State v. Herring, 312 Kan. 192, 201, 474 P.3d 285 (2020) (Although a\nreviewing court \"may think\" it knows what a district court would have done absent a\nlegal error, \"it cannot know for sure until the lower court does the [proper] analysis.\");\nState v. Jackson, No. 124,540, 2023 WL 176079, at *3 (Kan. App.) (unpublished\nopinion) (when district court makes legal error in exercising judicial discretion, appellate\ncourt typically should remand for further consideration), rev. denied 317 Kan. 846\n(2023).\n\n\n       Here, however, we do not have to guess. In explaining its decision to revoke\nJesse's probation and to send him to prison rather than extending his probation, the\ndistrict court expressly relied on the failure to report and a failure to engage in drug\ncounseling or treatment. In that context, the district court did not mention Jesse's\n\n                                              10\n\fostensible interference with the Clay Center police officers. We, therefore, may\nreasonably conclude the district court would have done exactly what it did do even in the\nabsence of the probation violation for interference. See State v. Wilson, 314 Kan. 517,\n524, 501 P.3d 885 (2022) (appellate court declines to infer district court would have\nrevoked probation based on available legal grounds it \"did not refer to or make findings\nunder\"). Accordingly, the record is sufficient to affirm the district court's ruling while\ngiving full play to the analytical assumption discarding the new-crime violation.\n\n\n       As to Jesse's second issue, I agree that he gets no relief at this juncture on his\nclaim that the determination of his original sentence and the underlying criminal history\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and, thus, did not conform to the Kansas sentencing guidelines. In an appeal\nfrom a probation revocation, a defendant cannot challenge the legal bases for the original\nsentence. Wilkerson v. State, 38 Kan. App. 2d 732, 734, 171 P.3d 671 (2007); State v.\nResto-Isaac, No. 122,226, 2021 WL 2387474, at *4 (Kan. App. 2021) (unpublished\nopinion). If we were to construe the point as a request to correct an illegal sentence under\nK.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-3504, it would fail because that statutory remedy does not cover\nconstitutional challenges to a sentence.

Bryant, 310 Kan. 920, 922, 453 P.3d 279\n(2019).\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f","                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,086\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                    v.\n\n                                       TIMOTHY E.

Kellner of aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child for his inappropriate touching of the six-year-old victim. He was sentenced\nto the statutory penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years served before\nany possibility of parole. On appeal Kellner claims that his conviction should be\nreversed, and he is entitled to a new trial because trial errors from prosecutorial missteps\nto erroneous jury instructions deprived him of a fair trial. In the event this court was\nunpersuaded to reverse the jury's decision based on those alleged errors, he also argues\nthat the district court abused its discretion by denying him a durational or dispositional\n\n                                                    1\n\fdeparture from the presumptive sentence. Despite the litany of errors asserted, this court\nfinds no reversible error and affirms Kellner's conviction and sentence.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On February 27, 2019, the State charged Timothy E. Kellner with two counts of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, arising from his alleged abuse of a then six-\nyear-old child on or between February 21 to 22, 2019, and sometime on or between\nDecember 25, 2018, and February 20, 2019. Although the State dismissed one of the\ncounts, after a trial in January 2022 the jury found Kellner guilty of one count of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child. Among Kellner\u2019s many allegations, he claims\nthere was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions, which requires this court to\nrecite the relevant facts underlying his conviction.\n\n\n       At trial the victim testified that she told her mom that Kellner \"had touched me in\nmy private\" and that her mom took her to talk to the police. The victim said that when she\nwas in her bed in the basement Kellner \"came in my room and laid beside me and started\nto pull down my pants. And then [he] had touched me\" with his \"arm and his hand\" on\nthe butt. She later testified that Kellner also pulled down her underwear at that time. On\ncross-examination the victim confirmed that Kellner touched her once in this manner.\n\n\n       The victim's mother testified that on the night of February 21, 2019, she and the\nvictim, her daughter, had fallen asleep on the living room couches, but she awoke at\nabout 12:30-1:00 a.m. and went to bed while her daughter continued to sleep on the\ncouch. The next day, on February 22, 2019, the victim's mother and her friend were in the\nliving room when the victim \"described a scenario from the evening before, at which\n[Kellner] caressed in between her legs with . . . what she believes is his arm.\" The\nvictim's mother and her friend took the victim to a police substation and met an officer\nwho interviewed the mother and her friend. The Axon video footage of that police\n\n                                              2\n\finterview was admitted at trial. On cross-examination, the victim's mother testified that at\nthat time she wanted to talk to Kellner because she did not want to jump to conclusions\nbut confirmed the officer did not allow her to talk to Kellner.\n\n\n       The officer transported the victim and her mother to the Child Advocacy Center\n(CAC) where the victim was interviewed outside the presence of her mother. The officer\nlater transported the victim and her mother to the hospital where nurses photographed and\nswabbed the victim.\n\n\n       The forensic nurse examined the victim at the hospital from 12:32 a.m. until after\n1:30 a.m. and documented on a diagram admitted into evidence that the victim had \"red,\npurple bruise with swelling\" on the labia majora and \"excess skin to the anal area\" in the\ntop part of her anus. The forensic nurse also confirmed that she took swabs from the\nvictim's labia majora where the bruising was seen, her labia minora, anal area, and the\nspace between her anus and vagina, as well as an oral swab so that they could gather the\nvictim's genetic information and compare it to any genetic material found elsewhere on\nher body. The forensic nurse confirmed that she did not see any pubic hairs, lubricants, or\nclothing fibers on the victim. She also confirmed that it was possible for a man to\ndischarge seminal fluid while sleeping.\n\n\n       On cross-examination, the victim's mother confirmed that at the time of the\nincident, the victim had a history of wetting the bed and that cleaning her up would\ngenerally require wiping between her legs and in her vaginal area. She also confirmed\nthat Kellner would sometimes clean the victim and the victim would sometimes sleep in\ntheir bed or want to be close to them. Although she testified that the next morning\nKellner told her that he had taken the victim to bed, she confirmed that Kellner did not\nreport changing the victim the night of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The mother's friend also testified about the victim's disclosure and that the victim\n\"came up to her mom and I, and told us that [Kellner] had touched her.\" After being\nasked, the victim said she was sure about what happened and then demonstrated that\nKellner touched her on her butt. The friend estimated that about an hour passed between\nthe victim's initial disclosure and getting to the police substation.\n\n\n       A detective interviewed the victim at the CAC at about 10:00 p.m. on February 22,\n2019, and a video of the Exploited and Missing Child Unit (EMCU) interview of the\nvictim was admitted at trial. During the EMCU interview, the detective stated that the\nvictim disclosed that two incidents occurred\u2014one after Christmas 2018 and one the night\nbefore the interview. During cross-examination, the detective confirmed that during the\ninitial victim interview she described that Kellner was standing during the incident but\ntestified at trial that he was laying down behind her. The detective also confirmed that a\nfew days after the interview, he spoke to the victim again and she told him that she had a\nwreck on her bicycle and had been scratched by a cat.\n\n\n       The detective also interviewed Kellner late in the evening of February 22, 2019,\nand confirmed that Kellner was able to answer the initial personal information questions,\nappeared to understand the questions, and gave appropriate responses. At trial the\ndetective recounted what Kellner said during the interrogation. The detective testified that\nKellner said \"he woke up around 3:00 in the morning. Went upstairs. Found [the victim]\nasleep on the couch . . . So he carried her back downstairs and placed her in bed.\" The\ndetective stated that during the interrogation, Kellner was very talkative about things\nirrelevant to the case but that he did not seem overly nervous. Kellner stated that he\npulled down the victim's pants and was \"rubbing his penis in between her legs.\" After that\ndisclosure, the detective testified that Kellner explained that when he was carrying the\nvictim, she told him that she loved him and \"that that's what set things in motion.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       During the interrogation Kellner explained that he accessed a video on his phone\nfrom the internet that he characterized as a Japanese video with a young-looking girl\nwhose father character in the video did something similar to the girl. The detective\nconfirmed that Kellner was describing placing his penis between the victim's legs. After\nobtaining a search warrant for Kellner's phone, the detective was able to view the video\nKellner described.\n\n\n       The detective confirmed that Kellner was not permitted to speak to his wife or\nother family during the interrogation. The detective also confirmed that during the\ninterrogation he was not wearing a firearm and was wearing a badge that was likely\ncovered by his jacket. However, the detective denied that Kellner was handcuffed and\nstated that Kellner \"could have asked to leave\" but confirmed that Kellner was placed in a\nlocked interrogation room with no windows and no phone and would have needed\nassistance to leave. The detective testified that Kellner likely sat in the interrogation room\nprior to the interrogation for about an hour and 15 minutes. The detective confirmed that\nhe continued to question Kellner despite knowing that he had a cold, had little sleep, and\nwas tired.\n\n\nThe Video and Forensic Data\n\n\n       A digital forensic examiner with the Wichita Police Department EMCU, Internet\nCrimes Against Children Task Force, testified that she examined Kellner's cell phone and\ncreated a report. She found the video described by Kellner as the Japanese video in the\nphone's deleted area \u2014 meaning it had previously been stored on the phone. The digital\nforensic examiner confirmed that in searching Kellner's cell phone she identified that he\nhad searched for pornography at 4:00 a.m. on the date of the alleged incident. The report\nshowing Kellner's relevant internet searches were admitted at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       A KBI forensic scientist testified that she received a synopsis of the allegations\nand the victim's sexual assault kit. She explained that after swabbing the victim's labia\nmajora and buttocks, she conducted two different tests for seminal fluid on the swabs.\nThe first chemical indicator test was negative for the presence of seminal fluid, but when\nshe viewed the swabs through a microscope she saw sperm, indicating the presence of\nseminal fluid. She then conducted a DNA profile analysis of the seminal fluid on the\nswab which revealed that the DNA profile from the seminal fluid was consistent with\nKellner's DNA profile. The forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-\nejaculation or ejaculation and that there \"needs to be some sort of stimulation and release\nin order for seminal fluid to be present.\" She confirmed that seminal fluid could be\nproduced during a \"wet dream\" and leak through clothing onto other items and confirmed\nthat DNA can be transferred by contact such as if a person picks up another.\n\n\n       A former crime scene investigator with the Wichita Police Department testified\nthat during the search of Kellner's home they used an alternative light source to identify\nfluids such as urine, semen, and sweat stains on the victim's bedsheets. However, stains\nidentified on the bedsheets did not indicate the presence of seminal fluid. So, there was\nno semen found on the victim's bedsheets.\n\n\n       The jury found Kellner guilty of one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a\nchild, and the State dismissed the second count. Kellner, through his attorney, moved for\ndispositional and durational departure. After a hearing on the motion, the district court\ndenied Kellner's motion and he was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25\nyears. Kellner appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Kellner appeals his conviction alleging the following errors: (1) the district court\nerred in admitting his statements made during interrogation; (2) the district court erred in\nfinding he waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16\nL. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) ; (3) the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss\nfor constitutional speedy trial violations; (4) there was insufficient evidence to show he\ntouched the victim with the required statutory intent; (5) the district court erred by\nomitting an essential element of the aggravated indecent liberties with a child jury\ninstruction; (6) the prosecutor erred in closing argument; (7) cumulative error denied him\na fair trial; and (8) the district court erred in denying his motion for durational and\ndispositional departure in sentencing. This court will address each allegation in turn.\n\n\nI. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING KELLNER VOLUNTARILY MADE THE\nINCULPATORY STATEMENTS DURING INTERROGATION\n\n\n\n       Kellner claims that his statements during interrogation were involuntary, and as\nsuch, the statements should not be admitted during trial. After a Jackson v. Denno\nhearing, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964), requested by the State,\nthe district court found Kellner's statements were freely, voluntarily, and knowingly made\nand thus admissible. This court reviews the district court's ruling after a hearing on the\nadmissibility of the victim's statements to police using a bifurcated standard by reviewing\n\"the factual underpinnings of the decision under a substantial competent evidence\nstandard and reviews the ultimate legal conclusion drawn from those facts de novo.\"\nState v. Lowery, 308 Kan. 1183, 1218, 427 P.3d 865 (2018) (quoting State v. Harris, 279\nKan. 163, 167, 105 P.3d 1258 [2005]). Substantial competent evidence is \"legal and\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as being sufficient to support a\nconclusion.\" State v. Walker, 283 Kan. 587, 595, 153 P.3d 1257 (2007). This court \"does\n\n\n                                               7\n\fnot reweigh evidence or assess the credibility of the witnesses but will give deference to\nthe trial court's findings of fact.\" Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1218.\n\n\n       The State has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\nKellner's statements were voluntarily made, that they were the product of his free and\nindependent will. See State v. Mattox, 305 Kan. 1015, 1042, 390 P.3d 514 (2017). This\ncourt considers the totality of the circumstances surrounding Kellner's confession to\ndetermine voluntariness. Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1218-19. The nonexclusive list of factors to\nconsider include: (1) the accused's mental condition; (2) the manner and duration of the\ninterrogation; (3) the ability of the accused to communicate on request with the outside\nworld; (4) the accused's age, intellect, and background; (5) the fairness of the officers in\nconducting the interrogation; and (6) the accused's fluency with the English language.\nState v. Parker, 311 Kan. 255, 259, 459 P.3d 793 (2020) (citing State v. Davis, 306 Kan.\n400, 417, 394 P.3d 817 [2017]); see also State v. Garcia, 297 Kan. 182, 188, 301 P.3d\n658 (2013) (\"These factors, even if established as true, do not necessarily conclusively\nestablish that the confession was involuntary.\").\n\n\n       \"'These factors are not to be weighed against one another with those favorable to a free\n       and voluntary confession offsetting those tending to the contrary. Instead, the situation\n       surrounding the giving of a confession may dissipate the import of an individual factor\n       that might otherwise have a coercive effect. Even after analyzing such dilution, if any, a\n       single factor or a combination of factors considered together may inevitably lead to a\n       conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect's will was overborne and the\n       confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.' [Citation omitted.]\" Mattox, 305\n       Kan. at 1043.\n\n\nAnalysis of this issue requires the court to review the facts surrounding Kellner's\ninculpatory statements during his interrogations. Kellner was taken to the CAC in the\nback of a police car and the detective confirmed that the police car door was probably\nlocked. Once inside the CAC, the detective testified that Kellner was brought directly to\n\n                                                    8\n\fan interview room, which locks the person inside, and the police interrogation started at\nabout 11:00 p.m. The video recording of the interrogation was admitted into evidence and\nshows that prior to questioning, Kellner denied having consumed illegal drugs or alcohol\nwithin the previous 24 hours but said he had taken ibuprofen and Nyquil or Dayquil due\nto a cold. He stated that he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that \"I've\nhad special ed,\" that he had slept the previous night from 8:30 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. and\nconfirmed that he understood the questions being asked. However, when asked, Kellner\ncould not recall his children's birthdays and said, \"My brain is just not, I'm trying to\nfigure out what's going on, trying to process why I'm here and what is going on in my\nworld right now and so my brain isn't where it needs to be.\"\n\n\n       After gathering initial information from Kellner, at approximately 11:20 p.m., the\ndetective notified Kellner they wanted to talk to him about a report that had been made\nand said \"because you're sitting down here in a room at a police station I'm going to go\nover your rights so you're aware of what your rights are . . . and then once we get to that\nif you want to talk to me then we'll get into why we're here, okay.\" The detective gave\nKellner a paper copy of his Miranda rights individually listed and a pen, then read\nthrough each right one at a time and asked Kellner each time whether he understood the\nright. Kellner verbally acknowledged that he understood his rights and initialed each line.\nThe detective also explained that \"you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and\nnot answer any questions or make any statements\" and Kellner said he understood that\nright. The detective then asked Kellner if he wanted to talk. Kellner paused for several\nseconds and responded, \"I'd just like to know what's going on.\" He then paused again for\nabout 20 seconds and eventually said \"Yeah.\" Kellner signed and dated the Miranda\nform, demonstrating he was willing to talk to the police at that time.\n\n\n       Before any questioning, Kellner knew that he was at the police station related to a\nreport from his wife. The detective had explained that \"a lot of times reports are made\nand, you know, we get a small piece of the puzzle \u2026 we won't know the full story until\n\n                                              9\n\fwe talk to you about it.\" Kellner later said \"I wish my wife would just talk to me. She just\nleaves and goes [to] Walmart and calls the cops on her husband.\" The detective then said,\n\" you know obviously a report was made tonight, um, saying some things had happened,\nyou know, earlier today or last night . . . .\"\n\n\n       Throughout the interview, Kellner talked about his home life, work schedule, the\nhome layout, where his kids sleep in the home, and how he feels like his life just consists\nof work and sleep and that he and his wife had been arguing. Kellner offered random\ninformation about his life\u2014chaos with the kids, lack of money, and accused his wife of\n\"planting things into [the kids'] heads.\" Eventually, the detective asked Kellner if he was\nhaving a hard time communicating, and Kellner responded \"Oh, I'm ADHD so I\nmean. . . . My mind breaks down into like a thousand different things.\" The detective\ntried to redirect Kellner to the victim's allegations, but Kellner was reluctant to talk about\nthe allegations.\n\n\nKellner's Inculpatory Statements\n\n\n       The detective suggested that perhaps Kellner put the victim in her bed and his\n\"mind slipped to a place it shouldn't have been for a minute\" and that the victim described\nit in a way to indicate that Kellner \"realized what's going on isn't right and it stopped.\" In\nresponse, Kellner said, \"That's all I could think about at work today,\" and the detective\nasked if Kellner was referring to \"what happened last night.\" Kellner then asked, \"Have\nyou ever had those moments where you just wish you could beat yourself up?\" Kellner\nexplained that he was \"scared\" because the detective had \"the power to essentially ruin\nmy life,\" and said that the detective had \"the power to take something that's not in family\nhistory, it's not, it's not in my upbringing.\" When the detective again asked what\nhappened with the victim, Kellner stated that his wife watches crime shows so he has\n\"seen how all this ends,\" that he would not be allowed to leave, and \"if I keep going\nforward that's exactly where I'm going to end.\"\n\n                                                 10\n\f       When the detective asked if Kellner laid down in the bed with the victim after he\nbrought her downstairs Kellner replied, \"Well I'm beat, I'm tired.\" The detective said,\n\"You're not saying no.\" Kellner then stated that he was tired and \"running on hardly any\nsleep.\" He then said, \"But I did not have a relationship with [the victim],\" to which the\ndetective said that the victim was not describing that but was \"describing something very\nclose to that.\" That is when Kellner said, \"I may have rubbed up against her\" with a \"hard\non.\"\n\n\n       After Kellner confirmed that he had an erection while lying next to the victim, the\ndetective asked a series of questions about how Kellner's penis became exposed during\nthat time. Kellner then said, \"I did make a mistake,\" \"It's crazy, one hour of my life,\" and\n\"It's not even one hour it's more like thirty minutes of my life.\" Kellner denied ejaculating\nwhile with the victim and explained that he went back to his room and ejaculated\n\"[b]ecause who I really wanted to be with was my wife.\" The detective asked what part of\nthe victim touched Kellner's penis and he said, \"Between her legs man.\" Kellner\neventually explained that the victim said she loved him, and \"[m]aybe what turned me on\nis the fact that [the victim] actually loved me.\" He had previously stated that \"[i]t was\nbeing close to her and just knowing that somebody loved you.\" Kellner said, \"the fact that\nit feels like somebody else obviously loves you or shows affection to you that your wife\nis not showing you.\" Kellner stated twice that \"I gave the wrong affection to the wrong\nperson,\" and that \"it wasn't planned\" and \"it was a mistake.\" He explained that his actions\nmimicked \"something I saw on the video\" showing a Japanese father with his daughter.\n\n\n       At approximately 1:40 a.m., the detective left and Kellner was given a smoke\nbreak. As the detective was leaving the room, Kellner said, \"My life is going to be ruined\nby one mistake,\" to which the detective replied, \"That isn't up to me.\" The detective\nreturned at 2:22 a.m. and asked if Kellner would consent to a search of his phone. Kellner\nexpressed concern that he had made a bad choice, and that he did not \"have legal\nrepresentation here, I don't know nothing about any of this process\" and that \"I can tell\n\n                                             11\n\fyou now it never ends well.\" The detective repeatedly asked Kellner to make a decision\nabout the phone, and told Kellner he could refuse. Kellner never responded so the\ndetective took his refusal to respond to be a no, and concluded the interview. When\nKellner asked the detective what he was supposed to do, the detective responded, \"That's\nnot an answer I can give you.\" The detective eventually notified Kellner he would be\ngoing to jail, and the evidence would be submitted to the district attorney's office. The\ninterview concluded at approximately 2:30 a.m.\n\n\nThe State's Jackson v. Denno Hearing\n\n\n       At the State's request and before the trial began, the district court held a hearing to\ndetermine whether Kellner's interview statements were voluntarily made under the\ntotality of the circumstances. The district court found that Kellner's mental state\nsupported a finding of voluntariness because Kellner was able to understand and respond\nto the detective's questions appropriately and did not appear to be under the influence,\nthough he was tired and veered off topic several times. Regarding the manner and\nduration of the interview, the court noted that Kellner was not under arrest or handcuffed,\nhe was given water and a smoke break, he was offered food, and the interview was not\nparticularly lengthy, which supported a finding of voluntariness. However, the interview\nwas late at night, Kellner was tired, he was driven to the CAC in a police car, was\nescorted inside by an officer, and was then locked inside an interrogation room. The court\nexplained that the detective acted fairly in conducting the interrogation, weighing in favor\nof voluntariness, as evidenced by the lack of threats or promises used, that the detective\ndid not raise his voice and accommodated Kellner's tendency to go off topic. The court\nfound Kellner's age and intellect also indicated voluntariness, though it did not describe\nits reasoning. The audio recording of the interrogation was admitted as evidence at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fKellner's Mental State\n\n\n       Kellner claims that his mental state weighs in favor of finding his statements\ninvoluntary because his ADHD, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, anxiety, and tiredness\nduring the interview made it difficult for him to understand and communicate. He also\nalleges that the detective implied that it would be in Kellner's best interest to confess, and\nthat a competency evaluation showed that Kellner needed things explained to him slowly.\nThe video and transcript of Kellner's interview clearly demonstrate that he had difficulty\nstaying focused, staying on topic, and appropriately responding to prompts from the\ndetective. Though Kellner's lack of focus could relate to his ADHD or other mental\nconditions, it could also be viewed as his desire to evade the topic. He verbalized his\nthoughts, answered direct questions, said he was worried about the consequences of his\nstatements, and clearly understood the questions and reason they were being asked. Much\nof Kellner's off-topic discussion includes shifting blame to his wife and lengthy\nexplanations or excuses for his behavior\u2014demonstrating that Kellner understood the\ndetective's questions and why he was being interviewed. Kellner also made several\nstatements demonstrating that he understood the detective was attempting to get Kellner\nto inculpate himself and that disclosure could lead to Kellner facing legal consequences.\nAlthough it is likely that Kellner was tired, he did not request to cease questioning but in\nfact continued talking and offering information for the entire interview. There is\nsubstantial competent evidence supporting the district court's determination that Kellner's\nmental state did not render his statements involuntary. See Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1222-23\n(declining to reweigh the evidence where the court found he was \"'responsive'\" to\nquestioning and not impaired by a lack of sleep or possible head injury).\n\n\nThe Manner and Duration of the Interview\n\n\n       Kellner was unrestrained during the interrogation, had access to water, was given a\nbreak to smoke, and the interrogation was relatively short, lasting less than three and a\n\n                                             13\n\fhalf hours including breaks. Additionally, the interviewing detective remained calm\nthroughout: he did not raise his voice, did not act physically imposing, did not threaten\nKellner, and did not engage in deception. Moreover, Kellner began making statements\nindicating knowledge of wrongdoing within an hour and a half. Although the interview\noccurred late at night and into the early morning hours, the totality of the interview\ndemonstrates that the late hour did not impact the manner of the interview in such a way\nas to make Kellner's statements involuntary. See e.g., Mattox, 305 Kan. at 1045 (finding\nstatements voluntary when the interviewer remained calm, the interrogation was about\nthree hours long, and the defendant began confessing shortly after the start of the\ninterrogation).\n\n\n       Kellner claims that he was denied requests to communicate with the outside world,\nspecifically that he was denied the ability to speak to his wife, who was his primary\nsupport, which made his statements involuntary. \"While isolation from the outside world\ncan be a factor in making an interrogation coercive, it is to be expected that police will\ntake steps to limit the ability of potential witnesses and suspects to communicate and,\npotentially, conspire during an investigation.\" Walker, 283 Kan. at 598. Additionally,\ndenial of a request to contact the outside world is not coercive where the defendant's\nrequest \"suggest[ed] his motivation for seeking outside contact was to gather information\nand, in turn, explains the police officers' reluctance to grant his request.\" 283 Kan. at 598.\nKellner knew that his wife called the police, and Kellner indicated that is why he wanted\nto talk to her. Kellner wanted information from his wife about the investigation and\nallegations, and the detectives very reasonably denied his request to speak to her. See 283\nKan. at 598.\n\n\nKellner's Age, Intellect, and Background\n\n\n       On appeal, Kellner argues that his age, intellect, and background do not support a\nfinding that his statements were voluntary under the circumstances. Although Kellner\n\n                                             14\n\fcompleted high school, took some technical classes at a community college, and\nmaintained employment, he claims that he also took special education courses\n\"throughout his life.\" Although Kellner had ADHD and some special education courses, a\nsocial worker who assessed his competency to stand trial found him of average intellect.\nAt the time of interrogation, he was 34 years old, had attended \"some college,\" worked as\na diesel tech and had an employment history. Moreover, during the interrogation, Kellner\nappeared to understand why he was there and why he was being asked the questions, and\nthe interrogators did not deceive him about the available evidence. Substantial competent\nevidence supports the district court's finding that, under the totality of the circumstances,\nKellner's age, intellect, and background demonstrate he made voluntary statements to\npolice officers.\n\n\nFairness of Interrogation Techniques\n\n\n       Kellner next argues the detective acted unfairly in conducting the interrogation by\ntelling Kellner the outcome would be better for him if he told the truth. He refers to the\ndetective's statement that \"'when it's all said and done I can say you know what, Tim\nmade a mistake but he owned up to it,'\" and that \"'if we can talk about why that happened\nand if it's just a, a lapse in judgment that something happened for a moment that should\nnot have happened, let's talk about that.'\" Unlike other cases where interrogators have\npromised or threatened outcomes related to the interrogee's statements\u2014here, the\ndetective did not cross that line. The detective's statements are general advice about how\nKellner's actions and willingness to be truthful could be viewed by the detective. \"'[M]ere\nadvice or admonition to the defendant to speak the truth, which does not import either a\nthreat or benefit, will not make a following confession incompetent.'\" State v. Farmer,\n285 Kan. 541, 554, 175 P.3d 221 (2008) (quoting State v. Kornstett, 62 Kan. 221, 227, 61\nP. 805 [1900], wherein a police officer told a defendant he would feel better if he told the\ntruth). The detective did not threaten worse treatment or promise benefits related to\nKellner talking.\n\n                                             15\n\f       Moreover, the detective explicitly said he could not make Kellner any guarantees\nor promises about the outcome, and Kellner acknowledged he understood. Kellner said\nthat his fear of repercussions was keeping him from talking freely and said, \"The only\nway I can talk about it then is if you tell me what they're going to do to me.\" The\ndetective replied that \"when I'm done talking to you I'm going to talk to my supervisor\nand a decision is going to be made.\" When Kellner expressed concern about what would\nbe done to him, the detective responded by saying, \"I'm not going to do anything to you.\nOkay. But we need to talk about this.\" Lastly, Kellner stated, \"I don't know what's going\nto happen to me man,\" and the detective replied that he didn't know what was going to\nhappen to Kellner but that he had seen cases go \"all which ways.\" The detective avoided\npromising Kellner leniency or a change in circumstance that could result from Kellner's\nstatements, which does not tend to show coercion. See State v. Swanigan, 279 Kan. 18,\n39, 106 P.3d 39 (2005) (finding threats of specific charges or increased penalty under the\nother circumstances of the interrogation showed the statements were not voluntary).\n\n\n       Kellner also claims that the detective's faux empathy and claims of helping\neffectively diluted the Miranda warning by decreasing Kellner's understanding that the\ndetective was an adversary. However, Kellner's own statements during the interrogation\nundermine his assertion on appeal. Kellner told the detective \"I know exactly what your\njob is,\" and that he had seen crime shows and knows \"exactly how this works.\" Kellner\nalso said that that he understood \"[y]ou're not going to let me walk out of this place.\" He\nalso expressed that talking to the detective could \"essentially ruin my life.\" Nothing about\nKellner's actions during the interrogation, his age, experience, or relationship with the\ninterrogating officer demonstrated that he believed the detective was acting as anything\nother than a legal authority investigating a report of wrongdoing.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances, including the manner and duration of the\ninterrogation, Kellner's intellect and age, his inability to communicate with his wife, and\nthe fairness of the interrogation techniques, demonstrate that Kellner's will was not\n\n                                             16\n\foverborne and that his statements were freely and voluntarily made. See Mattox, 305\nKan. at 1042-43. The district court did not err in admitting Kellner's statements at trial.\n\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING KELLNER WAIVED HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently\u2014\neither expressly or implicitly\u2014waive his right to remain silent during the interrogation.\n\n\n       The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords individuals the\nright to not be compelled to incriminate themselves. See e.g. Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU.S. at 439. This privilege provides that \"statements stemming from custodial\ninterrogation must be excluded unless the State demonstrates it used procedural\nsafeguards, i.e., Miranda warnings, to secure the defendant's privilege against self-\nincrimination.\" State v. Regelman, 309 Kan. 52, 59, 430 P.3d 946 (2018). However, once\nalerted to their rights, a suspect may waive those rights and inculpate themselves. \"If a\ndefendant voluntarily waives Miranda rights, any subsequent inculpatory statement must\nstill be voluntarily given.\" Khalil-Alsalaami v. State, 313 Kan. 472, 500, 486 P.3d 1216\n(2021). This waiver may be explicit or implicit.\n\n\n       A suspect may waive their Miranda privileges, either explicitly or implicitly, and\nlaw enforcement is not required to follow a specific, step-by-step procedure to obtain\nsuch waiver. State v. Parker, 311 Kan. 255, 258-59 (2020) (discussing methods and\nrequirements for obtaining waiver of Miranda privileges); State v. Kirtdoll, 281 Kan.\n1138, 1144, 136 P.3d 417 (2006) (finding Miranda waiver may be implicit or explicit).\nThis court reviews de novo whether a defendant voluntarily waived Miranda rights under\na totality of the circumstances. Kirtdoll, 281 Kan. at 1144. Typically, whether a\ndefendant's statements to law enforcement were voluntarily made\u2014as discussed above\u2014\nis a separate determination from whether the defendant waived their Miranda rights.\nKhalil-Alsalaami, 313 Kan. at 500; see also Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483. However, when as\n\n                                             17\n\fhere the waiver is arguably implicit, \"the issue of whether the defendant waived his or her\nMiranda rights can be virtually indistinguishable from the issue of whether the\ndefendant's statement was voluntary.\" Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Kellner knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently waived\u2014whether explicitly or implicitly\u2014his right to\nremain silent. The detective told Kellner that he wanted to talk to Kellner about a report\nthat was made to learn the whole story. He explained that because Kellner was sitting in a\npolice station, he wanted to go over Kellner's rights so that Kellner was \"aware of what\n[his] rights are.\" He then read through each right, asked Kellner if he understood them,\nand asked Kellner to initial if he understood the rights. This list of rights included\nKellner's right to decide at any time to invoke his right to remain silent and not answer\nany questions or make any statements, his right to speak to a lawyer, or have a lawyer\nappointed\u2014all of which Kellner acknowledged. Kellner verbally answered that he\nunderstood each right. The detective then asked, \"[H]aving these rights in mind do you\nwish to talk to me now?\" After a short pause, and expressing his desire to speak to his\nwife, Kellner eventually said, \"[Y]eah\" and signed and dated the form that he agreed to\nwaive his rights. There can be few more explicit acts to demonstrate waiver. Kellner did\nnot say he was confused about his rights, did not ask questions about the Miranda rights\nwhen they were explained, and never expressed his desire to exercise them at any time\nlater in the interrogation.\n\n\n       Although the detective did not fully explain the underlying reason for\nadministering Kellner's Miranda rights or the possible consequences of the interrogation,\nthis lack of disclosure was not deceptive and was not required. This court has reviewed\nmany interrogations where officers openly explained that the Miranda rights were being\nprovided because the accused was facing possible criminal charges, and still the accused\nvoluntarily waived their rights and made inculpatory statements. Although that scenario\nis preferred, officers are not required to rise to that level of disclosure. See e.g., Parker,\n\n                                               18\n\f311 Kan. at 258-59 (finding that officers met the minimum requirements by giving the\naccused a written copy of his Miranda rights and reading the rights aloud even though\nthey did not ask if he understood the rights). While the reason for giving Kellner his\nMiranda rights could have been more thorough, the detective did tell Kellner that the\npolice received a report, and the detective wanted to ask him questions related to that\nreport. Kellner also knew that his wife had called the police and that\u2014as he expressed\nduring the interrogation\u2014police investigate crimes and talking to them could have\nsignificant consequences. The detective did not deceive Kellner about the reason for the\ndetective's questions or the reason for the Miranda rights.\n\n\n       The detective read Kellner each Miranda right, asked if he understood them,\nallowed Kellner to initial his understanding, and then asked Kellner if he wished to waive\nthe rights and talk to the detective. Under the totality of these circumstances, Kellner\nexpressly and knowingly waived his Miranda rights and voluntarily talked to the\ndetective. Even if Kellner's waiver were insufficient to be explicit, his actions also\ndemonstrate an implicit waiver. When, as here, there is no evidence of coercion, a\ndefendant can implicitly waive their right to remain silent by confirming they understand\ntheir rights and engaging in conduct that demonstrates waiver, such as talking. Kirtdoll,\n281 Kan. at 1146.\n\n\n       The district court did not err in finding Kellner waived his right to remain silent\nduring the interrogation.\n\n\nIII. THE STATE DID NOT VIOLATE KELLNER'S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial\nbecause his case was pending for two years and ten months before the trial. The Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\u2014which is applicable to the states through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2014provides that \"the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n\n                                             19\n\fand public trial.\" State v. Owens, 310 Kan. 865, 869, 451 P.3d 467 (2019); Klopfer v.\nState of N.C., 386 U.S. 213, 222-23, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967). Unlike\nKansas's statutory right to speedy trial under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-3402, which provides\na specific number of days within which to bring a defendant to trial, the constitutional\nspeedy trial right does not create a strict timeframe. Rather, whether a trial is speedy\ndepends on the circumstances of each case. State v. Ford, 316 Kan. 558, 560, 519 P.3d\n456, 458 (2022).\n\n\n       This court exercises an unlimited review of Kellner's constitutional speedy trial\nclaim and considers the length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion\nof his right, and any resulting prejudice to the defendant to determine whether the State\nviolated a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S.\n514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972); State v. Shockley, 314 Kan. 46, 62,\n494 P.3d 832 (2021). These factors are considered and weighed against one another, and\nno one factor is controlling. State v. Weaver, 276 Kan. 504, 506, 78 P.3d 397 (2003).\n\n\nLength of Delay\n\n\n       \"'The constitutional protection of a speedy trial attaches when one becomes\naccused and the criminal prosecution begins, usually by either an indictment, an\ninformation, or an arrest, whichever first occurs.'\" Ford, 316 Kan. at 561 (quoting State v.\nRivera, 277 Kan. 109, 112, 83 P.3d 169 [2004]). Only if the delay is presumptively\nprejudicial does this court need to inquire further into the analysis. Weaver, 276 Kan. at\n506. Kellner was charged on February 27, 2019, and his trial began on January 18,\n2022\u2014a delay of two years and nearly eleven months.\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       The United States Supreme Court and Kansas Supreme Court have both found that\ndelays of more than three years triggered examination of the other three factors. See\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 533 (delay of five years); State v. Dolack, 216 Kan. 622,\n636, 533 P.2d 1282 (1975) (delay of over three years); State v. Hemminger, 210 Kan.\n587, 594, 502 P.2d 791 (1972) (delay of over four years). Assuming this almost three-\nyear delay is presumptively prejudicial, as did the district court, this court considers the\nother factors to determine if Kellner's constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.\n\n\nReason for Delay\n\n\n       Kellner acknowledges that his trial date was repeatedly delayed to accommodate\nhis three counsel changes, allow a competency evaluation, and due to the COVID-19\npandemic which halted trials for several months. The State did not request any\ncontinuances of the trial date. Kellner argues this factor should not weigh against him\nbecause the delays were due to \"more neutral reason[s].\" Although Kellner classifies his\nrequested continuances for trial preparation and a competency evaluation as \"neutral,\"\nthis court disagrees. See Rivera, 277 Kan. at 117 (where the court found defendant's\nrequests for continuance to prepare attributable to the defendant).\n\n\n       Here, only one delay is attributable to the State\u2014the time between the October\n2019 preliminary hearing and November 2019 jury trial control date. The rest of the\ncontinuances were attributable to Kellner to allow him to seek new counsel, allow his\nnew counsel time to prepare, and to allow his counsel to seek a competency evaluation of\nhim. As a result, this factor weights against Kellner.\n\n\nKellner's Assertion of the Right to Speedy Trial\n\n\n       Although it is the State's obligation to timely bring a defendant to trial, the court\ncan weigh a defendant's efforts to assert their right to a speedy trial. \"'[F]ailure to assert\n\n                                               21\n\fthe right will make it difficult for the defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy\ntrial.'\" Rivera, 277 Kan. at 117. Kellner first asserted his right to a speedy trial by filing a\npro se motion on November 24, 2021\u2014roughly two years and nine months after the State\nbrought charges against him. His attorney then filed a motion asserting his right to speedy\ntrial on January 8, 2022\u2014shortly before the scheduled trial.\n\n\n          Kellner waited until shortly before trial to assert his right, when little more could\nbe done to speed up the process, and only after repeatedly causing and requesting\ncontinuances of the trial date. This factor does not weigh against the State.\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner\n\n\n          Ultimately, the most important factor in this analysis is whether and to what\nextent, if any, Kellner was prejudiced by the delay. In analyzing whether the defendant\nsuffered prejudice, this court determines whether the defendant suffered (1) oppressive\npretrial incarceration, (2) constitutionally cognizable anxiety, (3) or impairment to the\nability to present a defense. Harris v. Champion, 15 F.3d 1538, 1559 (10th Cir. 1994).\nThe most important of these factors is the last because \"the inability of a defendant\nadequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\" Weaver, 276 Kan.\nat 511.\n\n\n          Kellner argues that his liberty was significantly restrained pre-trial for almost three\nyears which also caused him anxiety. Even assuming that the almost three-year pretrial\nincarceration was oppressive, there is no evidence that Kellner suffered particularized\nanxiety violative of his constitutional rights. A defendant asserting a cognizable claim for\nprejudice stemming from anxiety associated with prolonged pretrial incarceration must\nmake a \"'particularized and substantial showing of anxiety distinguishable from anxiety\nsuffered by other similarly situated defendants.'\" State v. Hurst, 62 Kan. App. 2d 614,\n623, 521 P.3d 1 (2022) (quoting State v. Bussart-Savaloja, 40 Kan. App. 2d 916, 925,\n\n                                                22\n\f198 P.3d 163 [2008]). Kellner asserts no allegations of particularized anxiety associated\nwith his pretrial incarceration.\n\n\n       Kellner lastly argues that the delay impacted his ability to assert a defense. Kellner\nclaims that the following line of trial testimony where the victim was unable to remember\ncertain details resulted from the trial delay and affected his ability to cross examine her:\n\n\n       \"Q.    Okay. And your testimony was that it was like with his arm or his hand?\n       \"A.    Yes.\n       \"Q.    Okay. Do you know if there was like a towel or some sort of clothing or\n       something that maybe was in his hands?\n       \"A.    No.\n       \"Q.    You don't know, or you - -\n       \"A.    I don't know.\n       \"Q.    Pardon me?\n       \"A.    I don't really know.\n       ...\n       \"Q.    Okay. Also, do you remember back in that timeframe liking to sleep with your\n       mom?\n       \"A.    Sometimes.\n       \"Q.    And liking to sleep with your dad sometimes?\n       \"A.    I don't remember that.\n       \"Q.    Okay. How about sleeping with your sister?\n       \"A.    Yes, I remember that.\"\n\n\n       While the victim testified that she did not recall facts related to a couple of\nquestions, such responses are not abnormal nor are they necessarily attributable to the\ndelay in trial. The victim was young\u2014under age seven\u2014at the time of the incident and\nstill young at the time of trial which makes it understandable that she may not recall\ndetails from her childhood. Moreover, Kellner fails to show how the victim's memory\nlapses as to these facts impeded his defense. The victim's memory as to these facts is not\n\n\n                                                23\n\fexculpatory, and if she had recalled in the negative as to either question, her testimony\ncould have been worse for the defendant. This court cannot guess or assume how Kellner\nbelieves the victim's inability to recall in the cited circumstances hurt his ability to form a\ndefense. Nor has he shown that the victim at such a young age would have recalled more\nas to these questions in a manner that would have helped his case had the trial proceeded\nearlier.\n\n\n       Here, the prejudice factors weigh heavily in favor of the State. Although the delay\nin the trial date was presumptively prejudicial, Kellner ultimately did not suffer any\nprejudice from that delay that violated his constitutional rights. Kellner caused, created,\nor requested most of the delays, he failed to assert his right to speedy trial until shortly\nbefore trial, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay.\n\n\nIV.    THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT KELLNER TOUCHED THE MINOR VICTIM\nWITH THE INTENT TO AROUSE OR SATISFY SEXUAL DESIRES\n\n\n\n       Kellner claims the State failed to prove that his lewd touching of the victim was\n\"done with\" the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires, and thus the State failed to\nprove he violated the aggravated indecent liberties with a child statute. The aggravated\nindecent liberties with a child statute under which Kellner was convicted provides that:\n\n\n       \"(b) Aggravated indecent liberties with a child is:\n       \". . .\n       \"(3) engaging in any of the following acts with a child who is under 14 years of age:\n       \"(A) Any lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the offender, done\n       or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of either the child\n       or the offender, or both.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A).\n\n\nKellner argues that \"[a] person might engage in lewd touching for other reasons or for no\nreason and might separately have an intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\" He claims,\n                                                    24\n\f\"The record is devoid of any evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that any\ntouching in this case was done with the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\" He\ndoes not claim that he was not sexually aroused, but claims the lewd touching was not\nwhat caused his arousal but that he was aroused because the victim said she loved him,\nand then he satisfied his sexual desire away from the victim.\n\n\n       This court reviews a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by reviewing the\nevidence in the most favorable light to the State \"to determine whether a rational\nfactfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\" without\nreweighing the credibility of the evidence. State v. Aguirre, 313 Kan. 189, 209, 485 P.3d\n576 (2021). This is a high burden, and this court will not reverse a guilty verdict without\nfinding the evidence \"so incredible that no reasonable fact-finder could find guilt beyond\na reasonable doubt.\" State v. Meggerson, 312 Kan. 238, 247, 474 P.3d 761 (2020).\n\n\n       Kellner fails to present evidence to meet this high burden. Although Kellner did\nnot admit his intent in touching the victim, that is not required. \"Intent is usually proven\nby inference arising from circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of a\ndefendant's state of mind is rarely available.\" State v. Gonzalez, 311 Kan. 281, 288, 460\nP.3d 348 (2020). Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support even the most serious\nconviction even when it does not exclude every other possible conclusion. State v.\nColson, 312 Kan. 739, 750, 480 P.3d 167 (2021); State v. Pattillo, 311 Kan. 995, 1003,\n469 P.3d 1250 (2020).\n\n\n       Kellner told the detective that \"[m]aybe what turned me on is the fact that [the\nvictim] actually loved me\" and told him \"I love you . . . .\" Kellner told the detective that\nwhile he was putting his penis between the victim's legs (like what he saw in the video he\nwatched on his phone) \"who I really wanted to be with was my wife. I wanted to be close\nto my wife.\" The evidence presented at trial was that seminal fluid consistent with\nKellner's DNA profile was found on the victim's labia and the KBI forensic scientist\n\n                                             25\n\ftestified that there \"needs to be some sort of stimulation and release in order for seminal\nfluid to be present.\" In closing, Kellner's counsel argued that the victim's description was\nconsistent with Kellner cleaning her after she wet the bed, that the detective\nacknowledged to Kellner that he did not believe Kellner's actions were intentional, and\nthat Kellner would not have left the victim after getting an erection if he wished to satisfy\nhis sexual desires with her.\n\n\n       The evidence most favorable to the State is sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder\nto infer that Kellner lewdly touched the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire and thus find him guilty of aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nV.     THE JURY INSTRUCTION CONTAINED THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AGGRAVATED\nINDECENT LIBERTIES WITH A CHILD\n\n\n\n       The parties agreed, without objection from Kellner, to use the standard PIK Crim.\n4th 55.121 (2016 Supp.) jury instruction language for the aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child charges. The jury instruction stated:\n\n\n       \"INSTRUCTION 6\n               \"In count one, the defendant is charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a\n       child. The defendant pleads not guilty.\n               \"To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n               \"1. The defendant engaged in lewd fondling or touching of [the victim].\n               \"2. The defendant intended to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the\n       defendant.\n               \"3. At the time of the act, [the victim] was less than 14 years old.\n               \"4. The defendant was 18 or more years old at the time the act occurred.\n               \"5. This act occurred on or between the 21st day of February, 2019 and the 22nd\n       day of February, 2019 in Sedgwick County, Kansas.\n\n\n                                                   26\n\f                \"'Lewd fondling or touching' means fondling or touching in a manner which\n       tends to undermine the morals of a child and is so clearly offensive as to outrage the\n       moral senses of a reasonable person. Lewd fondling or touching does not require contact\n       with the sex organ of one or the other.\n\n\n                \"The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\n       defendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant's desire or conscious objective to do\n       the act complained about by the State.\"\n\n\nThe elements of the instruction and definition of \"lewd fondling or touching\" are\nconsistent with the PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea of\nintent, is consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th 52.010\n(2021 Supp.).\n\n\n       Kellner argues for the first time on appeal that the provided jury instruction failed\nto connect the element of lewd fondling with the element of arousal or sexual desire and\nthus misstated the law. This court evaluates alleged jury instruction errors using a three-\nstep process to determine whether (1) there is appellate jurisdiction; (2) error occurred;\nand (3) any identified errors require reversal. Whether the defendant preserved their\nclaim for appeal at step one impacts any reversibility inquiry at step three. Before\nevaluating reversibility, this court must determine whether the jury instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate applying a de novo standard. State v. Holley, 313 Kan.\n249, 253-54, 485 P.3d 614 (2021).\n\n\nStep One: Kellner Failed to Object to the Jury Instruction at Trial\n\n\n       It is undisputed that Kellner failed to object to the provided jury instruction before\nthe district court. In fact, his attorney stated, \"I think that elements of the offense are\nlisted.\" Kellner's failure to preserve this issue by objecting at trial does not prohibit its\nappellate review but rather changes the review standard. Holley, 313 Kan. at 254. This\n\n                                                   27\n\fcourt reviews the unpreserved claim of jury instruction error for clear error. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 22-3414(3) (\"No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an\ninstruction . . . unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its\nverdict . . . unless the instruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly\nerroneous.\"). A jury instruction is clearly erroneous if it is legally or factually\ninappropriate and the appellate court is firmly convinced the jury would have reached a\ndifferent verdict if the erroneous instruction had not been given. The party claiming clear\nerror has the burden to show both error and prejudice. State v. Crosby, 312 Kan. 630,\n639, 479 P.3d 167 (2021).\n\n\nStep Two: The Provided Jury Instruction Was Legally And Factually Appropriate\n\n\n       This court evaluates jury instruction error by determining if it was legally and\nfactually appropriate. An instruction is legally appropriate if it fairly and accurately states\nthe applicable law. State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, 302, 382 P.3d 373 (2016). The jury\ninstruction is factually appropriate if it is \"supported by the particular facts of the case at\nbar.\" State v. Plummer, 295 Kan. 156, 161, 283 P.3d 202 (2012). In evaluating whether\nan instruction is factually appropriate, courts must determine whether there was sufficient\nfavorable evidence to the defendant to support the instruction. Holley, 313 Kan. at 255.\n\n\n       The jury instructions were taken from and matched the PIK instruction for\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, including the elements and definition of \"lewd\nfondling or touching.\" PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea\nof intent, was consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th\n52.010. As was done in this case, the Kansas Supreme Court \"'strongly recommend[s] the\nuse of PIK instructions, which knowledgeable committees develop to bring accuracy,\nclarity, and uniformity to instructions.'\" State v. Butler, 307 Kan. 831, 847, 416 P.3d 116\n(2018).\n\n\n                                               28\n\f       A \"trial court has the duty to inform the jury of every essential element of the\ncrime that is charged\" by using the language of the statute or other appropriate and\naccurate language. State v. Richardson, 290 Kan. 176, 181, 224 P.3d 553 (2010). The\njury instruction given matched the PIK and the statutory language of the offense, which\nprovides \"[a]ny lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the\noffender, done or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of\neither the child or the offender, or both.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A). The jury\ninstruction given included each essential element of the crime.\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the phrase \"done with\" should be considered an essential\nelement of the crime because it connects Kellner's intent of arousal or satisfying sexual\ndesire to the act of lewd touching. Although perhaps an interesting intellectual exercise,\nthis argument lacks merit in law and fact. The jury instruction contained the essential\nelement of the act followed by the essential element of the intent. A natural reading of the\ninstruction connects the act with the intent. In fact, if Kellner had merely desired to be\nsexually aroused or satisfy sexual desire, but had not lewdly touched the victim then there\nwould not be sufficient evidence to support a conviction for aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child. Additionally, the jury instruction explained that \"[t]he State must prove that\nthe defendant committed the crime intentionally,\" which means the defendant had the\n\"desire or conscious objective to do the act\" which further connected the act of lewd\ntouching to the required intent.\n\n\n       Kellner also argues that the instruction was factually inappropriate because at trial\nhe argued that his erection occurred before he laid the victim down; that he may have\nbumped against her with his erection; and he later got out of her bed to watch\npornography. So, Kellner apparently attempted to assert that he was aroused and\/or\nsatisfied his sexual desire both before and after lewdly touching the victim but the arousal\nand\/or sexual desire were wholly unrelated to the intervening lewd touching. He argues,\ntherefore, that inclusion of the was \"done with\" language would have been factually\n\n                                             29\n\fappropriate because the jury could have found that his lewd touching of the victim was\nnot \u201cdone with\u201d the requisite intent even though he was simultaneously sexually aroused\nand did contemporaneously satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       Kellner attempts to argue on appeal that the instruction could be read to find a\ndefendant guilty after engaging in lewd fondling or touching while contemporaneously\nintending to arouse or satisfy their sexual desires from unrelated acts. Such a\ncircumstance is difficult to imagine and was not presented in this case. The facts of this\ncase readily and easily connected Kellner's arousal to his lewd touching of the victim\nbecause Kellner admitted the victim's statement to him began his arousal that evening and\nthat he had watched a pornographic video that matched the allegations of his lewd\ntouching. Then, shortly after the lewd touching, he completed the physical release of his\narousal. There are no facts in this case demonstrating that Kellner engaged in lewd\ntouching separate and unrelated to his intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       There are other pattern jury instructions with separate illegal acts and requisite\nintent that use connective language to relate the act and intent. See, e.g., PIK Crim. 4th\n55.090 (2021 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant \"touched\" the victim, and\nthat \"touching was done with the intent\" to arouse or satisfy sexual desires); PIK Crim.\n4th 55.181 (2017 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant possessed a type of\nvisual depiction and \"did so\" with the requisite intent). While adding the \"done with\"\nlanguage would have been both legally and factually appropriate, its omission was not\nfactually or legally inappropriate. The aggravated indecent liberties with a child jury\ninstruction, including definitions, naturally connected the essential elements of the act\nand intent even without the \"done with\" language, which fairly and accurately states the\nlaw and is supported by the case facts. Just because a jury instruction could be better,\nclearer, or more complete does not make it factually or legally inappropriate or\ninaccurate. There was no error.\n\n\n                                             30\n\fStep Three: The Error Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Even assuming an error occurred, Kellner is not entitled to reversal of his\nconviction unless he can show the instruction was clearly erroneous and the jury would\nhave reached a different verdict absent the erroneous instruction. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3414(3) (\"No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction . . .\nunless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict . . . unless the\ninstruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly erroneous.\"); Crosby, 312 Kan.\nat 639. Kellner bears this heightened burden because he failed to object to the jury\ninstruction at trial and thus deprived the district court of an opportunity to avoid the\nalleged error and present the jury with an instruction that more clearly connected the act\nwith the intent.\n\n\n       As explained previously, there was ample evidence that Kellner engaged in lewd\nfondling or touching of the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desires.\nSeminal fluid consistent with Kellner's DNA was found on the victim's labia; Kellner\nadmitted to the detective that he rubbed his penis between the victim's legs imitating a\nvideo he saw and that he regretted the action; Kellner stated that he became aroused by\nthe victim's statement of love which occurred just before he touched her with his penis;\nand the forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-ejaculate or\nejaculate and that \"stimulation and release\" is needed for seminal fluid to be present.\nKellner presented no evidence that he was not intending to be aroused or satisfy sexual\ndesire when he lewdly touched the victim. His only evidence that his arousal or\nsatisfaction of sexual desire was not related to the lewd touching of the victim is that he\nleft the room before completing his masturbatory act, and perhaps that he wished he was\ntouching his wife when touching the victim.\n\n\n       There is no evidence that convinces this court that the jury would have reached a\ndifferent result had the jury instruction more clearly connected the actus reus: Kellner's\n\n                                               31\n\flewd touching of the victim, with the means rea, Kellner's intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire. To be clear, the instruction was not erroneous, and this analysis is provided\nsimply for completeness. But even assuming the provided jury instruction was not legally\nor factually appropriate, it was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nVI.    KELLNER'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Kellner asserts that during closing argument, the prosecutor made several \"we\nknow\" statements, provided his opinion, and misstated the law, cumulatively creating\nreversible error. This court evaluates claims of prosecutorial misconduct in two steps to\ndetermine whether an error occurred and then determining if the identified error\nprejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial. State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 109, 378\nP.3d 1060 (2016). An error occurs when this court finds that \"the prosecutor's comments\nfall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors\" and offends the defendant's rights.\nState v. Alfaro-Valleda, 314 Kan. 526, 538, 502 P.3d 66 (2022). If such an error occurred,\nthis court must then determine if that error prejudiced the defendant. 314 Kan. at 538.\nWhen both constitutional and nonconstitutional prosecutorial errors have occurred, an\nappellate court applies the constitutional harmless standard to determine whether the\nState can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of will not or\ndid not affect the outcome of the trial in light of the entire record. Sherman, 305 Kan. at\n100 (citing State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, Syl \u00b6 6, 256 P.3d 801 [2011]).\n\n\nThe Prosecutor's \"We know\" Statements\n\n\n       First, Kellner argues the prosecutor erred in making the following \"we know\"\nstatements regarding allegedly disputed facts:\n\n\n       1. \"So let's walk through the timeline. We know how the disclosure happened based on\n          the evidence. This is the evidence of what happened. [The victim] goes to sleep. [The\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f           victim] goes to school. When she gets home from school, [the mom's friend] is over\n           there with her mom. And she tells her: 'Daddy touched my butt.'\"\n\n\n       2. \"And what do we also know from the DNA? We know that seminal fluid was found\n           on [the victim]. Now you can debate whether you believe that's pre-ejaculate or\n           ejaculation. The defendant told Detective Ribble he did not ejaculate. Nevertheless,\n           seminal fluid comes from a male, undisputed. It's on [the victim]. That's what the\n           evidence shows. The DNA\u2014this man, the defendant.\"\n\n\n       3. \"And remember, pornography in itself is not the issue here. It's not illegal to view it.\n           Adult pornography, it's not the issue. It's reliving a sexual fantasy with a child that is\n           illegal. That's the focus here. And we know from the sperm found in that seminal\n           fluid what he wanted to accomplish, that he had to go elsewhere to finish.\"\n\n\n       4. \"I will submit to you, the evidence tells you very clearly this wasn't a mistake. This\n           wasn't an accident. He made a decision. He intended to gratify himself sexually. He\n           may not have completed the entire mission, but that's what his intent was when he\n           touched her, and that's what the law requires the State to prove.\n\n           \"How do we know that? How do you know that? Look at his words again, his\n           consciousness. The struggles he goes through in that interview with Detective\n           Ribble.\"\n\n\n       A prosecutor's use of \"we know\" statements in closing argument can lead to error\nwhen those statements are used \"in the context of making inferences for the jury because\nthat use convey[s] the prosecutor's opinion, which is irrelevant.\" Alfaro-Valleda, 314\nKan. at 538. The use of \"we know\" statements related to disputed or controverted facts or\nto draw conclusions or inferences creates a risk of the prosecutor's opinion\u2014even if\nbased on reasonable inference\u2014being presented as evidence to the jury. However, the\n\"use of a 'we know' statement is not prosecutorial error when the evidence being\ndiscussed is not controverted.\" 314 Kan. at 538.\n\n\n\n                                                    33\n\f       Although he alleges the prosecutor's \"we know\" statements concerned\ncontroverted facts, Kellner fails to identify how the statements are controverted. The first\n\"we know\" statement\u2014that \"[w]e know how the disclosure happened\"\u2014 was an\nuncontroverted fact. The victim's mom testified as to the disclosure, and there was no\nevidence to controvert its occurrence. Kellner attempted to elicit testimony from the\nvictim's mom that the disclosure was nonchalant but did not contest its occurrence.\n\n\n       The second statement regarding the presence of seminal fluid with DNA matching\nKellner was controverted. Although Kellner did not present his own expert, his attorney\nattempted to elicit testimony from the State's expert to draw the DNA and presence of\nseminal fluid into question. Whether Kellner succeeded in drawing the KBI expert's\ntestimony into question is a matter of weight for the jury to decide. State v. Burton, 35\nKan. App. 2d 876, 882, 136 P.3d 945 (2006) (\"It is the jury's prerogative to decide the\ncredibility of witnesses, the weight to be given evidence, and the reasonable inferences to\nbe drawn from the evidence.\"). Therefore, the prosecutor's use of \"we know\" statements\ndrawing inferences from the DNA evidence\u2014no matter how reasonable\u2014was an error.\n\n\n       The third and fourth statements\u2014regarding evidence of Kellner's intent to gratify\nhimself sexually\u2014also referenced a controverted fact. Kellner denied ejaculating or\nleaving seminal fluid on the victim. The prosecutor discussed Kellner's demeanor in the\ninterview and his statements from which the jury could infer Kellner's intent, which\nexceeds the prosecutor's wide latitude. \"A prosecutor inferring from evidence and adding\nthat 'we know' the inference is valid crosses the line by giving the prosecutor's opinion\nabout the strength and meaning of the evidence.\" Alfaro-Valleda, 314 Kan. at 540.\n\n\n       Three of the \"we know\" statements Kellner points to constitute error as they\nreferred to controverted facts, but that is not the end of the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\fThe Prosecutor's Personal Opinion\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that the prosecutor erroneously inserted his personal opinion\ninto the argument by stating:\n\n\n                \"He talks about where he put his penis. The swabs of the DNA show you how\n       lewd it was, because there's seminal fluid there. Remember, there's bruising. Use your\n       common sense. If rubbing against a little girl for 30 minutes with your erection, is that\n       causing any type of injury? You could say: But it could have been anything. It could have\n       been a bicycle accident. I'm not going to believe that. The seminal fluid is not from a\n       bicycle accident. It's from his penis.\"\n\n\nAs Kellner alleges, the prosecutor stating his opinion that the victim's labia bruising\ncould not have been caused from a source other than Kellner is prosecutorial error. The\nprosecutor's opinion statement goes beyond reciting the evidence to create an inference\nfor the jury to draw, and inappropriately completes the inferential loop. State v. Pribble,\n304 Kan. 824, 835, 375 P.3d 966 (2016) (arguing the evidence contradicts the\ndefendant's testimony is acceptable, but a prosecutor's statement that they \"don't believe\"\nthe defendant's statement crosses the line).\n\n\nMisstatement of the Law\n\n\n       Kellner next alleges that the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument\nwhen he said:\n                \"So this is a question that I submit that you need to answer. Did he lewdly fondle\n       or touch her? What does the evidence show you? This is the instruction, the definition of\n       lewd fondling and touching. It's in your packet on both of the counts.\n                \"What you don't see here is whether it's an intentional touching. The intent comes\n       about the sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching? The\n       definition of what the lewd fondling, touching is about, whether the type and manner in\n\n\n                                                   35\n\f       which it occurs would undermine the morals of a child and clearly be offensive to the\n       outrage and moral senses of a reasonable person.\"\n\n\nAs with his previous argument regarding the jury instruction, Kellner asserts that because\nthe prosecutor's explanation of the charge did not include the phrase \"done with\"\nconnecting the lewd touching with the arousal or sexual desire intent, the prosecutor's\nstatement was an incorrect recitation of the law.\n\n\n       As previously explained, the prosecutor's statement of the law was not erroneous.\nFirst, the prosecutor explained the definition of \"lewd fondling or touching\" by pointing\nto the jury instruction. The prosecutor then explained that Kellner's \"intent comes about\nthe sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching?\" In making this\nstatement, the prosecutor explained that Kellner's intent must be connected to his lewd\ntouching of the victim. This is an accurate statement of the law. See also State v. Dinh\nLoc Ta, 296 Kan. 230, 242-43, 290 P.3d 652 (2012) (both intent and a lewd touch are\nnecessary to commit aggravated indecent liberties with a child, but the intent does not\nmake every touch lewd).\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner from the Prosecutorial Errors\n\n\n       After finding four of the prosecutor's statements constitute error, this court must\ndetermine if the defendant was prejudiced by those errors by determining whether \"there\nis no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict.\" Sherman, 305 Kan.\nat 109. Kellner argues that the State cannot meet this burden because there is no evidence\nthat his lewd touching was \"done with\" the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\n\n\n       The court considered several factors to determine harmlessness, including the\nstrength of the evidence, mitigating factors, the prosecutor's statements surrounding the\nerroneous statements, and the strength of the case. See State v. Brown, 316 Kan. 154,\n\n                                                  36\n\f172, 513 P.3d 1207 (2022) (requiring analysis of multiple factors because prejudice may\nbe found even in strong cases). Although the State heavily relies on the overwhelming\nevidence of Kellner's guilt, there is other evidence of harmlessness. First, the district\ncourt mitigated potential prejudice to the defendant by instructing the jury prior to closing\nthat the \"[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are intended to help you in\nunderstanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they're not evidence. If any\nstatements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should be disregarded.\"\nThen again, immediately before the prosecutor's closing argument the judge said, \"[a]nd\nremember . . . that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence.\" Such\ninstructions are intended to ensure that jurors understand the attorneys are advocates for\ntheir case, and that their statements do not constitute evidence. Courts assume that jurors\nunderstand and follow these instructions, and this type of instruction can be weighed by\nappellate courts in determining whether a prosecutor's erroneous statements were\nharmless to the defendant's right to a fair trial. Brown, 316 Kan at 170.\n\n\n       Second, the prosecutor made the erroneous \"we know\" and opinion statements in\nthe context of discussing the evidence supporting those inferences and opinion. Each\nerroneous statement was made during the prosecutor's initial closing argument\u2014which\ncomprised fourteen transcript pages\u2014and were surrounded by statements of\nuncontroverted facts. The prosecutor did not make isolated assertions of opinion, and\nthese erroneous inference statements were based on or supported by the uncontroverted\nfacts of the case. For example, the prosecutor's opinion statement about the cause of the\nvictim's labia injury was presented with the evidence of Kellner's inculpatory statements\nabout his actions, the victim's contemporaneous statement, and the DNA evidence.\nMoreover, the jury was free to disagree with and had been instructed to disregard the\nprosecutor's opinion statement about the cause of the victim's labia injury. This was not a\nrunning theme or repetitive statement but rather an isolated comment within fourteen\npages of argument.\n\n\n                                              37\n\f       Finally, the prosecutor's closing argument demonstrated the strength of the\nprosecutor's case. Kellner's own inculpatory statements made most of the facts\nuncontroverted. The victim very quickly reported Kellner's inappropriate touching. The\nvideo that inspired Kellner's conduct was located, and the seminal fluid with a DNA\nprofile consistent with Kellner was found on the victim's labia. Given the repeated\nmitigating statements from the court, the context of the erroneous statements, the number\nand timing of the erroneous statements in the context of the closing argument, and the\nstrength of the State's case, this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there is\nno reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's erroneous statements contributed to the\nverdict. See Brown, 316 Kan. at 170-72 (finding no prejudice from the prosecutor's \"we\nknow\" statements surrounded with discussions of the evidence that supported the\nconclusions when the inferences were reasonable and the evidence of guilt strong).\n\n\nVII.   CUMULATIVE ERROR DID NOT DEPRIVE KELLNER OF A FAIR TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the prosecutor's improper statements during closing and the\nlack of clarity in the jury instruction\u2014even if individually insufficient to require\nreversal\u2014constitute cumulative error that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCumulative trial errors, when considered together, may require reversal of the defendant's\nconviction when the totality of the circumstances establish that the defendant was\nsubstantially prejudiced by the errors and denied a fair trial. This court analyzes the\ncumulative effect of errors similarly to its analysis of each individual error by examining\nthe errors and how the judge dealt with the errors as they arose in context; evaluating the\nnature and number of errors and whether they are interrelated; and analyzing the overall\nstrength of the evidence. Just as with the individual errors discussed herein, because some\nof the alleged cumulative errors are constitutional, the State must establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the cumulative effect did not affect the outcome of the trial. Alfaro-\nValleda, 314 Kan. at 551-52. But the cumulative error analysis does not apply unless\n\n\n                                             38\n\fmultiple errors have been found. State v. Gonzalez, 307 Kan. 575, 598, 412 P.3d 968\n(2018).\n\n\n       Kellner successfully showed error only in the prosecutor's statements. Had Kellner\nshown the jury instruction was factually or legally erroneous\u2014even if it were not clearly\nerroneous\u2014then it could still be used to evaluate cumulative error to determine if the\ndefendant was deprived of the right to a fair trial. Because he failed to make such a\nshowing, and this court has already evaluated the cumulative effect of the prosecutorial\nerrors, additional inquiry is unnecessary.\n\n\nVIII. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING KELLNER'S\nMOTION FOR DISPOSITIONAL AND DURATIONAL DEPARTURE\n\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his\nmotion for departure and instead sentencing him to life imprisonment with a minimum of\n25 years served. Following trial, Kellner moved for dispositional and durational departure\ndue to: (1) his age, (2) his lack of prior criminal history, (3) mitigating circumstances\nincluding his stress, ADHD diagnosis, and addiction which interfered with his normal\nbehavior, (4) his willingness to abide by conditions set by the court including\nparticipating in programs for family preservation, and (5) that there was less harm in this\ncase than normally associated with this type of crime.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the court noted that the presentence investigation report (PSI) did\nnot provide a criminal history score because Kellner's crime of conviction was an off-grid\nperson felony. However, because Kellner had filed a motion for departure, the court\nnoted for the record that his history would have been \"I,\" meaning he had no scorable\nprior convictions pursuant to the grid. At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended\na life sentence with a mandatory 25-year minimum, and argued there was no substantial\nand compelling reason to depart from that statutory sentence. The victim's mother\n\n                                             39\n\fprovided a statement and asked the \"Court to take into consideration how much this has,\nnot only broken apart my family, but has created a series of kind of lifelong struggles that\nwe have to now deal with because of the actions that Mr. Kellner chose to take on that\nevening.\" The victim's guardian told the court that the victim wanted it \"to know that this\nhas all messed up my family and life since it happened.\"\n\n\n       In support of his motion for departure, Kellner's attorney argued that the\nlegislature used to leave it to families to resolve these types of inter-family issues, but\nnow \"there are situations where the legislature feels that the family needs to be\ncompletely destroyed and an individual sent to prison for essentially the rest of their life.\"\nThe attorney suggested that the court could take the opportunity to avoid destroying the\nfamily and instead treat sentencing as an \"opportunity to repair and rebuild and\nstrengthen the family\" because \"this is a case where family preservation appears to be\nwanted by all the parties.\" He argued the cost to the State for imprisoning Kellner could\nbe better used, and that with supportive services such as counseling, \"[w]e could reunite\nthis family and get them back to a healthy place. And that starts with a dispositional\ndeparture.\" The attorney then stated that \"it's not that big of a risk\" to depart because\nKellner would be on lifetime registration and lifetime parole with the underlying threat of\nreturning to prison if he did not follow through. As a result, departing downward and\nreturning back to the grid would be a \"win-win situation. It's a win for the family; it's a\nwin for the State.\"\n\n\n       Kellner's attorney also argued that Kellner had essentially no prior criminal\nhistory, there were no allegations of vaginal penetration, no allegations of intercourse,\nand no allegations of extensive sexual abuse. Rather, \"this is far from the worst situation\nthat any of us have ever listened to evidence on, or been presented in a courtroom.\"\nFurther, the attorney stated Kellner was suffering from \"some pressure and some stress,\nand so forth, that was involved in the family,\" and may have had an addiction to\npornography.\n\n                                              40\n\f       Kellner then provided his own statement to the court. He stated that he was a\nChristian and \"[i]n this whole process, I've forgiven everybody in this courtroom\u2014the\njury, my own family, and all my coworkers\u2014anybody I've ever come into contact with\nthat I felt was to blame for the reason why my life went the way it went.\" He eventually\nconcluded by stating that \"I love my kids. I love my wife, even to this day, and I forgive\nher, whether she forgives me or not.\"\n\n\n       Before ruling, the district court stated that \"what happened to that six-year-old . . .\nis not a family issue. It has never been a family issue. The legislature and people in the\nstate have never turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children because it happened\nwithin a family.\" Further, the court stated, \"one could argue that nobody involved in this\ncase needs your forgiveness for anything that happened in this case.\"\n\n\n       The court then went on to consider the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented\nwithout weighing them in relation to each other or in relation to any aggravating\ncircumstances. Regarding the evidence presented, the court stated that the DNA analysis\nwas credible and found Kellner's sperm on the victim in the place where she disclosed\nKellner touched her; Kellner admitted to something happening; and the alleged event was\nconsistent with the Japanese video Kellner said inspired him. Further, the court noted that\nit could take into consideration evidence which the State declined to present to the jury\u2014\nincluding that Kellner had \"websites of little kids dressed up in ballet outfits or\nHalloween costumes or nurse's costumes, and things of that nature.\"\n\n\n       The court stated that \"[w]hether it happens once or twice or twenty or a hundred\ntimes, you don't get a pass from molesting a child because it only happened once.\" In\nassessing the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented, the court noted his lack of\ncriminal history and allegation that he was under \"extreme stress.\" The district court\nrecognized that in the interrogation, Kellner spent a lot of time complaining to the officer\n\"about how hard your life was, and how unfair things were for you, and things of that\n\n                                              41\n\fnature. None rise to the level of excusing the behavior in which you were convicted of\nhere.\" Regarding Kellner's argument to preserve the family, the district court stated that it\nunderstood but it \"did not get the impression that the family wishes to\u2014has that same\nwish with you as part of it.\"\n\n\n       After considering the mitigating circumstances, the court found that there were \"no\nsubstantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence in this case.\"\nThe district court sentenced Kellner to a term of imprisonment for life, with a mandatory\nminimum term of 25 years; lifetime sex offender registration; and lifetime parole with\nelectronic monitoring. On appeal, this court must determine whether the sentencing court\nabused its discretion in declining to depart, and Kellner bears the burden of\ndemonstrating such abuse of discretion. State v. Thomas, 307 Kan. 733, 739, 415 P.3d\n430 (2018). \"A district court abuses its discretion when: (1) a ruling is based on an error\nof law; (2) a ruling is based on an error of fact, . . . or (3) a ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable.\" State v. Powell, 308 Kan. 895, 902, 425 P.3d 309 (2018).\n\n\n       When an adult defendant is convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child,\nthey \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life with a mandatory minimum\nterm of imprisonment of not less than 25 years . . . .\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(a)(1).\nHowever, for first time offenders, the court may depart\u2014and give a more lenient\nsentence\u2014if \"the judge finds substantial and compelling reasons, following a review of\nmitigating circumstances . . . .\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(d)(1). Those \"mitigating\ncircumstances\" include, but are not limited to, consideration of the defendant's lack of\nsignificant criminal history, that the defendant committed the crime while \"under the\ninfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbances,\" and the defendant's age at the\ntime of the crime. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(d)(2)(A), (B), (F). Also see State v. Jolly,\n301 Kan. 313, 322, 342 P.3d 935 (2015) (the plain language of the Jessica's Law\nsentencing statute instructs the sentencing court to conduct a review of mitigating\ncircumstances without balancing them against any aggravating circumstances).\n\n                                                42\n\f       The district court must first review the mitigating circumstances without weighing\nthem against any aggravating circumstance and then determine whether the mitigating\nfactors are substantial and compelling reason to depart from the mandatory sentence.\nJolly, 301 Kan. at 324. In this context, \"[s]omething is '\"substantial\" if it is \"real, not\nimagined; something with substance and not ephemeral,\" while the term \"compelling\"\nimplies that the court is forced, by the facts of a case, to leave the status quo or go beyond\nwhat is ordinary.'\" Powell, 308 Kan. at 914 (quoting Jolly, 301 Kan. at 323).\n\n\n       Kellner argues the district court failed to properly consider the mitigating factor of\nKellner not having any prior criminal history because it stated that \"[w]hether it happens\nonce or twice or twenty or a hundred times, you don't get a pass from molesting a child\nbecause it only happened once.\" This mischaracterizes the court's statement, which was\nmade in the context of explaining that the legislature requires a certain penalty for the\ncrime of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, and that is true regardless of how\nmany times the crime is committed. Ultimately, the district court stated that it considered\nKellner's lack of criminal history, and there is no indication that it failed to consider the\nfactor. The district court is not required to provide a detailed reason for why it determines\nthat each factor is not substantial enough to warrant departure from the statutory\nsentence. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 908 (Explaining that although the sentencing statute\nrequires a judge to explain the reasons for departure the \"statute does not oblige a district\ncourt to state its reasons for denying a departure motion.\")\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the district court failed to adequately consider his mental and\nemotional disturbance at the time he committed the crime as a mitigating factor. The\nsentencing court stated that it considered Kellner's assertion that the crime was\ncommitted while he was under extreme stress and that Kellner spent a great deal of time\nduring the interrogation talking about his life and why he felt it was unfair. However, the\ncourt then stated these circumstances did not \"rise to the level of excusing the behavior in\nwhich you were convicted of here.\" Kellner alleges that this statement demonstrates the\n\n                                               43\n\fcourt did not \"understand its responsibility to meaningfully consider mitigating\ncircumstances.\" The record indicates otherwise. The district court provided extensive\ndetail on its understanding of the process it was required to follow in sentencing Kellner,\nspecifically avoided inappropriately weighing any potential \"aggravating circumstances,\"\nand stated why it was denying his motion for departure.\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argued that the degree of harm caused in this case was less than\nusually associated with a crime of this nature. He argues the incident with the victim was\nbrief and she hardly remembered it; there was no evidence Kellner planned the\nencounter; he did not force the victim to do anything; he did not threaten victim or injure\nher; and did not hold her down and penetrate her vagina with anything including his\npenis. The victim testified clearly to the details of the assault, and her impact statement\nand the mother's statements at sentencing show Kellner's assault will have a lifetime\nimpact on the victim. Kellner is right that the district court provided no specific comment\nas to this asserted mitigating factor, but it did state that it considered Kellner's motion and\noral argument which meets the requirements when denying a departure motion. See\nPowell, 308 Kan. at 908-09.\n\n\n       The district court explained its reasoning and analysis in denying Kellner's motion\nfor departure. It appears to have considered each of the argued mitigating factors and did\nnot inappropriately weigh \"aggravating circumstances.\" The court's finding was not based\non an error of law or fact, and it was not arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable. While some\npeople or courts may have found Kellner's lack of criminal history and the facts of this\nassault warranted departure, this court cannot say that no reasonable person could take\nthe view adopted by the district court. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 902. \"[E]ven though\nmitigating circumstances must be present for a finding of substantial and compelling\nreasons, mitigating circumstances do not necessarily equal substantial and compelling\nreasons\" to depart. Jolly, 301 Kan. at 323. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner's motion for durational and dispositional departure.\n\n                                              44\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Kellner was convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, a heinous\ncrime against a young victim that affected the life of multiple people. Kellner waived his\nrights under Miranda, voluntarily made inculpatory statements during interrogation, and\nwas responsible for nearly all pretrial delays. The evidence supporting his conviction was\nstrong, and although some errors occurred during the trial, none of those individually or\ncumulatively warrant reversal. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner's motion for dispositional or durational departure. A jury convicted\nKellner of a serious crime, based in part on Kellner's own admissions, and the district\ncourt being in the best position to know all the facts and impact sentenced him\naccordingly. Finding no reversible error, this court affirms.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\f","                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,830\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                     v.\n\n                                           JOSEPH NEWMAN,\n                                              Appellant.\n\n\n                                    MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; SETH L. RUNDLE, judge. Submitted without oral argument.\nOpinion filed January 19, 2024. Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n        Peter Maharry, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, for appellant.\n\n\n        Lance J. Gillett, assistant district attorney, Marc Bennett, district attorney, and Kris W. Kobach,\nattorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., SCHROEDER and COBLE, JJ.\n\n\n        PER CURIAM: Joseph Newman agreed to plead no contest to two counts of theft,\nwhich would result in a presumptive probation sentence based on his criminal history\nscore. As a condition of probation, the district court ordered him to serve 60 days in the\ncounty jail but explained that the jail term could be reduced if Newman disclosed the\nlocation of the stolen property that had not been recovered. On appeal, Newman argues\nthe 60-day jail sanction must be vacated because the district court improperly punished\nhim for invoking his Fifth Amendment rights at sentencing. Yet because Newman has\nserved his entire sentence, we must dismiss his appeal as moot.\n\n                                                     1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       The State charged Newman with two counts of theft and two counts of criminal\nthreat. The charges stemmed from Newman's arrest for stealing a truck, which had about\n$2,500 worth of limestone in the bed, in June 2022. Although officers recovered the truck\nwhen they arrested Newman, they could not locate the limestone.\n\n\n       Newman entered a plea agreement in which he would plead no contest to the two\ncounts of theft and pay restitution in an amount to be determined before sentencing. In\nexchange, the State agreed to recommend the mid number in the appropriate grid box for\nthe charges and that the statutory presumption of probation be imposed. The district court\naccepted Newman's plea and found him guilty after confirming that he fully understood\nthe terms of the agreement.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the parties agreed that Newman's criminal history score was C,\nwhich made this a presumptive probation case. The State recommended the district court\nfollow the terms of the plea agreement by imposing the mid number in the appropriate\ngrid box for each offense. The State also recommended the counts be run concurrent with\neach other and requested restitution of $4,200 payable to Linda Smith. The State\nestimated Newman had been in jail \"around 90 days or so.\" Newman's defense counsel\nagreed that the district court should follow the plea agreement and proffered that the\ncharges resulted from \"frankly, a breakdown in [Newman's] mental health\" and that\nstabilizing Newman's mental health would be \"priority No. 1\" on probation.\n\n\n       After a rather contentious exchange, the details of which are set out below, the\ndistrict court ultimately sentenced Newman to the high number on both counts and ran\nthe counts consecutive for a controlling prison sentence of 20 months. But because it was\na presumptive probation case, the court suspended Newman's sentence for a probation\nterm of 12 months.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The heart of the substantive claim here involves the concerns expressed by Smith\nin both her victim impact statement and in her testimony at sentencing. Smith objected to\nNewman being granted probation until he revealed to whom he sold the limestone\u2014\nalthough there was no evidence that he sold the limestone to anyone. She asserted that the\nlimestone was vintage and could not be replaced.\n\n\n       Counsel for Newman advised the court that Newman \"would decline to make any\nfurther factual admissions today.\" Counsel further explained \"I'm aware Ms. Smith is\nseeking some additional admissions from my client, but we've made the admissions that\nare required to make under the plea agreement, and my client would decline to make any\nfurther admissions to these acts in this case.\" Defense counsel continued to implore the\ncourt to follow the plea agreement and impose probation since the State had no objection.\nDefense counsel reiterated that \"[m]y client is making no further admissions of fact\ntoday, and in addition, Your Honor, we would just simply request that you follow the\nplea agreement. We are agreeing to the number provided for restitution.\"\n\n\n       The district court explained it understood Smith's position and turned to defense\ncounsel, who reiterated that Newman was \"declining to answer further questions, as he\nhas a right to remain silent under the United States Constitution and the Kansas Bill of\nRights, Your Honor.\" The judge added that \"Mr. Newman certainly can't be compelled to\nanswer that question. But I do think that it is extremely distasteful for him to choose to do\nso.\" Smith stated that she agreed. The court explained to Newman that \"if you change\nyour mind about that, you are free to contact law enforcement and provide whatever\ninformation you can that might help them be able to recover that property, which isn't the\nkind of thing that can just be replaced with money.\" When Smith tried to interject again,\nthe court cut her off and ordered as follows:\n\n\n               \"Mr. Newman, I am going to impose a jail sanction as a condition of probation\n       today. I will order, in addition to the other conditions of probation ordered, that you\n\n                                                     3\n\f        spend 60 days in the Sedgwick County Jail without credit for time served. And if you\n        want to continue to stand on your constitutional rights to remain silent, you are free to do\n        so. We don't break people on the rack anymore. But if you are able to provide\n        information to law enforcement that is helpful to them in recovering the property, I will\n        consider whether you need to serve the entirety of that 60-day jail sanction.\"\n\n\n        The judge advised Smith that if Newman \"decides that he wants to get out of jail\non probation before he serves his 60-day jail sanction, he has the option that I just gave\nhim.\"\n\n\n        Defense counsel explained that Newman \"has no information to provide. He has\nno memory of where the limestone is.\" The court remarked that \"a minute ago, he had a\nconstitutional right not to talk. Now, he has no memory.\" Defense counsel countered that\nNewman \"has no memory . . . as this was a massive mental health break he was going\nthrough at the time, he genuinely doesn't know where it is.\" The court noted the response,\nthen asked if there was anything else to put on the record. After clarifying that there was\nno fine imposed and that a payment plan for restitution would be left to the probation\nofficer, the court concluded the hearing. Following the hearing, the court filed a\nsentencing journal entry, which reflected the 60-day probation sanction would \"begin\nimmediately,\" and that it \"could be suspended if defendant discloses the location of the\nlimestone.\"\n\n\n        Two days later, Newman filed a written objection and request for reconsideration\nof the 60-day jail sanction. Newman argued the sanction was imposed in violation of his\nstatutory right to allocution and his constitutional right to remain silent provided under\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. He also contended the probation condition was impermissibly\nvague because the court did not specify which law enforcement agency he should report\nany information to, nor what information the court would find acceptable. The district\ncourt declined to reconsider the 60-day jail sanction in an order filed four days after the\n                                                     4\n\fmotion was filed, noting that oral argument would not materially assist in determining the\nmerits.\n\n\n          Newman timely appealed.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n\n          Newman argues the district court improperly punished him for invoking his right\nto remain silent at sentencing in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But before\naddressing the merits of his argument, this court must first consider the State's claim that\nthe appeal is moot because Newman has served the entire incarceration portion of his\nsentence.\n\n\n          In support of its argument, the State filed a notice of change in custodial status\nfiled under Supreme Court Rule 2.042 (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at 18) on July 13, 2023,\nwhich included the following:\n\n\n             \u2022 A journal entry of probation revocation showing that the district court\n                 revoked Newman's probation on February 16, 2023, and ordered him to\n                 serve a modified prison sentence of 12 months. The journal entry also\n                 reflects that the court awarded jail credit for the time Newman spent in jail\n                 serving the 60-day jail sanction; and\n             \u2022 A letter from the Kansas Department of Corrections stating that Newman\n                 completed his modified prison sentence on June 17, 2023, and that his post-\n                 release supervision would run until at least December 17, 2023.\n\n\n          In a reply brief, Newman challenges the State's mootness claim by first arguing\nthat a previous ruling by this court's motion's panel in June 2023 denying the State's\n                                                 5\n\fmotion to dismiss is now the law of the case. See State v. Collier, 263 Kan. 629, 631-32,\n952 P.2d 1326 (1998) (describing law-of-the-case doctrine as \"'a discretionary policy\nwhich expresses the practice of the courts generally to refuse to reopen a matter already\ndecided, without limiting their power to do so'\"). But contrary to Newman's point, our\ncourt has held that a ruling of the motions panel is not a judgment on the merits of an\nissue but is instead a redirection of the issue to the panel assigned to hear the appeal.\nState v. Cotton, No. 109,934, 2014 WL 4916447, at *1 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished\nopinion) (addressing mootness claim on appeal after motions panel denied identical claim\n\"'on present showing'\"); see also Rock Chalk Hills, LLC v. Sweeney, No. 111,107, 2014\nWL 5801185, at *2 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished opinion) (reviewing jurisdiction and\nmootness issues after motions panel entered order retaining appeal).\n\n\n       Moreover, Newman ignores that the motions panel made its decision solely based\non the information available to it at the time\u2014which was that Newman had merely\nserved the sanction and was still on probation. Yet the documents included with the\nState's most recent notice of change in custodial status reflect that Newman's probation\nhad actually been revoked when the State first moved for a dismissal. And now his\ncustodial status has changed again since Newman is on postrelease supervision. These\nadditional factual developments bear consideration in determining whether the appeal is\nmoot. Put simply, we find the issue of mootness is properly before this court.\n\n\n       Generally, Kansas appellate courts do not decide moot questions or render\nadvisory opinions. State v. Roat, 311 Kan. 581, 590, 466 P.3d 439 (2020). The mootness\ndoctrine is a discretionary policy, under which the court is to determine real controversies\nabout the legal rights of persons and properties that are involved in the case properly\nbefore it and to adjudicate those rights in a way that is operative, final, and conclusive.\n311 Kan. at 590. An issue on appeal will only be dismissed as moot if it can be shown\nclearly and convincingly that the actual controversy has ended, the only judgment that\ncould be entered would be ineffectual for any purpose, and the judgment would not\n\n                                              6\n\fimpact any of the parties' rights. 311 Kan. at 584. A bright-line test, such as a rule that a\nsentencing appeal is moot if the sentence is completed, is contrary to Kansas law. 311\nKan. at 592. In a case like this, the State bears the initial burden of establishing the case is\nmoot by showing that Newman has fully completed the terms of his sentence. 311 Kan. at\n593.\n\n\n       Newman seems to concede that the issue is moot because he does not controvert\nthat he has completed the incarceration portion of his sentence, instead focusing on\narguing exceptions to the mootness doctrine in his reply brief. This court can accept the\nfilings included with the State's notice as reliable evidence confirming his custodial\nstatus. See State v. Yazell, No. 116,761, 2021 WL 402078, at *3 (Kan. App.)\n(unpublished opinion) (relying on signed sworn certification from KDOC records\ncustodian to support prima facie showing of the defendant's custodial status), rev. denied\n314 Kan. 859 (2021). Moreover, the documentation provided by the State shows the\ndistrict court modified his sentence substantially when it revoked his probation\u2014\nreducing the total prison term from 20 months to 12 months\u2014and awarded jail credit for\ntime served, including the time served for the 60-day jail sanction. These added facts\nunderscore the State's point that the appeal is moot because any judgment in Newman's\nfavor would be of no use to him.\n\n\n       A common exception to mootness is a finding that an issue \"'is capable of\nrepetition and raises concerns of public importance.'\" (Emphasis added.) State v. Kinder,\n307 Kan. 237, 244, 408 P.3d 114 (2018) (quoting State v. Hilton, 295 Kan. 845, 850, 286\nP.3d 871 [2012]). Newman, who bears the burden of proof, argues that this exception\nshould apply. See Roat, 311 Kan. at 593 (once mootness established, the burden shifts to\nnonmoving party to establish an exception).\n\n\n       Kansas courts have addressed whether an issue is capable of repetition by\nconsidering whether it is highly unlikely that anyone in the appellant's circumstance\n\n                                               7\n\fcould have obtained relief on appeal before the issue became moot. See Hilton, 295 Kan.\nat 851. On this point, Newman points out that the documentation provided by the State\nshows he completed serving the 60-day jail term before the record on appeal was\ncomplete and before appellate counsel even filed a brief. These assertions\u2014while correct\nand supported by the record\u2014are case-specific. Even so, Newman's broader point is\nconvincing because there is a real possibility that the issue presented here would evade\nreview given the time can lapse between a defendant's placement on probation and the\nresolution of an appeal.\n\n\n       Next, Newman asserts this is an issue of public importance because it concerns a\nfundamental right: the right to remain silent protected by the Fifth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But\npublic importance means more than that certain members of the general public are\ninterested in the decision of the appeal from motives of curiosity or because it may bear\nupon their individual rights or serve as a guide for their future conduct. Hilton, 295 Kan.\nat 851. Kansas courts will determine a moot question of public importance if the value of\nits determination as precedent is enough to overcome the rule against considering moot\nquestions. State ex rel. Stephan v. Johnson, 248 Kan. 286, 290, 807 P.2d 664 (1991).\n\n\n       This court has declined to apply this mootness exception where the atypical facts\nof the case suggest no public importance would be served by considering the merits. See\nState v. Burd, No. 114,398, 2016 WL 3856306, at *3 (Kan. App. 2016) (unpublished\nopinion); State v. Nicolaides, No. 114,239, 2016 WL 3856612, at *3 (Kan. App. 2016)\n(unpublished opinion). Burd and Nicolaides involved identical challenges by the\ndefendants claiming the district court erred by imposing their underlying sentence after\nrevoking probation instead of an intermediate sanction. In both cases, this court found the\nissue moot and declined to apply an exception because the facts of the cases were not\nfactually typical, and any precedential value of a decision on the merits would be\nminimal.\n\n                                             8\n\f       On the other hand, this court applied the exception Newman seeks to invoke in a\ncase involving a 60-day jail sanction ordered as a probation condition. See State v. Allen,\n55 Kan. App. 2d 87, 91, 407 P.3d 661 (2017). Allen is distinguishable, however, because\nthe issue raised in that case concerned whether the district court lacked the authority to\nimpose consecutive jail sanctions across two cases because of a statute requiring that the\nsanctions be served concurrently. Here, Newman does not challenge the district court's\nstatutory authority to order a 60-day jail sanction, but the constitutionality of the district\ncourt's action. As in Burd and Nicolaides, Newman does not articulate why his appeal is\nfactually typical to present an issue of public importance or describe how a determination\non the merits would create valuable precedent. As a result, we find the mootness\nexception for issues raising concerns of public importance inapplicable here.\n\n\n       In sum, we find Newman's appeal is moot because he has served the entire\nincarceration portion of his sentence and he establishes no mootness exception.\n\n\n       Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f","                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                       No. 115,964\n\n                                    STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                        Appellee,\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                  KYLE TREVOR FLACK,\n                                       Appellant.\n\n\n                             SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n1.\n       When the facts material to a decision on a motion to suppress evidence are not in\ndispute, the inquiry on appeal becomes a question of law.\n\n\n2.\n       Whether a defendant's repeated statements during a custodial interview to \"[t]ake\nme to jail\" constitute an unambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent depends on\ntheir context.\n\n\n3.\n       The ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in\nDeath Penalty Cases are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim in a capital case, but they are not coextensive with constitutional\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f4.\n        Appellate courts review continuance denials for abuse of discretion.

Flack, another friend of Stout's, occasionally spent time\nthere. Flack brought a shotgun with him everywhere, usually keeping it in a black duffel\nbag, and even slept with it nearby. Stout was dating K.B. and intended for the friends to\nmove out by May 1, so she and her 18-month-old daughter, L.B., could move in.\n\n\n       After not hearing from Stout, on May 6, some concerned friends went to his home\nto look for him. While checking an outbuilding near the house, they discovered a body\nunder a tarp, later identified as White. They called 911. Investigators found two more\nbodies in the house, later identified as Stout and K.B. The investigators suspected Flack,\nwho they located in Emporia at a friend's apartment. Officers arrested him shortly after\nmidnight on May 8, and read him his Miranda rights. They searched the Emporia\napartment, finding a black duffel bag. It contained a shotgun cleaning kit, a roll of duct\ntape, and zip ties.\n\n\n       Flack provided his versions of events to detectives twice after his arrest. His story\nevolved during those interviews. The first started around 3:30 a.m. on May 8 in Emporia.\nBy that time, officers had identified White's body in the outbuilding but not the two in the\nmaster bedroom. They considered L.B., the child, to be missing.\n                                          3\n\fFirst interview\n\n       In what the State depicts as Flack's first of eight versions of events, he claimed to\nlast see Stout, K.B., and L.B. on April 27 at Stout's house. He said Stout and K.B.\nplanned to go bowling after Flack and Stout bought cigarettes. Flack claimed they\nseparated in Pomona, where his friend, Kenneth Douglas, picked him up and drove him\nto Emporia.\n\n\n       As details emerged, so did inconsistencies. Flack said he and Stout went to Ottawa\nbefore Pomona. Stout dropped him off at the Pomona Dollar General, and Flack then\nwent to a nearby cemetery with two women, who later took him to Ottawa. From there,\nhis stepbrother picked him up, and he slept on the stepbrother's couch that night. He did\nnothing the next day, April 28, other than walk around Pomona.\n\n\n       Then, Flack said he went to Emporia on April 29. But before going, his stepfather\ndropped him off at Stout's house, where he played video games for a half hour. At that\ntime, some people stopped by looking for Stout. The stepfather returned and took him to\nthe Pomona Dollar General, where Douglas picked him up to go to Emporia. Flack said\nhe stayed with Douglas while there, and he bought a new cellphone after Douglas' kids\nbroke his old one. He later changed that story, saying he broke the phone himself. He\nacknowledged speaking to Stout's mother by both phone and text during this time.\n\n\n       Without prompting, Flack mentioned his shotgun, claiming Stout kept Flack's\n1300 Remington in his bedroom closet. He also mentioned buying \"PDX Defender\"\nshotgun shells from Wal-Mart a few months earlier.\n\n\n       Flack also claimed Stout sold marijuana, and every resident at Stout's house used\ndrugs. When describing White, he said White brought \"tweakers\" (methamphetamine\n\n                                              4\n\fusers) to Stout's and that made Stout nervous. The last time Flack saw him, White \"was\nfuckin' out of his mind, like been up too long, like you could see his eyes all fucking\nblack and sunk in.\" Flack got along with White, but he would not call him his \"best\nfriend.\"\n\n\n       Flack's second version began after Detective Tammy Alexander confronted him\nwith other witness statements. She told Flack that Douglas denied his kids broke the\nphone and said he picked up Flack in Emporia, not Pomona. Alexander told Flack the\nvictims were shot with a shotgun, and that \"Defender\" shotgun shells were at the scene;\nshe noted K.B.'s car was found in Emporia, where Flack had been.\n\n\n       Flack eventually said he was in Emporia to sell drugs. He sold \"dope\"\n(methamphetamine) to a group of Mexicans known as the South Side Lobos. He also\nclaimed to work for \"Omar,\" a bald-headed Mexican with a 13 tattooed on his chest,\nwhom he had met in prison. Omar, in turn, introduced Stout to \"Chewie,\" so Chewie\ncould supply Stout with marijuana for dealing. Omar drove him to Emporia, and from\nthere Douglas picked him up. Flack appeared to be explaining why he lied about the\nplace where he met Douglas and attempting to align his story with Douglas'.\n\n\n       Flack then mentioned going to Stout's on April 29 or 30. Finding the door locked\nand no one home, he walked to the outbuilding, where he noticed something unnatural\nbecause the dog's bowl was outside and windows left open. In the outbuilding, he saw a\nfoot hanging out from a tarp. Not knowing what to do, he left the residence.\n\n\n       The conversation returned to Omar, Chewie, and Flack's Emporia business. He\ndescribed delivering drugs for Omar right after being dropped off in Emporia. He said\nOmar gave him a car, telling him he could use it if needed. Seeing the car's license plate,\nFlack told Alexander that in \"[t]hat moment I knew it was my ass,\" because he realized it\n                                            5\n\fwas K.B.'s car. Even though he did not think it could be proven and did not know why\nOmar would want to kill Stout, he said, \"I guess they did it, but I don't know.\"\n\n\n       During questioning, Alexander showed Flack a mugshot and asked if he knew the\nperson. His answer was unclear. Alexander later testified the photo was of a long-\ndeceased person named Omar who had been arrested in Emporia but had never been in\nthe Hutchison prison while Flack was there. At the end of the Emporia interview,\nAlexander asked what happened to L.B. Flack told her \"they . . . took the kid,\" and \"the\ndude could be a child molester.\" Officers then transported Flack to Ottawa, where he\nrested and ate.\n\n\nSecond interview\n\n       The next day in Ottawa, Flack's interview began his third version. In this iteration,\nhe claimed Omar and Chewie killed Stout and K.B. while Flack was at the house. He did\nnot see L.B. that day. The murders happened a day or two before the people stopped by\nStout's and found Flack at the house alone.\n\n\n       On the day of the murders, Flack went to Stout's with Omar and Chewie, who\nwent in, while he stayed outside. Upon hearing a gunshot, he became frightened and fled.\nFlack saw Omar and Chewie carry duffel bags from the house. Flack contacted his\nstepfather for transportation. Flack spent time in Ottawa and Pomona before going back\nto Stout's, getting K.B.'s car, and driving it to Emporia.\n\n\n       Later in the interview, Flack's fourth version emerged, placing himself inside the\nhouse during the murders. According to this account, Omar, Chewie, and Flack were at\nStout's because Stout owed Omar money. All three went into the house, and, once inside,\nOmar and Chewie entered Stout's bedroom with Stout and shut the door. Flack heard two\n\n                                              6\n\fgunshots and ran out. Outside, he heard additional gunfire. Seeking cover under the front\nporch, he witnessed Omar leaving with drugs and a shotgun. After Omar and Chewie left,\nFlack discovered Stout's lifeless body in the bedroom under a pile of clothes. He then\ntook K.B.'s keys from her purse, walked to the outbuilding, and noticed another body\nunder a tarp. He took K.B.'s car to Ottawa, called Douglas to plan to visit Emporia, and\ndrove K.B.'s car to Emporia a day or two later.\n\n\n       Up to this point, Flack had not described White's death. That changed with his\nfifth version, in which he claimed a \"skinny Mexican\" killed White. Based on this\nversion, the day White died, he met with Omar, Chewie, and the Mexican in Ottawa and\nthey all drove to Stout's. Omar and the Mexican went inside where Stout, K.B., and\nWhite were. Flack and Chewie stayed outside. When Omar and the other man came back\noutside, everything seemed fine. Flack thought they would leave, but Omar asked about\nguns. Flack brought his shotgun outside, and the group took turns shooting it. White\ncame out and joined in.\n\n\n       After White fired the gun, he handed it to the Mexican. While the others chatted,\nWhite and the Mexican went to the outbuilding. Flack heard a gunshot. The Mexican\ncame out and went into the house with Chewie. Three more gunshots were fired. The two\nmen came back out with a duffel bag, keys, and a wallet. They then drove back to\nOttawa, leaving Flack with K.B.'s car. Omar told him to get rid of the car.\n\n\n       In his sixth version, Flack told detectives he and Stout shot White in mid-April. He\nclaimed Stout and White argued one day about White living there rent-free. Later that\nevening, Stout told Flack he did not know what to do about White. Flack told him, \"[J]ust\nshoot him.\" Stout replied, \"[I]f I do that[,] I'll have to bury him.\" Flack told Detective\nJeremi Thompson, \"[T]hat's when the joking stopped.\" The next day, Flack and Stout\n\n\n                                              7\n\fdiscussed the situation again. Responding to Stout's worry, Flack told him to \"just do\nwhatever you need to do\" and that he had Stout's \"back.\"\n\n\n       Not long after that, Stout asked White if he had gotten a job yet, which led to more\nbickering. White went outside. Stout grabbed Flack's shotgun, and he and Flack followed\nWhite. Stout shot White, who was in front of a car in the outbuilding. Stout gave Flack\nthe shotgun. Flack shot White again, which killed him. After hiding the body under a\ntarp, the two went inside the house and pondered next steps while smoking marijuana.\n\n\n       Flack's seventh version addressed Stout's murder. Flack said after White's murder,\nhe got paranoid. He called Omar to see if Omar could help him leave the area. Omar\nagreed but insisted on Stout returning the fronted drugs and money first. As a result,\nOmar and Chewie came to Stout's to settle up. Once there, Omar and Stout began\narguing. Eventually, Omar shot Stout twice in the back. Flack claimed Omar shot Stout\ntwo more times and then beat him with the shotgun. During the shooting, K.B. laid on the\nbed with her hands tied behind her back.\n\n\n       Either Omar or Chewie\u2014Flack could not remember who\u2014thought Flack looked\nstressed by what had happened, so they gave him money to buy marijuana. When he\ncame back, Flack found Stout dead under the clothing pile. He told the detectives Omar\ngave him the shotgun and said to get rid of it. He said he broke it down and threw it into a\ndumpster in Emporia.\n\n\n       In his eighth version, Flack described what happened to K.B. and L.B. When\nOmar killed Stout, K.B. tried to run out of the room. Chewie told Flack to grab her, so he\ndid. Flack found zip ties in his bag, and Chewie gave him a bandana to silence K.B.\nMeanwhile, L.B. entered the room. Chewie took K.B. to the living room, where he raped\nher.\n                                             8\n\f       Afterward, Chewie brought K.B. back to the bedroom and forced her to lie face\ndown on the floor. He shot K.B. with the shotgun. Chewie rolled her over next to Stout.\nHe and Omar started throwing clothes on the bodies. Then L.B. walked toward her\nmother. Chewie shot L.B. in the back and put her into a small suitcase he found in the\nbedroom. Omar and Chewie took the suitcase, drugs, and money to the car and left. They\ntold Flack it was \"his problem\" to get rid of K.B.'s car and the shotgun. Sitting on the\nporch, he called his brother to figure out whether to call the police or run. He drove to\nEmporia and stayed with Douglas for a few days.\n\n\n       The interview ended when Flack requested an attorney.\n\n\nPost-interview investigation\n\n       Investigators followed up on Flack's claims he met \"Omar\" in prison. They\nreviewed lists of inmates overlapping his time in prison, producing a few leads, but none\nwere \"Omar.\" They also reviewed his phone records, identifying most calls and who was\non the other end. No calls were connected to \"Omar\" or \"Chewie.\"\n\n\n       Emporia's city recycling center found a shotgun receiver and magazine in the trash\nand notified police. Forensic testing showed they were from the same gun that fired the\nshotgun shells discovered at Stout's.\n\n\n       On May 11, an Osage County sheriff's deputy found debris on a creek bank that\nled to locating L.B.'s body, which was contained in a partially submerged black suitcase.\n\n\n       Cell tower data for Flack's phone established that from May 1 until the morning of\nMay 3, his phone did not move from the general area of Stout's house. Around 10:40\n\n                                             9\n\fa.m., May 3, there was a single call attributed to his phone that registered on two towers,\nshowing Flack was about a mile-and-a-half from where police found L.B.'s body. Later\non May 3, the phone began using towers around Emporia. While there, Flack bought a\nnew phone, and the data showed him moving around Emporia on May 6 and May 7.\n\n\n       In mid-August, Flack's mother met him in jail, and the visit was recorded. Flack\ntold his mother, \"I'm gonna end up gettin' a lotta time outta this\" and \"I'm not guilty of all\nof it but I'm guilty.\" Flack also revealed he lied to police: \"[D]own the line they're gonna\nask me questions like . . . who else was involved . . . . And unfortunately . . . they didn't\nbelieve my fuckin' story. I tried tellin' 'em . . . some bullshit but they didn't\u2014uh, they\nalready had so much evidence I guess.\"\n\n\nCriminal proceedings\n\n       The State charged Flack with the capital murder of K.B. and L.B. in the same\ncourse of conduct, first-degree murder of Stout, first-degree murder of White, criminal\npossession of a firearm, and misdemeanor sexual battery of K.B. At arraignment, the\nState filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty based on five aggravators: (1)\nFlack was previously convicted of attempted second-degree murder; (2) he knowingly or\npurposefully killed more than one person; (3) he committed the crime to avoid or prevent\nlawful arrest or prosecution; (4) he killed K.B. in an especially heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel manner; and (5) he killed K.B. as a potential witness against him.\n\n\n       During the trial's guilt phase, the State's evidence included what is outlined above.\nIts theory was that the murders occurred in large part as Flack described, but it was he,\nrather than \"Omar\" or \"Chewie,\" who performed the acts. Flack did not testify. The jury\nfound him guilty on all counts except misdemeanor sexual battery. The court accepted the\n\n\n                                              10\n\fverdicts, and the State moved for a separate sentencing proceeding for the jury to\ndetermine whether to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n       During the penalty phase, the State relied on its guilt-phase evidence, as well as\nadditional evidence. To show K.B. suffered additional mental anguish from being unable\nto see, as she was not wearing her glasses at the time of her murder, the State presented\ntestimony\u2014showing K.B. always needed glasses to see\u2014and surveillance footage of\nK.B. wearing glasses on the presumed date of her death. The State also introduced\nevidence demonstrating Flack's previous conviction for attempted second-degree murder,\nalong with the journal entry for his previous conviction.\n\n\n       In mitigation, Flack again did not testify, instead presenting several witnesses,\nincluding an expert on how prisoners might acclimate to prison life; a prison work\nsupervisor whom Flack successfully worked with in prison; Flack's parole officer, who\nknew of no violations he committed since being paroled; and a supervisor at Ottawa\nSanitation, who described Flack as a good employee. He also presented evidence\nshowing Flack's horrific childhood of neglect and abuse. His friends and family testified\nhow their lives would be affected if Flack were to receive a death sentence.\n\n\n       Other witnesses\u2014many of whom were experts in mental illness and its\ntreatment\u2014testified about Flack's mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety,\nand hallucinations. His diagnoses include major depressive disorder, schizoaffective\ndisorder, anxiety disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. His mental health struggles\nplagued him in various ways, even to the date of trial, and would likely continue, though\nless so in a structured prison environment.\n\n\n       The jury found the second and fourth aggravating factors existed: Flack\nknowingly or purposefully murdered K.B. and L.B, and he killed K.B. in an especially\n                                         11\n\fheinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. It unanimously sentenced him to death. The judge\nfound \"that the aggravating factors totally outweighed any mitigating factors that were\nprovided and the evidence supports the imposition of the death penalty in this particular\ncase.\" See K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-6617(f). The court imposed the death penalty.\n\n\n       Flack directly appeals to this court. Jurisdiction is proper. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-\n6619(a) (permitting a death sentence to automatic review by and appeal to Supreme\nCourt).\n\n\n                        SUPPRESSION OF FLACK'S POLICE INTERVIEWS\n\n       Before both the preliminary hearing and trial, the State sought to admit Flack's\ncustodial statements to police. The defense argued against admission, claiming he\ninvoked his right to counsel. The court overruled his objections. Flack now argues he\ninvoked his right to silence through his repeated requests to be taken to jail, requiring\nsuppression of anything that followed.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n       When the State moved to admit Flack's custodial statements for the preliminary\nhearing, it submitted testimony from the detectives who interviewed Flack. The court\nfound the statements voluntary. It also found his alleged requests for counsel were\nequivocal and did not require the detectives to end the interview. It underscored the point\nby noting Flack knew what he had to do to end the Ottawa interview by plainly stating he\nwanted to talk to his attorney. This, the court held, was a clear communication the\ndetectives \"honored.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       At trial, a newly assigned judge took up the renewed motion to admit the custodial\nstatements for trial purposes. The State presented its witnesses again. Detective\nAlexander testified she advised Flack of his Miranda rights at the first interview in\nEmporia and had him sign a Miranda form. The transcript reflects his agreement to speak\nto the officers:\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: . . . Before you're asked any questions you must be advised and\n       understand your rights. Number one, you have the right to remain silent. Number two,\n       anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Number three, you have the\n       right to talk to a lawyer and have him with you while you've being questioned. Number\n       four, if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before\n       questioning if you wish. Number five, you can decide at any time to exercise these rights\n       and . . . not answer any questions or make any statements. . . .\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: I have read or had read to me a statement of the rights listed above. I\n       understand what the rights are and I am willing to answer questions before talking to a\n       lawyer. I do not want a lawyer present during questioning. I understand and know what I\n       am doing. No promises nor threats of any kind have been made to me and no pressure or\n       coercion of any kind has been used against me and this statement has been made by me\n       voluntarily.\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: If you agree to that, I'll have you sign it. All right, Kyle, you said\n       . . . that you were pissed off. You wanna talk to me about that?\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: Yeah.\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: What are you pissed off about?\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: 'Cause I wanna know what happened to my friend.'\" (Emphases\n       added.)\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\f       Alexander testified she did not perceive any of his statements during the Emporia\ninterview as invoking his rights. She agreed that a suspect saying, \"[T]ake me to jail[.]\nI'm done, I'm tired of you asking the same questions,\" was different from asking for a\nlawyer.\n\n\n       Detective Thompson testified he did not perceive Flack's statement\u2014\"'Should I\nget a lawyer honestly?'\"\u2014as a request for an attorney. Instead, he took it as asking\nThompson's \"opinion on what he should do.\" Thompson told Flack he \"could not give\nhim legal advice.\" And when Flack told Thompson, \"I can't tell you no more, so either do\nwhatever you do or I need an attorney or something because I can't tell you what I don't\nfucking know,\" the detective took it as an \"ultimatum\" when Flack became frustrated\nwith questioning. He testified that was a consistent pattern throughout questioning:\n\"[A]nytime we began asking questions in regard to [L.B.], he became upset. Visibly his\nface would turn red. He would clinch his fists, a couple times he hit the table.\"\n\n\n       Thompson noted the Ottawa interview ended when Flack said he could not talk to\nthe detective anymore and wanted his attorney. This remark, Thompson viewed, was\ndifferent because Flack's earlier mentions of an attorney were followed up by him quickly\nsaying he wanted to help and wanted to talk to the detectives.\n\n\n       The court admitted the custodial statements over the defense objection, finding\nthem voluntary. It also determined Flack's statements, \"'[s]hould I get a lawyer\nhonestly?'\" and \"either do whatever you do or I need an attorney . . . because I can't tell\nyou what I don't know,\" were equivocal and did not invoke the right to counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fPreservation\n\n       Flack now frames his remarks\u2014i.e., demanding to be taken to jail\u2014as an\ninvocation of his right to remain silent rather than the right to counsel. Generally, \"[a]\nparty may not object to the introduction of testimony on one ground at trial and assert\nanother ground on appeal.\" State v. Green, 315 Kan. 178, 183, 505 P.3d 377 (2022). But\nin death penalty cases, K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(b) mandates that \"we consider any\nerrors the parties raise on appeal, whether preserved for review or not.\" State v. Cheever,\n295 Kan. 229, 241, 284 P.3d 1007 (2012), vacated and remanded on other grounds 571\nU.S. 87, 134 S. Ct. 596, 187 L. Ed. 2d 519 (2013).\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n       We are at a bit of a disadvantage in this appeal. Had Flack argued the right-to-\nremain-silent issue before the district court, we would apply a bifurcated standard of\nreview. See State v. Aguirre, 301 Kan. 950, 954-55, 349 P.3d 1245 (2015) (district court's\nfactual finding reviewed for substantial competent evidence and its legal conclusion de\nnovo). But he did not, and the district court's factual findings about voluntariness and\ninvocation of his right to counsel minimally assist our appellate review. Regardless, the\nrecord includes the interviews' video clips and transcripts, so we can proceed. See State v.\nKleypas, 272 Kan. 894, Syl. \u00b6 5, 40 P.3d 139 (2001) (Kleypas I) (\"When the facts\nmaterial to a decision of the court on a motion to suppress evidence are not in dispute, the\nquestion of whether to suppress becomes a question of law. An appellate court's scope of\nreview on questions of law is unlimited.\"), overruled in part on other grounds by State v.\nMarsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.3d 445 (2004), rev'd on other grounds by 548 U.S. 163, 169-\n73, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006); see also State v. Hanke, 307 Kan. 823,\n827, 415 P.3d 966 (2018) (When the material facts supporting a district court's decision\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fon a motion to suppress evidence are not in dispute, the ultimate question of whether to\nsuppress is a question of law over which an appellate court has unlimited review.).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n       An accused's right to remain silent during a custodial police interview arises under\nboth the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 954. A suspect's invocation of the \"'right\nto remain silent must be scrupulously honored and cuts off further interrogation.'\" 301\nKan. at 954. But law enforcement officers' duty to \"scrupulously honor\" a suspect's\ndecision to invoke their right requires the suspect's clear communication without any\nambiguity or equivocation. 301 Kan. at 957. Such an invocation requires context, as \"an\ninvocation that is ambiguous by itself may be unambiguous when considered in\nconjunction with the statements or events preceding it.\" United States v. Cordier, 224 F.\nSupp. 3d 835, 840 (D.S.D. 2016) (relying on Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 105 S. Ct.\n490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 [1984]).\n\n\n       Another difficulty arises because Flack does not rely on any single statement as\nthe invocation of his right. Instead, he argues various statements to take him to jail\naggregated unambiguously to invoke his right to remain silent. He says his \"intention to\nend the questioning was equally clear as he became progressively more insistent that the\nquestioning stop and that he be taken to jail.\" But \"it is not his intent that matters; it is\nwhether his statement would have been unambiguous to a reasonable officer.\" Lopez v.\nJanda, 742 Fed. Appx. 211, 214 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished opinion). In other words,\nthe issue is whether his communication was unambiguous to a reasonable officer, not just\nhim. See Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 957 (a reasonable officer's understanding matters).\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Going back to the record, Flack made his remarks over about 45 minutes, with\nmost falling during an 18-minute span, when he grew increasingly agitated as detectives\nwere hesitant to believe him and countered his story with other evidence. He grew\nparticularly angry when they pressed him about the child's location, despite him denying\nhe knew anything. We address each comment below with its relevant context.\n\n\n       His first remark expresses his frustration at the detectives' refusal to believe him.\n\n\n                \"[Alexander]: . . . We have your dad who's sayin' something totally different\n       than what you did.\n\n\n                \"[Flack]: . . . What did he supposedly say that's different than me?\n\n\n                ....\n\n\n                \"[Alexander]: That all the times you're sayin' you were with him is not the case.\n\n\n                \"[Flack]: All right, whatever, so apparently we're at a stalemate so do I put these\n       back on and you take me somewhere or what's the deal?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       This plainly fails to invoke a right to remain silent. Flack merely acknowledges his\nversion differed from his father's, and the detectives were free to not believe him. His\nsecond comment was no different.\n\n\n                \"I didn't do it at all. Think I'd kill my fuckin' friends? Kidnapping some fuckin'\n       baby, take me to jail. . . . Put these motherfuckers on me, take me where you need to do\n       . . . . But I didn't kill my fuckin' friends. I didn't kill them fuckin' people and I didn't\n       fuckin' take no baby.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                      17\n\f       Like the first statement, Flack simply told Alexander she could believe he killed\nthe victims, claiming his innocence. His requests to be taken to jail after an impasse in\nquestioning were too ambiguous to invoke the right to silence. See, e.g., State v. Speed,\n265 Kan. 26, 37, 961 P.2d 13 (1998) (\"'And since we're not getting anywhere I just ask\nyou guys to go ahead and get this over with and go ahead and lock me up and let me go\nand deal with Sedgwick County, I'm ready to go to Sedgwick County, let's go.'\"); Bullitt\nv. Commonwealth, 595 S.W.3d 106, 116-17 (Ky. 2019) (holding the defendant's\nstatement\u2014\"[I]f I'm going to jail, I'm saying, let's go, you know, that's all I'm saying, sir.\nI'm innocent, I'm innocent.\"\u2014did not invoke the right to silence).\n\n\n       His next three comments followed that same pattern, and all convey he lacked an\nanswer for the detective.\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: Where would we go to find [L.B.]?\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: How the fuck should I know?\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: 'Cause you're the only one that does.\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: You know what? [Third comment] Put these on.\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: You're the only\u2014\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: Hey\u2014no\u2014\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: \u2014one that knows.\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: \u2014I ain't. I keep fuckin' tellin' you I don't know where the fuckin' baby\n       is.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f               ....\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Who do we talk to?\n\n\n               ....\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: How the\u2014I do not know. . . . I only speak one fuckin' language here. I\n       don't know where that baby is. I don't know what happened at that fuckin' house. But\n       apparently you guys got it all sewed up. So do whatever we're doin'. Because I can keep\n       tellin' ya the same fuckin' thing and you're gonna keep fuckin' the same thing. . . .\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Where was she left?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't fuckin' know. [Forth comment] Goddamn, quit\u2014\n\n\n               ....\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: . . . Who the fuck do we talk to, Kyle?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't fuckin' know. You know what? [Fifth comment] Wrap these up,\n       take me to fuckin' jail because obviously you're just gonna keep fuckin' goin' so I can't\n       give ya information I don't fuckin' have so do what you do.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n       Flack got heated and made these comments as Alexander asked about the child's\nwhereabouts. The third remark was a dramatic gesture, not a substantive cutting off of\nquestioning. The fourth was so brief; it was inscrutable. And the fifth appears to be\nanother \"take me to jail\" statement, \"because . . . I can't give ya information I don't\nfuckin' have so do what you do.\" (Emphases added.) Flack was communicating if the\nofficers keep asking questions he could not answer, they should just charge him. But,\ntaken together or separately, he does not unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent.\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f       A few minutes later, the detectives encountered strong resistance when asking\nFlack why he was in Emporia. In this context, Flack made his sixth alleged invocation:\n\"You wanna . . . fuckin' take me to jail, charge me, whatever, I\u2014we done sat here and\nfuckin' talked about it, okay? It's that simple.\" But again, he did not clearly state to stop\nthe interview. Instead, he expressed frustration the officers were unwilling to trust him.\n\n\n       The final four remarks occurred when Alexander asked for detail about his\nEmporia business involving \"some Mexicans.\"\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Who were you selling dope to?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: Some Mexicans.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: What are their names?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't know their fuckin' names.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Where do they live?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't know where they live. I meet 'em on the fuckin' south side, at\n       fuckin' at Saint Pablo Park.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Okay what do they drive?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: [Seventh comment] Take me to jail.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: What do they drive?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: Drive\u2014[Eighth comment] take me to jail man. . . .\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: What are their phone numbers?\n\n                                                   20\n\f        \"[Flack]: [Ninth comment] Take me to jail.\n\n\n        \"[Alexander]: Kyle, this is your opportunity to help yourself.\n\n\n        \"[Flack]: How am I helpin' myself?

A bunch of fuckin' Mexicans.\nThey're called SSLs, South Side Lobos. . . .\n\n\n        \"[Alexander]: What do you sell them?\n\n\n        \"[Flack]: Meth. . . .\n\n\n        \"[Alexander]: How much was this time?\n\n\n        \"[Flack]: Two pounds.\n\n\n        ....\n\n\n        \"[Alexander]: Who do you deliver for?\n\n\n        \"[Flack]: [Tenth comment] Take me to jail. . . .\n\n\n        \"[Alexander]: Okay, Kyle let's help yourself, okay?\n\n\n        \"[Flack]: There is no help myself. . . .\n\n\n        ....\n\n\n                                               21\n\f              \"[Alexander]: All right, then let's\u2014help out, okay?\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: I don't know the fuckin' people. . . . [T]hey just contact me, tell me to\n       pick it up.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n       Flack's comments here\u2014\"What do you want me to tell you?\"\u2014and his\nstatement\u2014\"I don't know the fuckin' people\"\u2014lead to a reasonable inference Flack\nmeant \"I don't know,\" rather than invoking his right to remain silent. As the State\ncorrectly argues, his claimed invocations were \"amenable to a variety of interpretations\"\nor \"an expression of frustration and anger,\" \"a recognition of his difficult predicament,\"\n\"a hyperbolic effort to bolster his own credibility and convince the detectives that he was\ntelling the truth,\" and \"a negotiating tactic . . . intended to shape the investigator's\ninterrogation more favorably to him.\" In context, these comments show Flack believed\nthe questioning about what happened at Stout's house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right. He simply claimed the detectives had already made up\ntheir minds about his involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help\nthem find the child.\n\n\n       Under the circumstances, Flack's \"take me to jail\" comments lead to multiple\ninterpretations\u2014rendering his communication unclear. Flack had experience with police\ninterviews; read the Miranda form, which stated with particularity \"you have the right to\nremain silent,\" and \"you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and . . . not\nanswer any questions or make any statements\"; affirmatively stated he understood his\nrights; and told the detectives he would answer their questions.\n\n\n       We hold Flack did not invoke his right to remain silent by repeatedly suggesting\nhe be taken to jail. Isolated or combined, his statements did not unambiguously and\nunequivocally assert his right to silence. See People v. Davis, 46 Cal. 4th 539, 587-88, 94\n\n                                                   22\n\fCal. Rptr. 3d 322, 208 P.3d 78 (2009) (holding defendant's statement\u2014\"'Well then book\nme and let's get a lawyer and let's go for it, you know'\"\u2014was a challenge to interrogators\nthat defendant employed as interrogation technique, not a means to invoke right to\ncounsel or silence; contrasting these comments with statements later in interrogation,\n\"'get me a lawyer'\" and \"'it's over and [he was] done'\" answering questions, that\nconstituted a valid invocation); Ridley v. State, 290 Ga. 798, 801-02, 725 S.E.2d 223\n(2012) (holding \"take me on to jail\" did not unequivocally invoke the right to silence);\nState v. Waloke, 835 N.W.2d 105, 112 (S.D. 2013) (rejecting the defendant invoked her\nright to silence by stating, \"officers should just take her to jail\" as she did not explicitly\nsay she wanted to remain silent or did not want to speak with police anymore); State v.\nCummings, 357 Wis. 2d 1, 24, 850 N.W.2d 915 (2014) (holding \"'take me to my cell.\nWhy waste your time?'\" in context not unequivocal invocation); Kirk v. Carroll, 243 F.\nSupp. 2d 125, 132 (D. Del. 2003) (denying habeas relief, reasoning Delaware state court\nconclusions that, \"'Just take me away, please. Take me away,'\" and \"'Just take me the\nfuck away,'\" were not clear invocations of right to silence was not contrary to clearly\nestablished federal law); Bird v. Brigano, 295 Fed. Appx. 36, 38 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(unpublished opinion) (analyzing two exchanges during interview, first Bird said \"'there's\nno sense me sitting here trying to say what happened with me . . . because as usual, when\nit comes to Derrick Bird, he's guilty'\" and then stood up and said, \"'You take me in; get\nbooked, man,'\" and second in response to detective explaining this is your chance to talk\nBird said, \"'Everything's right there in the paper. I'm done talking about it'\"; holding\nneither were unequivocal invocations of right to remain silent when viewed in context).\n\n\n       The district court properly admitted his custodial statements.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f                          FLACK'S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE\n\n\n        Throughout Flack's case, defense counsel expressed concern they would not be\nprepared for trial. That concern became especially acute after his original counsel\nwithdrew in 2015. In response, the court continued the proceedings until the following\nspring. Despite that, the defense requested another continuance and repeated such\nrequests through the pretrial proceedings.\n\n\n        Now, on appeal, Flack asserts the district court's scheduling orders violated his\nSixth Amendment due process right to present a defense, his corresponding rights under\nsections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights, and finally his statutory rights\nunder K.S.A. 22-3406 (reasonable time to prepare for trial) and K.S.A. 22-3401\n(continuances for good cause). From this, we discern two lines for analysis. First, he\nstatutorily argues the district court abused its discretion by denying persistent\ncontinuance requests. Second, he constitutionally asserts a due process denial under the\nfederal and state Constitutions. We reject these claims.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n        Flack's court-appointed defense team changed during pretrial when his initial lead\nattorney withdrew in July 2015 and had to be replaced. Flack moved to continue the trial,\nclaiming the defense will not be prepared for a September trial and asked to postpone\nuntil next year. The court granted the motion and continued the trial to February 22,\n2016.\n\n\n        In November 2015, defense counsel filed a second motion to continue trial.\nCounsel argued the team's difficulty replacing the original attorney created a deficiency\nthat could compromise Flack's right to counsel. The team further noted it lacked\n                                           24\n\fsufficient time to review discovery and the complete investigation based on ABA\nGuidelines. See American Bar Association, American Bar Association Guidelines for the\nAppointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 31 Hofstra L.\nRev. 913, 920 (2003). The team indicated it was still developing its mitigation case. It\nhad identified family members central to Flack's \"social history\" but had not yet\ninterviewed them; some were out of state, while others were unwilling to meet with\ndefense counsel. It had hired experts in childhood development, forensic psychiatry, and\nprison adjustment, but the interviews were pending. And it was still collecting school,\nmedical, and psychiatric records. Finally, the team said its heavy caseloads were already\nhard to manage and would be compounded by the holidays.\n\n\n       The court heard the motion in late November ex parte and in camera. It\nacknowledged the team's difficulties but pointed out the case had been pending for about\ntwo years. Expressing frustration with the apparent lack of progress, it denied the request\nwithout the State's input as it was skeptical more time would materially aid the defense.\n\n\n       In January 2016, the defense renewed its motion, which was again heard by the\ncourt ex parte, in camera. Defense counsel reiterated the same concerns but highlighted\nthe need for a neuropsychologist to examine Flack and testify during the penalty phase.\nThe court denied the motion and pushed the defense to retain an expert. It asked the\ndefense to file a new continuance motion \"to clarify a little more succinctly the particular\nissues that prohibit you in proceeding.\" It said it would revisit the issue the next week.\n\n\n       When voir dire began the following week, the defense filed its third continuance\nmotion. The court heard the motion in camera after that day's questioning. Defense\ncounsel reiterated their concerns and noted the defense team had lost its administrative\nsupport. The court systematically worked through the concerns, focusing especially on\nthe efforts to retain experts. It said, \"[C]ertain issues . . . should have been taken care of\n                                                25\n\fquite [some time] ago.\" It perceived the defense's concerns as mainly being mitigation\npreparation and asked the defense to push forward over the two weeks remaining before\nthe scheduled opening statements. It also advised the defense to continue preparing its\nmitigation case during the guilt phase.\n\n\n       Toward the end of the week, the court returned to the continuance motion. By that\ntime, the defense had retained a neuropsychologist to begin work within a few weeks and\nwould take about a week to finish. The parties discussed a plan to push back the guilt\nphase to accommodate the expert and proposed the court complete voir dire and conduct\njury selection by February 17. The guilt phase would be pushed back to March 7, and the\npenalty phase to March 28. The court agreed, and the trial proceeded on that schedule.\nBut when the trial began, defense counsel asked for further postponement, saying only\n\"[w]e believe we've litigated this issue thoroughly.\" The court denied the request.\n\n\nStatutory challenge\u2014a reasonable time to prepare for trial\n\n\n       We review continuance denials for abuse of discretion. A court abuses its\ndiscretion when its action is unreasonable or based on an error of law or fact. The party\nasserting an abuse of discretion must demonstrate it. State v. Hillard, 315 Kan. 732, 760,\n511 P.3d 883 (2022). Here, Flack does not claim the district court erred based on an error\nof law or fact; our focus is whether the district court erred by acting unreasonably.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3401 requires all persons charged with a crime to be tried without\nunnecessary delay and, at the same time, allows a district court to continue proceedings\nwhen good cause is shown. In addition, K.S.A. 22-3406 entitles a defendant to \"a\nreasonable time to prepare for trial.\" Flack alleges he was denied a reasonable time to\nprepare his case.\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       The ABA Guidelines thoroughly outline recommendations for defense counsel's\nduties in all aspects of death penalty cases. Flack relies almost exclusively on the\nguidelines and argues those obligations made his case especially time consuming,\njustifying his requested continuances. Generally, capital cases have \"extraordinary\ncomplexity and demands\" compared to noncapital cases. ABA Guidelines, 31 Hofstra L.\nRev. at 921. For example, capital cases increase defense counsel's obligations to\ninvestigate mitigators. See generally 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 924-28. In addition, counsel\nshould \"at all stages of the case . . . make every appropriate effort to establish a\nrelationship of trust with the client, and should maintain close contact with the client.\"\nABA Guideline 10.5. Counsel also must \"conduct thorough and independent\ninvestigations relating to the issues of both guilt and penalty.\" ABA Guideline 10.7(A).\nAnd counsel must consider and assert all potential legal claims at both the guilt and\npenalty phases and each claim's costs and benefits. ABA Guideline 10.8.\n\n\n       The ABA Guidelines are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim in a capital case, but they are not \"coextensive with\nconstitutional requirements.\" State v. Cheatham, 296 Kan. 417, 433, 292 P.3d 318\n(2013). The guidelines and their comments are useful to gauge what is \"a reasonable time\nto prepare for trial\" under K.S.A. 22-3406, and how a district court should exercise\ndiscretion when deciding whether to grant a continuance. The concern is not whether\ncounsel satisfied the guidelines, but rather whether, in considering various circumstances\npresented in a particular case, including the guidelines, the district court gave the defense\nreasonable time to prepare for trial. Granted, the guidelines can contextualize the\nproblems facing capital defense counsel, but caselaw ultimately governs whether a\ncontinuance denial rises to an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n       In State v. Robinson, 303 Kan. 11, 363 P.3d 875 (2015), disapproved of on other\ngrounds by State v. Cheever, 306 Kan. 760, 402 P.3d 1126 (2017), for example, we found\n                                          27\n\fno abuse of discretion in a district court's denial of continuances in a capital murder case\nafter comparing it to other similar cases. See 303 Kan. at 92-93 (listing cases). There, we\nacknowledged retained counsel's withdrawal \"certainly increased appointed counsel's\nworkload and responsibility\" but noted \"they were not starting from scratch.\" 303 Kan. at\n92. At the time of the withdrawal, counsel had been working for seven months. And the\ndistrict judge granted Robinson a continuance, giving newly appointed counsel another\nseven months to prepare. \"Appointed counsel also had the benefit of the preparation\n[prior counsel] had done over the course of nearly 2 years.\" 303 Kan. at 92. The Robinson\ncourt held \"the district judge properly exercised his lawful discretion by refusing requests\nfor a second continuance to prepare the guilt phase defense,\" reasoning a reasonable fact-\nfinder could have agreed with that ruling. 303 Kan. at 93; see also State v. Green, 315\nKan. 178, 179-80, 505 P.3d 377 (2022) (\"A court abuses its discretion if its action . . . 'is\n. . . unreasonable, i.e., if no reasonable person would have taken the view adopted by the\ntrial court.'\").\n\n\n        In Flack's case, almost two years and 10 months elapsed between his initial\ncounsel entering an appearance and trial. Nearly two years passed between his second\ncounsel entering an appearance and trial, and almost a full year passed between his third\ncounsel entering her appearance and trial. Initial and second counsel worked together for\nabout one year and three months, and the remaining counsel worked together for about\n250 days before trial after initial counsel retired in July 2015.\n\n\n        The first continuance request relied on the ABA Guidelines and focused on initial\ncounsel's withdrawal, remaining counsel's other caseload and inexperience in capital\ncases, the volume of discovery to review, and the need to retain expert witnesses. The\ncourt granted the continuance, mostly based on the original counsel's withdrawal.\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\f       Flack requested a second continuance so counsel could provide Flack \"with the\nhigh-quality legal representation contemplated under prevailing Constitutional and\nprofessional standards.\" The motion again cited the ABA Guidelines and highlighted\ndefense counsel's independent duty to investigate. The defense noted it had recently\nreceived \"20,000 pages and 500 discs\" of discovery and \"more than 100 scientific\nreports\" from the State. They were also waiting on their own experts' reports. The court\ndeferred ruling and asked the defense to push forward and keep it apprised of problems as\nthey arose.\n\n\n       The third continuance remained much the same as the second. The defense filed it\nat the court's request during voir dire to reflect the previously raised issues' status. The\ndefense was still reviewing and synthesizing discovery and conducting its investigation.\nBut the most pressing issue was securing a neuropsychologist, which the defense did on\nFebruary 4. The court, with the State's agreement, pushed the trial's start date from\nFebruary 22 to March 7 to allow the expert to evaluate Flack.\n\n\n       We discern no abuse of discretion in denying the second and third continuance\nrequests. As in Robinson, Flack's initial counsel was a single member of a three-counsel\nteam. He left second counsel with over a year on the case and a third counsel who joined\nthe team a few months earlier. Similarly, original counsel's withdrawal did not require the\nteam to start from scratch. Recognizing second counsel could not just pick up where\noriginal counsel left off, the court granted a continuance of several months. As to the\nsecond request, the court pushed the defense to make progress and pointedly questioned\nwhat aspects were challenging. Over the next months, the outstanding tasks narrowed,\neven as the defense continued to press for postponement. The largest obstacle, needing a\nneuropsychologist, became clear as trial approached, and the court granted a short\ncontinuance.\n\n\n                                              29\n\f       Throughout this process, the record reflects the court seriously considered the\ndefense's concerns and worked to address them as they arose. It reasonably handled the\ncase and did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\nConstitutional challenge\u2014right to present a defense\n\n\n       Flack argues the denial of his second and third continuance requests violated his\nright to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nand under sections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. We reject these\narguments.\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment states: \"[T]he accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and\npublic trial, by an impartial jury . . . ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to\nhave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.\" Section 5 declares: \"The right of trial by jury shall be\ninviolate.\" And section 10 \"allow[s]\" the accused to\n\n\n       \"appear and defend in person, or by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the\n       accusation against him; to meet the witness face to face, and to have compulsory process\n       to compel the attendance of the witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an\n       impartial jury . . . . No person shall be a witness against himself, or be twice put in\n       jeopardy for the same offense.\"\n\n\n       The phrase \"right to present a defense\" is a blanket term for a collection of a\ndefendant's rights, including a right to present evidence on his or her own behalf. See\nState v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, 207-08, 331 P.3d 544 (2014) (R. Carr I) (discussing nature of\n\"right to present a defense,\" focusing on rules for excluding evidence and right to present\ntheory of defense), rev'd and remanded on other grounds 577 U.S. 108, 136 S. Ct. 633,\n\n                                                    30\n\f193 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2016); United States v. Markey, 393 F.3d 1132, 1135 (10th Cir. 2004)\n(a defendant's \"right to present a defense\" refers to the collective rights \"to testify, present\nwitnesses in his own defense, and to cross-examine witnesses against him\" rooted in the\nFifth and Sixth Amendments). In some contexts, a continuance denial may implicate\nrights under the umbrella of \"right to present a defense.\" See Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S.\n1, 11-12, 103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1983) (\"[A]rbitrary 'insistence upon\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay' violates the right to the\nassistance of counsel.\").\n\n\n       The United States Supreme Court provides a \"continuance is traditionally within\nthe discretion of the trial judge.\" Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11\nL. Ed. 2d 921 (1964). When a request is reasonable, a continuance denial may\n\"myopic[ally] insist[] upon expeditiousness . . . render[ing] the right to defend with\ncounsel an empty formality.\" 376 U.S. at 589. The Court conceded, \"There are no\nmechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate\n[the accused's constitutional rights],\" but it noted, \"The answer must be found in the\ncircumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial\njudge at the time the request is denied.\" 376 U.S. at 589.\n\n\n       We review a continuance denial's possible interference with the right to present a\ndefense de novo. See Robinson, 303 Kan. at 85. Like the Ungar Court found the answer\nin the circumstances, we examine various factors present in a particular case. In State v.\nAnthony, 257 Kan. 1003, 898 P.2d 1109 (1995), a defendant contended the trial court\ndenied him his right to retain chosen counsel by failing to grant a continuance so that his\nretained counsel could prepare for his case. When rejecting his constitutional claim, the\nAnthony court considered several factors, including whether other continuances have\nbeen granted; whether legitimate reasons were shown to postpone trial; and whether\ndenial of the continuance would prejudice the defendant. The Anthony court held the trial\n                                           31\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance in which the sole reason for\nthe continuance was to permit new counsel to enter his appearance. 257 Kan. at 1019.\nHere, the trial began some eight months after his original counsel withdrew, and Flack\nproceeded with the same appointed counsel team he had all along. Moreover, the district\ncourt gave counsel reasonable time to prepare a capital case given the defense team's\nrelative continuity and the total time available.\n\n\n       We hold the district court's handling of continuance requests did not violate\nFlack's Sixth Amendment right to present a defense or his rights under sections 5 and 10\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.\n\n\n                   DENIAL OF FOR-CAUSE CHALLENGES TO SITTING JURORS\n\n\n       Throughout voir dire, the district court denied several defense for-cause challenges\nto selected jury members. These challenges questioned prospective jurors' predisposition\nto the death penalty. Some challenged members joined the 20 jurors and alternates who\nheard the case, and some of those joined the 12 who convicted Flack and sentenced him\nto death. On appeal, Flack argues the district court committed reversible error by denying\nhis challenges. Again, we disagree.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n       When voir dire began, the court separated prospective jurors into six panels. It\nquestioned two panels per day over nine days to reduce the initial group from which the\nparties could exercise peremptory challenges. Each party received 20 peremptory\nchallenges to produce a final jury of 20, including eight alternates.\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\f       During peremptory challenges, defense counsel asked for \"extra strikes\" because\nthe court denied so many of the defense's for-cause challenges. The court ruled this was\npremature since the defense had not yet exhausted all of its peremptory strikes. After\nexercising its seventeenth peremptory challenge, the defense renewed its request for more\nstrikes. The State opposed this for two reasons. First, the defense still had some\nperemptory strikes. Second, procedurally it was unclear where the new strikes would\ncome from because alternate jurors were necessary. The court denied the request,\nreasoning the defense had already struck the only juror who was arguably \"automatic\ndeath.\" The defense then formally objected to the 20 selected jurors' composition. The\ncourt randomly selected alternate jurors but did not disclose to the jury who it selected\nuntil deliberations.\n\n\n       When trial began, the court released three jurors after each raised an issue,\nbringing the jury down to 17. Before deliberations, the court named the alternates, and\nthe 12 primary jurors deliberated and ultimately entered guilty verdicts.\n\n\n       Prior to the penalty phase, the court conducted a second voir dire at the defense's\npretrial request to determine whether any jurors, including the alternates, had reached an\nopinion on a death sentence. The jurors were questioned individually, outside the\npresence of the others. The court asked five questions and then allowed follow-up\nquestions by the State and defense.\n\n\n       Juror J.B.'s responses during questioning raised concerns when he expressed\nreluctance to change his mind about imposing the death penalty. While claiming he\nwould follow the law and consider all mitigating circumstances, his skepticism persisted.\nAfter questioning the other jurors, the defense asked to remove two potential jurors,\nincluding J.B. Given J.B.'s role as part of the 12-member jury that convicted Flack, the\ncourt removed J.B. But it retained the other juror as being an alternate.\n                                             33\n\f       On appeal, Flack lists 18 potential jurors denied a for-cause challenge. But Flack\nused peremptory challenges to remove 16 of those 18.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review for-cause juror challenges for an abuse of discretion because the trial\njudge is better positioned to make the ruling. Robinson, 303 Kan. at 154. \"Appellate\ncourts have traditionally accorded a great deal of deference to a trial court's ruling on a\njuror challenge for cause.\" State v. Miller, 308 Kan. 1119, 1138, 427 P.3d 907 (2018).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3410(1) permits a party to \"challenge any prospective juror for cause.\"\nAmong the nine grounds listed in K.S.A. 22-3410(2) is: \"(i) His state of mind with\nreference to the case or any of the parties is such that the court determines there is doubt\nthat he can act impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party.\" In\ndeath penalty cases, prospective jurors may be excluded when their views on the death\npenalty \"would 'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror.'\"\nWainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985). This\napplies whether the challenge is directed at death-leaning or life-leaning jurors. R. Carr I,\n300 Kan. 1, Syl. \u00b6 20. The pertinent question for our appellate review is not whether we\nagree with the district judge's ruling but, instead, whether the record fairly supports its\nruling. Robinson, 303 Kan. at 155.\n\n\n       Of the 18 jurors Flack discusses, only M.F. and J.H. ended up as jurors. And as the\nState correctly notes, the relevant question is whether the seated jurors prejudiced Flack.\nSee Miller, 308 Kan. at 1138 (failing to excuse a juror for cause requires conviction\n                                            34\n\freversal only when the defendant demonstrates he or she was prejudiced as a result).\nEven if a defendant was compelled to use peremptory challenges \"to correct erroneous\nfor-cause rulings,\" it is a nonissue absent the defendant showing the sitting jury was\nprejudiced. 308 Kan. at 1139. Flack, as the party asserting the error, bears the burden of\nestablishing the denial of a for-cause challenge constituted an abuse of discretion and\nresulted in prejudice. 308 Kan. at 1138.\n\n\nJuror M.F.\n\n\n       During the State's initial voir dire, the prosecutor asked M.F. about her general\nviews on the death penalty. In the past, M.F. strongly supported the death penalty without\nmuch knowledge. But after working for a judge who opposed it, she reevaluated her\nstance. She said the judge told her that \"many people are in prison that later they're found\nnot guilty.\" She then noted, \"I need to be open to hearing all of the information and\nunderstanding the whole story before I can say strongly one way or the other.\"\n\n\n       During defense questioning, M.F. said she would consider factors such as the\ndegree of the childhood abuse or the mental illness, as well as a person's adaptability to\nprison, as potential mitigating circumstances. But she \"need[ed] more information to\nmake a decision.\" Counsel further asked about her shifting death penalty views. She\nreiterated, \"I don't feel strongly one way or the other about the death penalty. But it\ndefinitely is going to have to be very clear [that the defendant is guilty.]\"\n\n\n       In her questionnaire, M.F. suggested childhood experience \"plays a huge role\" but\nshould not affect capital sentencing. She believed individuals must take responsibility for\ntheir choices and must not blame others. M.F. noted she would consider factors \"more\nserious than [abuse or unloved]\" necessary to warrant capital punishment.\n\n\n                                              35\n\f       The defense challenged M.F. for cause, focusing on her questionnaire response\nsuggesting the death penalty was appropriate in a multiple victim case \"if there's\nabsolutely no question about [the] person's guilt.\" She \"equivocate[d]\" in her written\nresponses about her beliefs and opinions on the death penalty, which defense counsel\nclaimed made it \"hard to draw out any information what her thoughts are.\" The defense\ncharacterized her responses as \"it depends.\" Counsel argued M.F. conveyed believing\npeople must take personal responsibility for their actions created a \"mitigation\nimpairment with her.\" Ultimately, \"there's a doubt that she could be impartial.\"\n\n\n       The court rejected this, reasoning M.F. appeared to be more favorable to the\ndefense than some jurors the defense previously challenged. M.F. affirmed she had not\nformed an opinion on Flack's guilt from media or pretrial sources. The court emphasized\nher evolving beliefs about the death penalty and her \"conscientious\" approach, expressing\nfaith in her ability to be fair, impartial, and law-abiding at sentencing.\n\n\n       In his brief, Flack argues M.F. dismissed the importance of extreme childhood\nexperiences and said mercy would play no role in her penalty decision. He contends her\nstance, even after agreeing to follow the law, is \"devastating\" to a fair penalty trial, as her\n\"willingness to follow the law does not prevent long held biases from affecting a\nverdict.\"\n\n\n       But contrary to Flack's contention, during voir dire, M.F. consistently expressed\nshe could not definitively answer how various factors would weigh in her decision-\nmaking process without knowing more. She clarified her questionnaire response,\nexplaining that while she would not be swayed by typical childhood traumas, she would\nconsider more serious circumstances. The record shows M.F. was open to mitigation\nevidence, and her reservation about childhood experiences pertains more to their abstract\npersuasiveness rather than a complete rejection.\n                                            36\n\f       Finally, Flack seemingly argues a juror is biased if he or she is unwilling to rely on\nthe nebulous concept of mercy alone for mitigation. But he cites no support for this. As\nJustice Scalia once noted, \"what one juror might consider mitigating another might not.\nAnd of course the ultimate question whether mitigating circumstances outweigh\naggravating circumstances is mostly a question of mercy\u2014the quality of which, as we\nknow, is not strained.\" Kansas v. Carr, 577 U.S. 108, 119, 136 S. Ct. 633, 193 L. Ed. 2d\n535 (2016). So even if M.F. said \"mercy\"\u2014a concept she equated with \"pity\" during voir\ndire\u2014should not be considered on her questionnaire, she remained willing to consider the\nvarious circumstances in Flack's case before reaching a decision.\n\n\n       Rather than showing a preformed bias favoring the death penalty, M.F.'s voir dire\nresponses consistently reflected a willingness to wait and see the evidence before\ndeciding, which is exactly what a juror should do. The court scrutinized her qualifications\nand outlined its reasons why she was a qualified juror. As it pointed out, given her\nhesitation about the death penalty, if anything, M.F. was a favorable defense juror. It was\nneither error nor an abuse of discretion for the court to deny this challenge.\n\n\nJuror J.H.\n\n\n       During voir dire, J.H. reiterated a neutral view on the death penalty, expressing a\ncommitment to base his decision on the case's facts and the court's instructions. He\nacknowledged \"there's no rehabilitation\" for some people but noted sometimes \"people\nget into situations\" and there are \"so many hypothetical situations out there.\" J.H.\nrecognized the weighty responsibility of imposing the death penalty, underscoring the\nneed for certainty in such decisions.\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f         On his questionnaire, J.H. indicated a belief that mercy should not play a role in\nsentencing. And when asked whether he believed in an \"eye for an eye,\" his answer was,\n\"Let the punishment fit the crime.\" During voir dire, when questioned about his \"eye for\nan eye\" response, he explained he could envision \"a hypothetical situation\" in which a\ncrime is \"so horrific\" that he could support the death penalty. But he acknowledged the\ndeath penalty is not suitable for every murder case, although it is \"there for a reason\" and\nthere are situations in which it can be used. J.H. admitted that until he learned the juror's\nrole during this process, he had not deeply considered his stance on the death penalty.\n\n\n         Following the conclusion of J.H.'s panel, defense counsel challenged him for cause\nbased on his questionnaire responses. Counsel interpreted J.H.'s \"eye for an eye\" response\nas potentially shifting the burden to the defense to \"prove . . . that life without the\npossibility of parole was deserved.\" The court rejected this challenge, finding J.H.'s\nresponses indicated he has not yet made up his mind one way or the other and\ncharacterizing him as \"middle of the road\" on the death penalty. The court found no\nreason to doubt his fairness and impartiality during the guilt phase, and that he conveyed\na willingness to consider the mitigating circumstances if the case reached the penalty\nphase.\n\n\n         On appeal, Flack claims the district court abused its discretion by denying his for-\ncause challenge to J.H., because of his questionnaire responses: \"Let the punishment fit\nthe crime,\" and mercy should not be a factor in his decision-making. Flack continues that\nJ.H. \"harbor[ed] an unacceptable bias on a matter crucial for a fair proceeding,\" even if\nhe agreed to follow the law.\n\n\n         Nevertheless, like M.F., the record establishes J.H. would listen to the evidence\nand decide the case on the facts and law. And we hold the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying these challenges.\n                                              38\n\fJurors not challenged for cause\n\n\n       Besides M.F. and J.H., Flack argues three other seated jurors were similarly\nbiased: J.S., C.C., and G.B. He asserts both J.S. and C.C. expressed their belief that\nchildhood experiences and mercy were irrelevant considerations for determining\npunishment, citing only their questionnaire responses. For J.S. and C.C., Flack adds that\nalthough each agreed to consider childhood experiences during voir dire, the prosecution\nled them to agree only to \"consider\" mitigators, without committing to \"meaningful\nconsideration,\" potentially prejudicing the defense.\n\n\n       As for J.S., the defense questioning was cursory. When asked about his thoughts\non the death penalty, he replied he could impose it in some cases depending on the\nevidence. Similarly, when asked about his starting position for or against the death\npenalty, he stated he did not have an opinion until he considered the evidence. Defense\ncounsel asked each juror if they could \"consider mercy for that guilty murder\"; J.S.\nsimply replied, \"Yes.\" Counsel did not follow up. In fact, his response to most questions\nwas a simple yes or no. And he said he would follow and apply the law. When asked\nabout mitigating factors, he answered he would consider the evidence whether \"the\nperson really . . . [was] aware of what he was doing.\"\n\n\n       The State asked C.C. to elaborate on her questionnaire responses about the effect\nof childhood experiences. She elucidated upbringing may not always determine the\noutcome, but \"a loving, caring home\" increases the likelihood of the individuals \"turning\nout to be better people.\" Despite this, she acknowledged she had written that \"people are\nresponsible for their actions.\" The State followed by asking whether she could consider\nchildhood experiences as mitigating factors, C.C. replied people \"have to be accountable\n\n\n                                            39\n\ffor [their actions]\" but she \"would consider aggravating and mitigating\" factors and\n\"weigh them up\" in her decision-making process.\n\n\n       When questioned by defense counsel, C.C. acknowledged she placed greater\nimportance on the circumstances of killing in the context of aggravating and mitigating\nconsiderations. She confirmed \"the background of a person\" would not matter to her. But\nshe clarified a commitment to fairness and honesty in weighing these factors. After\nfurther questioning, C.C. agreed she would give the defense's mitigators weight, consider\nthem, and \"truly give [them] meaningful consideration.\"\n\n\n       As for G.B., Flack contends he \"expressed strong biases in favor of the death\npenalty, writing that he definitely favored the death penalty, if the murder of a mother\nand child were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" G.B. did not think childhood\nexperiences were relevant to capital punishment, as there was \"'no excuse for capital\nmurder.'\" Flack claims the \"upshot\" of G.B.'s agreement to \"consider\" childhood\nexperiences after saying they were not \"relevant\" on his questionnaire was \"that he would\nconsider them but not give them relevance.\"\n\n\n       On his questionnaire, G.B. acknowledged the role of upbringing in adult behavior\nbut maintained it did not excuse capital murder. The State asked whether his position\nchanged after he understood the process for imposing the death penalty; G.B. said he\nwould consider any mitigating circumstances he was instructed to consider. Defense\ncounsel gave G.B. a hypothetical of a conviction with various aggravators. Counsel asked\nhow jurors should view the death penalty before factoring in any mitigators. G.B.\nanswered, \"You have to look at the mitigators to get it on the scale and the aggravators\nwould have to outweigh the mitigators.\" Counsel characterized his questionnaire response\nabout the likelihood of imposing the death penalty for the premeditated capital murder of\na woman and child as \"almost automatic.\" But G.B. clarified that was not what he had\n                                          40\n\fmeant, \"[i]t depends on all the evidence presented.\" G.B. also noted that after he learned\n\"how the system works,\" he could consider childhood experiences as a mitigating\ncircumstance.\n\n\n       The State, of course, did not have a chance to rehabilitate the jurors because Flack\ndid not challenge them during the trial. Likewise, the court could not make a record for\nappellate review on each juror's ability to be fair and impartial. Thus, Flack's failure\nburdens our analysis.\n\n\n       Flack's cursory argument about these jurors' prejudices focuses on their limited\nresponses and matter-of-course agreement to apply the law as instructed. But the record\nestablishes trial counsel never probed deeper into the concerns appellate counsel now\nraises. Nothing shows these jurors were improperly prejudiced or biased against Flack.\nThe district court conducted voir dire carefully and cautiously, addressing the defense's\nconcerns seriously. The follow-up voir dire questioning either clarified or rehabilitated\neach juror's positions, so the court could reasonably conclude these jurors would be fair\nand impartial. We find no error.\n\n\n                           GUILT PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack asserts three instances of guilt-phase prosecutorial error that, individually\nand collectively, warrant conviction reversal. First, he claims the State's repeated use of\nthe expression \"level[ing] the scales\" during voir dire to describe the jury's role at\nsentencing negated the presumption of life in Kansas. Second, he argues the State's\nmention of Mother's Day during opening statements to describe the discovery of L.B.'s\nbody was inflammatory and meant to provoke juror sympathy. Third, he claims a\nbaseball analogy during the State's closing rebuttal argument gave an incorrect reasonable\ndoubt definition. We disagree.\n                                              41\n\fStandard of review\n\n\n       We review prosecutorial error claims in two steps: error and prejudice. First, we\ndetermine whether the alleged acts \"'fall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to\nconduct the State's case.'\" State v. Blansett, 309 Kan. 401, 412, 435 P.3d 1136 (2019).\nSecond, if we find error, we then \"'determine whether the error prejudiced the defendant's\ndue process rights to a fair trial.'\" 309 Kan. at 412. In the second step, we apply the\nconstitutional harmlessness standard laid out in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87\nS. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967), which demands the State show beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the prosecutorial error did not affect the trial's outcome in light of the entire\nrecord. In other words, the question is whether there is no reasonable possibility that the\nerror contributed to the verdict. Blansett, 309 Kan. at 412.\n\n\nLeveling the scales\n\n\n       Before each voir dire panel, the State consistently described the transition from the\nguilt phase to the penalty phase by using the colloquialism \"level[ing] the scales.\" In one\npanel, for example, the prosecutor told jurors they would once again hear the evidence\nand follow the judge's instructions. And based on the evidence and the law, the jury\nwould determine whether the sentence should be life without the possibility of parole or\nthe death penalty. The prosecutor illustrated the \"concept of the process\" as: \"You have a\nscale, you level the scale. . . . Then you consider the circumstances.\"\n\n\n       These included the statutory aggravating circumstances the State had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt on one side and the mitigating circumstances, which need not\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the other. The prosecutor told the panel, \"The\nweighing of circumstance is an individual determination\" \"based upon your own life\n                                           42\n\fexperiences, and your values.\" The prosecutor concluded if \"[t]he aggravators outweigh\nthe mitigators, imposition of the death penalty. If the mitigators outweigh the\naggravators, life without the possibility of parole. If they're equal, imposition of the death\npenalty.\" The prosecutor used a similar description with each panel.\n\n\n       In Kansas, our statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty requires a\nsentencing jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory aggravating\ncircumstance and, \"further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not\noutweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist.\" K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 21-6617(e). Under this scheme, if the aggravating circumstances and mitigating\ncircumstances are in \"equipoise,\" as we have termed it, the sentence is death. Kansas v.\nMarsh, 548 U.S. 163, 179, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006).\n\n\n       In Marsh, the defendant argued the equipoise provision \"establishes an\nunconstitutional presumption in favor of death.\" 548 U.S. at 166-67. But the Court\nrejected that argument and held it was constitutionally permissible for an equipoise\nweighing to result in a death sentence. In reaching that conclusion, the Court stated our\n\"sentencing system is dominated by the presumption that life imprisonment is the\nappropriate sentence for a capital conviction\" because it requires a life sentence if the\nState fails to meet its burden to prove an aggravating circumstance. 548 U.S. at 178.\nFlack argues the presumption of life the Court found \"dominated\" our system means the\n\"jury does not start with level scales.\" He asserts that because \"'level scales' is a more\ncolloquial term for equipoise,\" the prosecutor's language \"with every jury panel, and thus\nwith every seated juror,\" \"primed the jury to start from equipoise rather than the proper\npresumption of life.\"\n\n\n       We agree with Flack's premise that our capital sentencing scheme includes a\npresumption of life. But we do not agree with his conclusion that the prosecutor's\n                                           43\n\f\"level[ing] the scales\" phrasing contradicted that presumption or misstated the law. The\n\"default\" sentence after a capital conviction is a life sentence without the possibility of\nparole. And that default continues until the State proves, and the jury finds, an\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. It is only at that point the weighing\nprocess or \"scales\" come into play. The prosecutor's analogy did not misinform the jury\nand imply a presumption of death. Rather, it conveyed just the opposite: that the guilty\nverdict itself carried no weight in sentencing deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold the prosecutor's description of the deliberative process accurately\nexplained the State's burden to prove an aggravating circumstance and the weighing\nprocess that follows. The prosecutor's comments were not error.\n\n\nProsecutor's reference to Mother's Day\n\n\n       The State's opening statement made a single reference to Mother's Day before\ndescribing law enforcement's discovery of L.B.'s body: \"In just a few hours it will be\nMother's Day. It's May 11th, 2013. And at this point in the evening the sun has set,\ndarkness has fallen, and there's a group of officers and they're huddled together on a\nbridge.\" Flack argues the fact it was almost Mother's Day was immaterial and meant to\ninflame the jurors' sympathies. We disagree.\n\n\n       Prosecutors have wide latitude when crafting opening and closing statements, so\nlong as their statements \"'accurately reflect the evidence, accurately state the law, and\ncannot be \"intended to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury or to divert the jury\nfrom its duty to decide the case based on the evidence and the controlling law.\"'\" State v.\nBodine, 313 Kan. 378, 406, 486 P.3d 551 (2021). When deciding whether a prosecutor's\nstatement falls outside the wide latitude given, we consider \"'the context in which the\nstatement was made, rather than analyzing the statement in isolation.'\" 313 Kan. at 407.\n                                           44\n\f       In State v. Henry, 273 Kan. 608, 640, 44 P.3d 466 (2002), the court determined a\nprosecutor's comment to \"'think about Mother's Day yesterday, and her mom how she\nmust have felt. Now [the victim] will never have a chance to be a mother, this young\nprofessional sharp, security conscious woman . . . .'\" The Henry court noted, \"The\nprosecutor's reference to the mother's grief and the introduction of the mother's testimony\nwas not relevant to whether the defendant was afflicted by mental disease or defect at the\ntime of the alleged crimes. The prosecutor clearly intended to inflame the passion and\nprejudice of the jury.\" 273 Kan. at 641; cf. State v. Chandler, 307 Kan. 657, 690, 414\nP.3d 713 (2018) (prosecutor stated defendant \"'robbed her own children of their father'\"\nand elicited sympathy for the children).\n\n\n       But the prosecutor's reference to Mother's Day here is distinguishable from Henry.\nThe prosecutor was painting a scene describing law enforcement's discovery of L.B.'s\nbody that included many details not necessary to the case, such as describing the cool\nspring evening and use of flashlights. The only reference to Mother's Day was followed\nby 11 days of testimony and evidence, so its alleged appeal to passion seems overblown.\nThe State never mentioned it again. Nor did it ever imply finding L.B.'s body just before\nMother's Day was any worse or more tragic than any other day. The comment was within\nthe wide latitude given to prosecutors in crafting an opening statement and not error.\n\n\nBaseball analogy\n\n\n       Flack's final guilt-phase prosecutorial error challenge is to a Chicago Cubs\nanalogy the prosecutor used in rebuttal closing argument. The prosecutor stated:\n\n\n               \"We've not asked you to ignore anything. What we've asked you to do is look at\n       the totality, look at all of it. When you consider the defendant's actions before the crime,\n\n                                                    45\n\f       during the crime, after the crime. When you consider the defendant's words, his\n       statements about what happened. And then you take that and you consider other witness\n       observations, the physical and scientific evidence, when you look at all of that, all of that\n       leads to one conclusion. It's him. It's no one else. It's simply him. No matter how many\n       times, no matter how many ways, the defendant's version that there were other people\n       involved is simply not supported by evidence.\n\n\n               \"You know in terms of possibility, every February I'm a happy man. I'm a happy\n       man because on February 15th it's the start of spring training and as a lifelong Chicago\n       Cubs fan, I am filled with hope because it is possible, it is possible that this could be the\n       Cubs year. But inevitably, inevitably sometimes by June, sometimes late August, it is no\n       longer possible that it's going to be the Cubs year. I'll keep my fingers crossed in terms of\n       the season. I'll keep superstitions and I'll have to go spit in the river now or something.\n       But there's always possibilities, but there comes a point, just like in baseball that at some\n       point in the season it's no longer possible that our team is going to win the pennant or our\n       team is going to go to the World Series.\n\n\n               \"There comes a point when it is not possible and it's not possible because it's not\n       supported by hard evidence. And the hard evidence, the circumstantial evidence here, all\n       overwhelmingly points to one person and one person alone.\"\n\n\n       Flack argues this analogy improperly sought to define reasonable doubt akin to the\npuzzle analogy disapproved of in State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 115-18, 378 P.3d 1060\n(2016). Again, we disagree.\n\n\n       In Sherman, the State showed a PowerPoint slide depicting Mount Rushmore with\nTheodore Roosevelt's face removed. The slide contained the question, \"'Do you have a\nREASONABLE DOUBT this is Mt. Rushmore??'\" and, \"'Even though you can't see all\nfour figures!!'\" 305 Kan. at 96. We disapproved because this analogy \"improperly\nequated a juror's prior knowledge about the picture being displayed to his or her 'life\nexperience.'\" 305 Kan. at 116. It inappropriately \"foster[ed] the illusion that the jurors\n                                                    46\n\falready know the full picture of the case they are hearing and are simply looking for\npieces of evidence to match it.\" 305 Kan. at 116. Contrary to that implication, \"we insist\nthat jurors have minimal to no prior knowledge of a case precisely to prevent them from\nseeking evidence to confirm a preconceived narrative and conclusion.\" 305 Kan. at 116.\n\n\n       Flack argues the baseball analogy just substitutes baseball wins and losses for\npieces of a puzzle. He argues the prosecutor was telling the jury it did not need to see the\nfull season play out and could turn off the TV and assume the worst \"based on their\nknowledge of how such things usually go.\" But one obvious problem with his argument\nis that the analogy does not attempt to describe reasonable doubt, let alone define it. The\nprosecution does not mention reasonable doubt until later, when it still does not try to\ndefine it.\n\n\n       Based on the context, this permissibly appealed to the jury's common sense to\nevaluate the weaknesses in Flack's case. See State v. Butler, 307 Kan. 831, 867-68, 416\nP.3d 116 (2018) (permissible for prosecution to say the defendant's version of events was\nridiculous, not believable). The prosecutor specifically mentioned Flack's claim that more\npeople were involved and used baseball to argue the evidence does not support that. He\nseems to have been saying that at some point, based on how a baseball season works, a\nteam might have so many losses it simply cannot win the season\u2014it is not possible to get\nto the World Series. By analogy, the prosecutor pointed out there was more than enough\ncontrary evidence to show Flack's version was impossible. We hold this was not error.\n\n\n       We find no prosecutorial error during the trial's guilt phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f                         PENALTY-PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack alleges three prosecutorial errors that occurred in the penalty-phase closing\narguments. He claims the prosecutor erred by (1) repeatedly asking the jury to consider,\n\"What is justice?\" (2) stating facts not in evidence when he implied Flack could access\nmental health treatment in prison and stated Flack's family would be \"healed\" regardless\nof the sentence, and (3) improperly interjecting opinion into the case by suggesting as a\n\"seasoned prosecutor\" he knew the death penalty was appropriate here. We hold no error\noccurred.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       Our standard of review for prosecutorial error claims in the penalty phase largely\nremains unchanged from the guilt phase, although, in a capital murder trial, a prosecutor\nhas a \"'heightened duty'\" to refrain from committing error due to \"'the life and death\nnature of the proceedings.'\" State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, 315, 382 P.3d 373 (2016)\n(Kleypas II). If there are multiple prosecutorial errors, the inquiry \"'is whether the total\neffect of the cumulative [errors] found to exist, viewed in light of the record as a whole,\nhad little, if any, likelihood [or any reasonable possibility] of changing the jury's ultimate\nconclusion regarding the weight of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.'\" 305\nKan. at 315.\n\n\n\"What is justice?\"\n\n\n       Flack challenges the prosecutor repeatedly asking, \"What is justice?\" during\nopening and closing statements. His opening statement began and ended with this theme:\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\f           \"The penalty phase, it's a narrow band of cases in Kansas that require this\nlitigation. There has been a capital murder conviction. The elected law enforcement\nofficial from this county, Mr. [Prosecutor], has decided that twelve well-vetted jurors\nfrom the county where the crime occurred should decide this: What is justice? What is\njustice?\n\n\n           ....\n\n\n           \"The core issue comes down to this: Once the arguments are over, you're in the\njury room, deliberations have begun, the foreperson receives the instructions.\n\n\n           \"The question will become: Abiding by the instructions that you're given,\nconsidering the facts and the circumstances that you have found to exist, each of you will\nhave to ask yourself, what is appropriate justice?\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show . . . a twenty-one year old mother that before the trigger\nwas pulled, and the contents of a PDX round tore through her brain, the evidence will\nshow that she was stripped from the waist down. The evidence will show that she's\nunable to hold those who are around her because her hands are tied, bound behind her\nback.\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that she is unable to verbalize to those who are around\nher because her mouth is gagged. The evidence will show that she is unable to clearly see\nwhat is around her because her glasses have been taken off.\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that all she's left with is this: She can feel, smell, and\nhear. She can feel the carpet on her face. She can feel the air on her naked legs and\nbuttocks. She is breathing the air in that master bedroom. And she is hearing the\nfootsteps, the footsteps of those around her. The words and the sounds of those around\nher. What is appropriate justice? What is appropriate justice?\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that [K.B.'s] eighteen month old child, [L.B.], standing\nby her dead mother's body. The evidence will show that the trigger was pulled and the\n                                               49\n\f         contents of that PDX round tore through her small torso. What is appropriate justice?\n         What is appropriate justice?\n\n\n                 \"Life without the possibility of parole, imposition of the death penalty? It is for\n         you to decide.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         At the end of the State's pre-rebuttal closing, the prosecutor briefly returned to this\ntheme:\n\n\n                 \"The core issue in this case, abiding by the instructions given to you, considering\n         the facts and the circumstance that you have found to exist. Each of you will have to ask\n         . . . yourself this: What is appropriate justice? What is appropriate justice? A 21 year\n         old mother shot in the back of the head, followed by her 18 month old child shot in the\n         back. You have to make a decision, what is appropriate justice? What is appropriate\n         justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the possibility of parole? That\n         decision is for you to make.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         Flack compares these comments to disapproved prosecutorial appeals to justice\nand sympathy. See, e.g., State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 996-99, 336 P.3d 312 (2014). Flack\nargues \"the prosecutor was clearly asking, 'What is justice for them?'\" The State counters\nhe takes the comments out of context\u2014the prosecutor correctly set forth the penalty\nphase procedures, and he never asked the jury to return a death verdict or argued it would\nbe appropriate. Even so, Flack asserts the comments \"distracted the jury\" from its duty to\ndecide the case on the facts and the law, as given by the judge.\n\n\n         We disagree. In Holt, we determined a prosecutor erred by \"stating that the jury\nhas the 'privilege . . . to right a wrong,' and '[y]ou and only you can right the wrong that\nthe defendant has committed in taking a young man's life.'\" Holt, 300 Kan. at 999. The\nremarks were \"akin to asking the jury to administer justice for the victim\" rather than \"a\ngeneral appeal for justice.\" 300 Kan. at 999. And we noted the prosecutor \"'divert[ed] the\n                                             50\n\fjury from the evidence so as to obtain a conviction based upon sympathy for the victim.'\"\n300 Kan. at 998.\n\n\n       Our pre-Holt caselaw similarly distinguished between a general appeal for justice\nand an appeal for a jury to do justice for the criminal victims, although these cases\ngenerally declined to draw a bright line. See, e.g., State v. Britt, 295 Kan. 1018, 1030-31,\n287 P.3d 905 (2012) (prosecutor's request for the jury to \"'do the right thing, here, find\nhim guilty'\" was \"more aptly characterized as a general appeal for justice that was not\nexplicitly tied to the community or the victim\"); State v. Simmons, 292 Kan. 406, 419,\n254 P.3d 97 (2011) (\"[A] prosecutor commits misconduct during closing argument when,\nin effect, he or she asks the jury to base its deliberations on sympathy for the victim or\nvictim's family or to otherwise argue the impact of a crime on a victim or victim's\nfamily.\"); State v. Martinez, 290 Kan. 992, 1015, 236 P.3d 481 (2010) (prosecutor's\n\"comment urging the jury to tell A.G. 'she did the right thing' by reporting the incident\"\nwas improper \"because it appealed to the jurors' parental instincts and diverted their\nattention from the evidence and the law\"); State v. Nguyen, 285 Kan. 418, 425-26, 172\nP.3d 1165 (2007) (noting a possible \"distinction when the argument is asking for justice\nfor the specific victim\" but speculating that \"[p]erhaps the touchstone is whether the\nargument seeks to divert the jury from the evidence\" with \"sympathy for the victim\"; in\nany event, a prosecutorial request for justice is permissible where \"the prosecutor's\nargument was largely evidence based, notwithstanding an underlying promotion of\nawareness for the victim\" \"coupled with the admonition against sympathy and\nprejudice\"); State v. Ruff, 252 Kan. 625, 631-36, 847 P.2d 1258 (1993) (prosecutorial\nexhortation for the jury to \"'not allow this conduct to be tolerated in our county'\"\nconstituted reversible prosecutorial misconduct).\n\n\n       Likewise, the post-Holt cases continue to recognize potential prosecutorial error\nby improperly eliciting sympathy. See, e.g., State v. Gallegos, 313 Kan. 262, 276, 485\n                                            51\n\fP.3d 622 (2021) (prosecutor's statements permissible because they did not appeal to jury's\nsympathy, did not ask the jury to place itself in the victim's position, and did not ask for\njustice for the victim); Chandler, 307 Kan. at 690 (comment urging for conviction\nbecause \"'she robbed her own children of their father and his fianc[\u00e9e]'\" erroneous). But\nhere, the prosecutor was not arguing for a conviction; the jury already returned a guilty\nverdict. Nor did the prosecutor ever directly ask the jury to return a death sentence or\nsuggest that such a sentence was appropriate.\n\n\n       Indeed, the prosecutor began opening arguments with the facially neutral\nstatement that \"twelve well-vetted jurors from the county where the crime occurred\nshould decide this: What is justice?\" And the prosecutor concluded his pre-rebuttal\nclosing on a similar open-ended note: \"You have to make a decision, what is appropriate\njustice? What is appropriate justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the\npossibility of parole? That decision is for you to make.\" Flack's prosecutor did not ask for\njustice for the victims\u2014he acceptably told the jurors their job was to determine a just\nsentence.\n\n\nMental health treatment and family healing\n\n\n       Flack next argues the prosecutor erred by commenting on facts outside the\nevidence when he \"implied to the jury\" Flack would receive mental health treatment and\nhis family \"would be 'healed' if he were sentenced to death.\" Flack asserts no evidence\nshows that. But these characterizations are not entirely accurate:\n\n\n               \"Over this time you've seen the sadness. Sadness can also be healing, healing.\n       Because there's something about a case like this that when you expose bad things to the\n       light, there's healing. There's healing.\n\n\n\n                                                  52\n\f               \"You know, for the healing for the Flack family, that can occur whether there's\n       the long journey towards execution or the long journey towards natural death. That\n       healing doesn't stop with whatever your decision is. And during that journey hopefully\n       Mr. Flack will get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health issues.\"\n\n\n       \"A prosecutor is prohibited from arguing facts not in evidence, but generally has\nwide latitude to make arguments based on reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented at trial.\" State v. Novotny, 297 Kan. 1174, 1189, 307 P.3d 1278 (2013). Here,\nFlack advances little argument beyond pointing to the statements themselves and offering\nconclusions, and he cites just one case, Chandler, 307 Kan. 657. But in Chandler, a\nprosecutor committed reversible error when she told the jury a nonexistent protection\nfrom abuse order had been filed against the defendant and repeatedly hammered that\nfabricated fact during her closing. 307 Kan. at 678-84. That case hardly supports Flack.\n\n\n       Flack's characterizations are overstated. First, the prosecutor's mental health\ncomments presented only hope and desire, not fact, when he said, \"[H]opefully Mr. Flack\nwill get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health.\" (Emphasis added.) He\ndid not tell the jury Flack would receive mental health treatment, nor did he even suggest\nit was likely. And as the State points out, the record supports a reasonable inference that\nmental health treatment might be available based on testimony Flack previously received\nit in jail and prison. Second, the prosecutor's statements about Flack's family did not\npromise healing, just that whatever healing they may experience would happen during\n\"the long journey towards execution or . . . natural death\" and that \"healing doesn't stop\"\nno matter the jury's decision. At most, this statement tried to convince the jury that\nsympathy for Flack's family should not weigh heavily in its deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold neither statement was erroneous. The prosecutor did not impermissibly\nstate facts outside of evidence during closing.\n\n                                                   53\n\fSelf-reference as \"seasoned prosecutor\" and suggesting, \"If not this case, what case?\"\n\n       Finally, Flack claims the prosecutor improperly bolstered himself as a \"seasoned\nprosecutor\" and offered his opinion that this case warranted the death penalty. The State\ncounters the prosecutor properly requested jurors determine an appropriate sentence\ngiven the facts, instructions, and weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The\nprosecutor said:\n\n\n               \"I ask you to take [Defense]'s argument into consideration. And I hope after all\n       this that the attorneys in this case have represented our professional best.\n\n\n               \"At the end of it, it comes down to what is justice? What is justice? Taking into\n       account all of the instructions, abiding by those instructions, looking at all the facts and\n       circumstances you found to exist.\n\n\n               \"There is a dead 21 year old mother shot in the back of the head, bound and\n       gagged with her 18 month old daughter in that room. Then there's that 18 month old\n       daughter that is shot in the back. These cases are difficult on everyone. The question is,\n       what is justice for that scenario? For the facts and circumstances that you've seen here,\n       what is justice?\n\n\n               \"The State of Kansas, the death penalty. If not this case, what case?\"\n\n\n       Our law is clear: In the context of witness credibility, a prosecutor expressing an\nopinion is a form of unsworn, unchecked testimony rather than commentary on the\nevidence. State v. Pabst, 268 Kan. 501, 510, 996 P.2d 321 (2000). This tracks Rule 3.4(e)\nof the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct: \"A lawyer shall not . . . state a personal\nopinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil\n\n\n\n                                                    54\n\flitigant or the guilt or innocence of an accused.\" KRPC 3.4(e) (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at\n394).\n\n\n        Flack mischaracterizes the nature and intent of the prosecutor's words. First, while\nthe prosecutor mentioned his experience as a \"seasoned prosecutor,\" he did so during voir\ndire and penalty-phase closing. During voir dire, the prosecutor asked one of the panels if\nanyone was nervous. When three of the six raised their hands, he said, \"[A]s you can tell\nby the color of my hair, I'm a seasoned prosecutor and I've handled capital murder death\npenalty cases before, also homicide cases, but I still get nervous.\" This statement's\npurpose was simply to relax nervous jurors.\n\n\n        Second, the prosecutor used the phrase \"seasoned prosecutor\" during the penalty-\nphase closing colloquially to remark on his age, not to tell jurors to trust his judgment\nover their own. After discussing the weighing process instruction, he said, \"So you know,\nat this point as a prosecutor and as you can see I'm a seasoned prosecutor, been around\nawhile. I usually . . . zoom back in to the key place.\" Here, the \"key place\" was the master\nbedroom where the bodies were found. But the prosecutor really wanted \"to zoom in on\nthe courtroom,\" calling for the jurors to consider the presented facts and law.\n\n\n        Neither statement related to his separate query, \"If not this case, what case?\"\nduring penalty-phase closing. The logical leap is too large to conclude combining these\nunrelated statements told the jury the prosecutor had seen a lot of cases and felt this one\nwas deathworthy. His comments were made far apart and separately. Their combined\neffect was not error.\n\n\n        That said, it is possible the \"if not this case\" comment alone is error. As Flack\npoints out, at least two other jurisdictions have held similar comments to be error. The\n\n\n                                              55\n\fOklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals disapproved of a problematic prosecutor who had\nrun afoul of the court:\n\n\n       \"[T]he prosecutor improperly pleaded with the jury to do justice 'and the only way you\n       can do that is bring back a sentence of death.' He also told the jury 'If this isn't a death\n       penalty case, what is?' It is error for a prosecutor . . . state his personal opinion as to the\n       appropriateness of the death penalty.\" (Emphasis added.) Torres v. State, 962 P.2d 3, 18\n       (Okla. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n\n       Although Torres does not give more context for the nearly identical statement, the\ncourt ultimately ruled the statement along with the prosecutor's other errors were\nharmless. 962 P.2d at 18.\n\n\n       Flack's second case, stemming from a Missouri habeas corpus petition, required\nvacating the defendant's death sentence. There, the prosecutor spoke his opinion:\n\n\n       \"I've been a prosecutor for ten years and I've never asked a jury for a death penalty, but I\n       can tell you in all candor, I've never seen a man who deserved it more than [the\n       defendant]. By returning your verdict in this case . . . that either means that you believe\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that he pulled the trigger, or that he had the frame of mind\n       that's consistent with pulling the trigger, and I submit to you, that [the defendant] did pull\n       the trigger, and didn't pull it once, but pulled it twice\u2014executed an innocent man in cold\n       blood.\n\n\n                \"So, where do we go from there? I say to you that I never saw a man who\n       deserved it more and I say that to you in complete sincerity, and it's my job, as I see it, to\n       tell you that.\" Newlon v. Armontrout, 693 F. Supp. 799, 804 (W.D. Mo. 1988), aff'd 885\n       F.2d 1328 (8th Cir. 1989).\n\n\n\n\n                                                      56\n\f       The Newlon court held the prosecutor discussing declining to seek the death\npenalty until this case was improper, especially when the death penalty statutes were\nunconstitutional for much of that period. Newlon, 693 F. Supp. at 804-05. The Newlon\nprosecutor continued that theme but added several more erroneous statements. He\nemphasized he was the \"'top law enforcement officer of the [c]ounty,'\" compared the\ndefendant to infamous mass-murderers, personalized analogies to jurors defending their\nown children, referenced war and courage, insinuated all murder should be punished with\ndeath, and reassured jurors appellate review follows any death sentence. 693 F. Supp. at\n808. In combination, the jury faced a \"relentless, focused, uncorrected argument based on\nfear, premised on facts not in evidence, and calculated to remove reason and\nresponsibility from the sentencing process.\" 693 F. Supp. at 808.\n\n\n       By contrast, the prosecutorial remark here, taken in context, permissibly and\nsimply requested jurors to accurately perform their jobs by following their instructions.\nThe prosecutor did not commit error.\n\n\n            HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS, OR CRUEL AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n\n       The State charged Flack with capital murder based on the \"intentional and\npremeditated killing of more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in\ntwo or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct.\" K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-5401(a)(6). The instruction for\ncapital murder required the jury to find Flack \"purposefully killed [K.B.] and L.B.\" The\nState's notice of intent to seek the death penalty included the aggravator: \"The defendant,\nas to [K.B.], committed the crime in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner\"\nfollowing K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-6624(f)'s exact language. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\f       Flack argues the heinous manner aggravator is limited to \"the crime,\" while the\nversion of capital murder he was convicted of required multiple killings, so the State had\nto allege and prove he killed both K.B. and L.B. in a heinous manner. We disagree. The\nstatutory scheme does not require this.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       To the extent this issue requires statutory interpretation, it presents a question of\nlaw subject to unlimited review. If the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, we\napply the language as written. State v. Dinkel, 314 Kan. 146, 155, 495 P.3d 402 (2021).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       Flack equates the State's notice of intent to seek the death penalty with a charging\ndocument. He cites State v. Dunn, 304 Kan. 773, 375 P.3d 332 (2016), to support his\nclaim the State needed to \"charge\" the heinous aggravator as to both K.B. and L.B. In\nDunn, we identified \"three possible types of charging document insufficiency a criminal\ndefendant may challenge.\" 304 Kan. at 815. First, a charging document must meet \"the\nKansas constitutional minimums of correct court and correct territory.\" 304 Kan. at\n815. Second, it must allege \"facts about the intent and action on the part of the defendant\nthat, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, would constitute violation of a Kansas\ncriminal statute.\" 304 Kan. at 815. Third, it must satisfy \"federal and state constitutional\nstandards for due process and notice, such that the defendant has an opportunity to meet\nand answer the State's evidence and prevent double jeopardy.\" 304 Kan. at 815. The type\nof deficiency determines the available remedies for each. 304 Kan. at 816-17.\n\n\n       Flack argues his claim falls within the second and third categories: The State\n\"failed to state facts that constitute a Kansas crime\" and \"the defective charge denied\n                                               58\n\f[him] due process.\" Before discussing Dunn, and what it means here, we note the process\nfor pursuing the death penalty differs from charging the underlying crime of capital\nmurder. That distinction is critical to understanding Dunn's limitations.\n\n\n       In setting the second category's framework\u2014charging the underlying crime of\ncapital murder\u2014the Dunn court noted K.S.A. 22-3201(b) requires a charging document\nto \"state 'essential facts' constituting the crime charged.\" 304 Kan. at 811. The statute\nemphasizes \"'facts' rather than 'elements.'\" 304 Kan. at 811. \"A Kansas charging\ndocument should be regarded as sufficient . . . when it has alleged facts that would\nestablish the defendant's commission of a crime recognized in Kansas.\" 304 Kan. at 811-\n12.\n\n\n       To determine whether the alleged facts constitute a Kansas crime, we use the\ncrime's statutory definition to determine if the factual allegations, if proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, would justify a guilty verdict. 304 Kan. at 812. The State charged Flack\nunder K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-5401(a)(6) with the \"intentional and premeditated killing of\nmore than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in two or more acts or\ntransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" The capital murder's definition does not include aggravating circumstances.\nThose are instead set forth in the death sentence procedure statutes, applicable only after\nthe State obtains a conviction for capital murder.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(a) governs the State's requirements to give a written\nnotice of its intent to seek the death penalty. If the prosecutor fails to give the notice and\nthe defendant is convicted of capital murder, the sentence will be life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole, and death penalty cannot be imposed. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 21-6617(a).\n\n\n                                              59\n\f       But the notice of intent is not the State's only obligation. The State must also\nprovide the defendant notice of all aggravating factor evidence it plans to use. See K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-6617(c). Notably, the subsection (c) notice does not need to be provided at\nthe same time as the subsection (a) notice. Kleypas I, 272 Kan. at 979. The Kleypas I\ncourt distinguished between the two notice requirements. The notice of intent allows the\ndefendant to begin their preparation for trial as it serves notice that the case will indeed\nbe a death penalty case, thus allowing them to make choices regarding the retention of\ncounsel, plea bargaining, and preparation of mitigating factors. 272 Kan. at 979-80. On\nthe other hand, the subsection (c) notice permits, but does not require, the State to give\nnotice of aggravating circumstances. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(c) (\"Only such\nevidence of aggravating circumstances as the state has made known to the defendant\nprior to the sentencing proceeding shall be admissible.\"). The State need only give such\nnotice \"within a reasonable time prior to trial to allow the defendant an opportunity to\nprepare to defend against the aggravating circumstances.\" Kleypas I, 272 Kan. at 980.\n\n\n       Flack's claim the State must prove he killed both K.B. and L.B. in a heinous\nmanner does not neatly fit the charging deficiency paradigm under Dunn; it more closely\nresembles an evidence sufficiency claim. The State met both statutory notice\nrequirements about its intent to seek the death penalty and its intended aggravating factor\nevidence. Neither statutes nor caselaw supports such a claim.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624 sets out the aggravating circumstances available for\ncapital murder:\n\n\n              \"(a) The defendant was previously convicted of a felony in which the defendant\n       inflicted great bodily harm, disfigurement, dismemberment or death on another.\n\n\n              \"(b) The defendant knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death\n       to more than one person.\n                                                 60\n\f        \"(c) The defendant committed the crime for the defendant's self or another for the\npurpose of receiving money or any other thing of monetary value.\n\n\n        \"(d) The defendant authorized or employed another person to commit the crime.\n\n\n        \"(e) The defendant committed the crime in order to avoid or prevent a lawful\narrest or prosecution.\n\n\n        \"(f) The defendant committed the crime in an especially heinous, atrocious or\ncruel manner. A finding that the victim was aware of such victim's fate or had conscious\npain and suffering as a result of the physical trauma that resulted in the victim's death is\nnot necessary to find that the manner in which the defendant killed the victim was\nespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel. Conduct which is heinous, atrocious or cruel may\ninclude, but is not limited to:\n\n\n        (1) Prior stalking of or criminal threats to the victim;\n\n\n        (2) preparation or planning, indicating an intention that the killing was meant to\n        be especially heinous, atrocious or cruel;\n\n\n        (3) infliction of mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death;\n\n\n        (4) torture of the victim;\n\n\n        (5) continuous acts of violence begun before or continuing after the killing;\n\n\n        (6) desecration of the victim's body in a manner indicating a particular depravity\n        of mind, either during or following the killing; or\n\n\n        (7) any other conduct the trier of fact expressly finds is especially heinous.\n\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f               \"(g) The defendant committed the crime while serving a sentence of\n       imprisonment on conviction of a felony.\n\n\n               \"(h) The victim was killed while engaging in, or because of the victim's\n       performance or prospective performance of, the victim's duties as a witness in a criminal\n       proceeding.\"\n\n\n       Flack correctly states the heinous manner aggravator applies to \"the crime,\" not\nthe crime's elements, but his conclusion that each killing in a multiple-killing capital\nmurder must have been committed heinously does not necessarily follow.\n\n\n       As readily seen, the aggravating circumstances apply to various subjects\u2014such as\n\"the defendant,\" \"the crime,\" and \"the victim\"\u2014between subsections. Subsection (f)\ndefines the heinous manner aggravator with both \"the crime\" and \"the victim.\" It provides\na nonexhaustive list of circumstances a jury may find heinous including conduct\nconcurrent with the act of killing or conduct not necessarily concurrent with a killing,\nsuch as prior stalking and planning or preparation. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(1)-(2).\nFinally, subsection (f) encompasses a catchall provision of \"any other conduct\" the jury\n\"expressly finds is especially heinous.\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(7).\n\n\n       So, rather than requiring the heinous manner aggravator apply to each killing, the\nstatute instead focuses on whether \"the crime\" in total was committed in a heinous\nmanner. Nothing in the statute supports Flack's reading. Under our death penalty scheme,\nany finding of an aggravating circumstance, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances,\nis sufficient to sentence the defendant to death. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e). The\nscheme does not assign weight to the number of aggravating circumstances; the finding\nof such a circumstance merely triggers the weighing process.\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\f       The State alleged the heinous manner circumstance and gave Flack notice about its\nintended evidence to prove the circumstance specifically related to Flack killing K.B.\nImposing a death sentence here did not deprive Flack of due process.\n\n\n    JURY INSTRUCTIONS: SENTENCING PROCEEDING AND DUTY-TO-REACH-VERDICT\n\n\n       Flack challenges two jury instructions from the penalty phase. He argues the first\npenalty-phase instruction that informed jurors a guilty verdict would be followed by a\nseparate sentencing proceeding erroneously implied the jury would not be responsible for\nsentencing. He also contests the verdict form alleging it told jurors they had to reach a\nunanimous decision to give him a life sentence.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review jury instructions under a three-step framework. First, we determine if\nthe issue was properly preserved below. Second, we consider the claim's merits to decide\nwhether error occurred below. At this step, we consider if the challenged instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate. We exercise unlimited review of the entire record and\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the requesting party. Finally, if there was\nerror, we examine if the error was harmless. State v. Gleason, 305 Kan. 794, 800-01, 388\nP.3d 101 (2017); Kleypas II, 305 Kan. at 305-06.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       The first instruction told the jury that \"when a defendant has been found guilty of\ncapital murder, a separate sentencing proceeding shall be conducted to determine whether\nthe defendant shall be sentenced to death.\" (Emphasis added.) At trial, Flack requested to\n\n\n                                             63\n\freplace \"shall\" with \"may\" because it implies \"the jury was not ultimately responsible\nfor\" sentencing. The court declined, and before us Flack raises the argument again.\n\n\n       There may be a grain of truth to Flack's claim in that a penalty phase is not needed\nif the State does not seek the death penalty. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(a) (requiring\nthe State give written notice within seven days of arraignment it intends to seek the death\npenalty). Otherwise, a person convicted of capital murder receives a life sentence. But his\ndesired language misstates the law because a person can only be sentenced to death if a\njury makes the necessary findings. Changing \"shall\" to \"may\" could lead the jury to\nbelieve the State had another procedural option to obtain a death sentence, and \"the\nuncorrected suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will\nrest with others presents an intolerable danger.\" Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320,\n333, 105 S. Ct. 2633, 86 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1985).\n\n\n       Whether a separate sentencing proceeding happens in every capital case or only\nafter the State decides to pursue that option, the given instruction here fairly stated the\nlaw and did not mislead the jury.\n\n\n       Next, at the penalty phase's conclusion, the court instructed the jury on completing\nthe verdict form, explaining, \"[I]f one or more jurors are not persuaded beyond a\nreasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating\ncircumstances, then you shall sign the appropriate alternative verdict form indicating the\njury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict sentencing the defendant to death.\"\n(Emphasis added.) The verdict form provided two options: (1) the standard and\nnecessary findings to impose a death sentence with space to note applicable aggravating\nfactors, and (2) \"We, the jury . . . state that we are unable to reach a unanimous verdict\nsentencing the defendant to death.\" (Emphasis added.) Over Flack's objection the \"unable\n\n\n                                              64\n\fto\" language implied jurors must reach a unanimous verdict for or against the death\nsentence, the court declined to replace \"unable\" with \"did not.\"\n\n\n        His suggested language advances a novel reading of the death penalty sentencing\nstatutes. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e) provides:\n\n\n                \"If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or\n        more of the aggravating circumstances . . . exist and, further, that the existence of such\n        aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are\n        found to exist, the defendant shall be sentenced to death; otherwise, the defendant shall\n        be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The jury, if its verdict is a\n        unanimous recommendation of a sentence of death, shall designate in writing, signed by\n        the foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstances which it found beyond a\n        reasonable doubt. If, after a reasonable time for deliberation, the jury is unable to reach\n        a verdict, the judge shall dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of life without the\n        possibility of parole.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n        According to Flack, the third sentence conflicts with the first. He argues,\n\"Sentence one says that the inability to agree is a life verdict; sentence three seems to say\nthe inability to agree is not a verdict at all.\" But even if Flack's suggested conflict exists,\nhis preferred interpretation does not materially differ from the Kleypas I court's\nunderstanding of the statute. In Kleypas I, the court held a sentencing verdict form\nstating, \"'We, the jury . . . unanimously determine that a sentence as provided by law be\nimposed by the Court,'\" misled the jury it must reach a unanimous verdict. Kleypas I, 272\nKan. at 1062. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617's predecessor \"does not require the jury to\nunanimously conclude that a death sentence is unwarranted in order to sentence the\ndefendant to a punishment other than death; rather, the jury must only fail to unanimously\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a death sentence is warranted.\" 272 Kan. at\n1062.\n\n                                                      65\n\f       Flack correctly notes the jury is not under a duty to reach a unanimous verdict, but\nhe fails to establish the given instruction might lead jurors to believe such a duty existed.\nThe instruction and verdict form accurately state the law and could not have misled the\njury. See State v. Sims, 308 Kan. 1488, 1505, 431 P.3d 288 (2018) (jury instructions\nreviewed \"together as a whole,\" not in isolation). The instruction informed the jury the\nsentence would be life without parole if it could not reach a verdict, and the verdict form\nprovided an option to state it could not reach a unanimous verdict of death. Nothing\nimplied it must reach a unanimous decision to impose a life sentence.\n\n\n                            EIGHTH AMENDMENT CHALLENGE\n\n\n       Flack raises a categorical Eighth Amendment challenge to his death sentence, even\nthough he acknowledges we recently addressed and rejected nearly identical claims in\nKleypas II, 305 Kan. at 328, 337, and State v. Kahler, 307 Kan. 374, 406, 409, 410 P.3d\n105 (2018). In both cases, counsel compared the mentally ill to intellectually disabled\npeople to establish they are less culpable for their crimes. Flack reiterates those\narguments without adding anything materially different from prior cases, so Kleypas II\ncontrols. We see no reason to revisit its holding.\n\n\n            SECTIONS 1 AND 5 OF THE KANSAS CONSTITUTION BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n\n       Flack challenges the death penalty's constitutionality under section 1 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. We addressed the same issue in State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 615,\n625-26, 502 P.3d 546 (2022) (R. Carr II), and State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 744, 753, 502 P.3d\n511 (2022). In those cases, we characterized the argument as contending \"section 1\nprotects the right to life, and Kansas' capital sentencing scheme unconstitutionally\n\n\n                                             66\n\finfringes upon this right.\" R. Carr II, 314 Kan. at 627. We rejected that argument,\nholding:\n\n\n               \"The historical record reflects the framers did not intend the term 'inalienable' in\n       section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights to be construed as 'absolute' and\n       'nonforfeitable.' Instead, a careful reading of section 1, coupled with the transcripts of the\n       convention debate, demonstrates that the term 'inalienable' refers only to one's ability to\n       transfer his or her right or interest to another person. Though inalienable, the framers\n       viewed the natural rights guaranteed within this section to be forfeitable in civil society.\n       So construed, the framers did not intend for section 1 to impede or limit the State's\n       authority to punish individuals for their criminal conduct.\" 314 Kan. 615, Syl. \u00b6 4.\n\n\n       Additionally, Flack attacked the death penalty under section 5 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. R. Carr II also addressed that issue, as a \"constitutional\nchallenge to the practice of 'death qualifying' juries in Kansas\u2014the process of removing\nprospective jurors for cause . . . when their conscientious objection to capital punishment\nsubstantially impairs their ability to fulfill the oath and obligations of a juror.\" 314 Kan.\nat 645. We rejected that argument, holding:\n\n\n       \"[B]oth the plain meaning and historical record confirm that a 'jury' is defined as a group\n       comprised of persons who will determine issues of fact and return a decision based on the\n       evidence and in accordance with the law as instructed. Death qualification . . . removes\n       only those prospective jurors who cannot fulfill these obligations due to conscientious\n       objection to the death penalty, i.e., the statute authorizes removal of those prospective\n       jurors excluded from the constitutional definition of a 'jury.' Thus, death qualification\n       facilitates the very jury trial right guaranteed by section 5. Moreover, when the Kansas\n       Constitution was adopted in 1859, the common law did not preclude, and in fact\n       authorized, this procedure. For these reasons, we hold that death qualification under\n       K.S.A. 22-3410 does not violate section 5.\" 314 Kan. at 653.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    67\n\f       Flack offers no new authority or argument warranting revisiting of R. Carr II.\n\n\n                                    CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n\n       Based on our rulings, the cumulative error doctrine has no application. State v.\nSieg, 315 Kan. 526, 536, 509 P.3d 535 (2022).\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm Flack's convictions and sentence. No errors warrant reversal of his\nconvictions or sentence. We conclude \"the evidence supports the findings that\" one or\nmore aggravating circumstances \"existed and that any mitigating circumstances were\ninsufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\" See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-\n6619(c)(2). We also conclude the jury imposed the death sentence without \"the influence\nof passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\" See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(c)(1).\n\n\n                                             ***\n\n\n       STEGALL, J., concurring: I concur with the majority's decision to affirm Flack's\nconvictions and sentence. I depart, however, from the majority's application of section 1\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights in the death penalty context. In my view, our\ncourt continues to be wrong by declaring that criminal defendants have no protections\nunder section 1. See State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 744, 782-83, 502 P.3d 511 (2022) (Stegall,\nJ., concurring) (\"[T]he majority makes it explicit that a criminal defendant has no section\n1 protections at all. Indeed, according to the majority, 'the state's power to punish' is\nlimited only by 'due process' and 'cruel or unusual' provisions which 'do not arise under\nsection 1.'\"), cert. denied 143 S.

To effectuate that check on state police power, I\narticulated the judicial test\u2014rooted in our history and precedent\u2014courts should apply to\nany section 1 challenge. 309 Kan. at 767 (Stegall, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       But here, as in Carr, \"[t]he lower courts have not inquired into the [police power\ntest], the parties have not briefed the issue, and this court has declined to take it up.\"\nCarr, 314 Kan. at 783 (Stegall, J., concurring). It is true that Flack has at least gestured\ntoward applying the appropriate section 1 police power test I set forth in Hodes. But he\nhas not made any substantive argument beyond a few conclusory statements, and the\nrecord below is entirely void of any findings that might support his claim. In a future\ncase, I am open to considering the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty under\nsection 1's limit on state police powers. But doing so would require an actual showing\nbased on something more substantial than Flack has provided to demonstrate that our\ndeath penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance of the common good.\n\n\n       So as before, given \"the monumental consequences of the state's exercise of this\nmost final, most irreversible, and most grave use of power\u2014killing a human person\u2014I\nam left with a profound and unshakable disquiet about our court's blessing upon these\nprocedures.\" 314 Kan. at 783 (Stegall, J., concurring). And because I cannot \"presume\nour death penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance or protection of the common\ngood\u2014or that it is otherwise arbitrary, irrational, or discriminatory . . . I am left with no\noption other than to concur in the judgment.\" 314 Kan. at 784 (Stegall, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                              69\n\f                                             ***\n\n\n       WILSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: The majority finds\nambiguity in Kyle Flack's many attempts to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence\nduring his interview with police in the early morning hours of May 8, 2013. I cannot\nagree. Taken collectively, I would hold Flack's final four statements constitute an\nunequivocal invocation of his right to silence\u2014an invocation which his interrogators\nfailed to scrupulously honor. Because I view the admission of Flack's post-invocation\nstatements to be prejudicial to his convictions for the murders of Andrew Stout and\nSteven White, I would reverse those convictions and remand for a new trial. And while I\nbelieve the evidence of Flack's guilt for his capital murder charge was robust enough to\nprevent reversal of that conviction, I cannot conclude that the admission of Flack's\nstatements was harmless as to his sentence of death. Thus, for the reasons below, I\nrespectfully concur in part in the result and dissent in part.\n\n\n       Our test here is ostensibly an objective one: \"whether a reasonable police officer\nunder the circumstances would understand the suspect's statement as an assertion of a\nMiranda right.\" State v. Aguirre, 301 Kan. 950, 957, 349 P.3d 1245 (2015). As the\nmajority notes, despite Flack's failure to frame this issue under the right to silence at trial,\nwe can still consider it under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(b). Slip op. at 14-15. Further,\neven without testimony on the specifics of Flack's statements, the record before us\ncontains the best evidence available in the form of the interview video. We know the time\nand place of this interview; we can assess for ourselves Flack's tone and manner, as well\nas the detectives' varied responses to his at-issue statements.\n\n\n       More importantly, the facts before us also reveal that the investigators' key\nconcern in the interview was \"finding [L.B.],\" who was still missing then and might\u2014for\n                                           70\n\fall they knew then\u2014still have been alive. This concern can be readily divined from\ninterviewers' questions themselves: the first thing Alexander asked Flack was \"if he\nknew where [L.B.] was located.\"\n\n\n       I mention this not because the officers' subjective understanding of Flack's\nstatements matters to our analysis\u2014it does not\u2014but to provide context for their\nresponses to those statements. To put a finer point on it, their uncertainty over L.B.'s fate\nquashed all incentive for the detectives to treat any statement as an invocation of the right\nto silence. In other words, the detectives effectively wore blinders of incomprehension\nwhen presented with Flack's repeated statements because they wanted to prolong the\ninterview; they wanted Flack's statements to be ambiguous.\n\n\n       This is why the detectives' subjective understanding of Flack's invocations is, and\nmust be, irrelevant to whether Flack invoked his right to silence. Anyone can appreciate\nthe detectives' concern for finding L.B. For all they knew at the beginning of the\ninterview, she might still have been alive, and Flack might have been the key to bringing\nher to safety. But as an appellate court, we must concentrate on the statements Flack\nmade and on whether a reasonable officer would understand that Flack was exercising his\nconstitutional right to stop the inquiry by invoking his right to remain silent. The officers'\nunderstandable concern for L.B. does not lessen their responsibility to Flack. But this\nconcern necessarily colors the detectives' responses to Flack's statements, including the\nalleged invocations here. Thus, we must consider what Flack said\u2014and the\ncircumstances in which he said it\u2014to conclude whether a reasonable officer would have\nunderstood him to be invoking his right to silence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\f       Flack's final four statements, collectively, were clear and unequivocal.\n\n\n       Flack points to several statements as attempted invocations of his right to silence. I\nagree with the majority that most of Flack's earlier statements were ambiguous for the\nreasons discussed in the majority opinion. Slip op. at 16-19. But I cannot agree that\nFlack's final four \"take me to jail\" statements\u2014the ones the majority labels as Flack's\nseventh through tenth\u2014were ambiguous. Slip op. at 19-22. Among other possible\ninterpretations, the majority suggests that, \"In context, these comments show Flack\nbelieved the questioning about what happened at Stout's house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right.\" Slip op. at 22. It further reads Flack's statements as\nshowing that Flack \"simply claimed the detectives had already made up their minds about\nhis involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help them find the\nchild\"\u2014and, thus, Flack was not invoking his right to silence. Slip op. at 22.\n\n\n       But while the cold words of the transcript may lend credence to the majority's\nposition that Flack might have meant any number of things, the way Flack said them\u2014\nalong with their repetition\u2014clarifies any ambiguity, in my view. And although an\nappellate opinion cannot entirely convey the nuanced audiovisual information presented\nin the videos of Flack's interrogation, that information is at least as important in\nestablishing the context and meaning of Flack's words as the words themselves. To\nclarify the basis for my dissent, then, a bit of additional description is needed.\n\n\n       As the majority notes, Flack made his final four \"take me to jail\" comments during\na portion of questioning about the identities of his violent, drug-related contacts in\nEmporia. Slip op. at 19-22. At first, as the detective began to explore Flack's involvement\nwith these contacts, Flack abruptly said, \"Take me to jail,\" and looked down at his lap.\nThe detective asked a question. Flack did not respond, but only said, \"Take me to jail.\"\nThe detective asked another question. Flack again only said, \"Take me to jail.\" This time,\n                                           72\n\fthere was silence for several seconds. At this point, I believe Flack's intent to invoke his\nright to remain silent became clear. Even so, the detectives again asked more questions.\nAfter answering a couple of them, Flack again said, \"Take me to jail.\" This time he\ncrossed his arms and put his head down on the table. He clearly wanted to stop the\ninterview.\n\n\n       The worst of Flack's self-incriminating statements followed.\n\n\n       These last four statements of, \"Take me to jail,\" lacked some of the accompanying\nphrases held elsewhere to render similar statements ambiguous, and their exact repetition\nin the face of several different questions underscored what was, in my view, a clear intent\nto cut off the interview. Cf. People v. Jackson, 1 Cal. 5th 269, 336-41, 205 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n386, 376 P.3d 528 (2016) (\"Man just take me to jail man. I don't wanna talk no more,\"\nwas clear and unambiguous.); State v. Jang, 359 N.J. Super. 85, 90, 819 A.2d 9 (App.\nDiv. 2003) (Defendant's statement, \"'I don't want to talk anymore. Take me to jail,'\"\nterminated the interview.). Any alternative interpretations of these statements strains\ncredulity, in my view: if Flack meant anything besides \"take me to jail,\" he would have\nsaid as much during one of his repetitions of the phrase. That he did not crystalizes the\nclear and unambiguous meaning of his words and their necessary implication: terminate\nthe interview by taking him to jail. Unlike the majority, I thus believe Flack's statements\ncollectively made his meaning clear. I cannot support the majority's speculation as to\nFlack's meaning, that is, that he was merely expressing his belief about the irrelevance of\nthe detectives' line of questioning.\n\n\n       The State claims that Flack's earlier, ambiguous responses taint the meaning of his\nlater ones. But we have soundly rejected such arguments in the past, and I would do so\nagain here. Cf. State v. Walker, 304 Kan. 441, 456, 372 P.3d 1147 (2016) (earlier\nambiguous statements did not undermine the clarity of a later set of statements that\n                                         73\n\f\"[c]ollectively . . . would have made it clear to reasonable law enforcement officers\" that\na suspect was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to silence). As I have written, Flack's\nwords\u2014and, perhaps more critically, how he said them\u2014rendered his meaning perfectly\nclear to a reasonable officer.\n\n\n       The majority also finds ambiguity in two of Flack's responses\u2014\"What do you\nwant me to tell you?\" and, \"I don't know the fuckin' people\"\u2014which, the majority,\nclaims, \"lead to a reasonable inference Flack meant 'I don't know,' rather than invoking\nhis right to remain silent.\" Slip op. at 21-22. But the majority's reliance on these\nstatements is flawed. Flack made the first statement between his ninth and tenth\nattempted invocations, and he made the second one after his tenth and final attempted\ninvocation. Slip op. at 21-22. In my view, Flack had already made his meaning clear, at\nthe very latest, by his ninth overall statement: the penultimate \"take me to jail\" comment.\nStatements made after an invocation cannot be used to retroactively \"cast doubt on the\nadequacy\" of that invocation, as the majority attempts to do now. E.g., Smith v. Illinois,\n469 U.S. 91, 98-99, 105 S. Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1984). \"In other words, if the\ninterrogators simply ignore the suspect's invocation of rights and continue to ask\nquestions, the suspect's compliance with the further questioning does not invalidate or\nrender equivocal the prior invocation of rights.\" Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 958. Thus, I am\ntroubled by the majority's efforts to retroactively interpret Flack's \"take me to jail\"\nstatements by relying on his later responses.\n\n\n       In evaluating the clarity of an alleged invocation of the right to silence, words\nmatter. Context matters. Magic words are not required. Emspak v. United States, 349 U.S.\n190, 194, 75 S. Ct. 687, 99 L. Ed. 997 (1955). When we speak of what a \"reasonable\nofficer\" would have understood, we are referring to an individual of ordinary intelligence\npossessed of ordinary linguistic comprehension skills. We are not speaking of individuals\nwho, for one reason or another, can apply the principles of arcane philosophies and\n                                            74\n\flexical sophistry to divine ambiguity where, in any ordinary conversation, there would be\nnone. A reasonable officer is not one motivated to find ambiguity no matter where or how\nhis goal finds quarter. This latter category naturally includes professional investigators\nwho may be motivated to remain, and thus do remain in the face of all evidence to the\ncontrary, doggedly \"uncertain\" about a suspect's meaning\u2014particularly those guided by\nthe best of intentions, such as the urgent need to locate a missing child and bring her\nsafely home. See, e.g., Sadeghi, Hung Up on Semantics: A Critique of Davis v. United\nStates, 23 Hastings Const. L.Q. 313, 336 (1995) (\"Perhaps the most troubling aspect of\nthe threshold-of-clarity approach is that it leaves the fox guarding the henhouse. The\npolice have little incentive to find that a statement was a clear invocation of rights.\").\n\n\n       Yet law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and courts alike have shown over and\nover their own mastery of speculative mental gymnastics where a suspect may be\ninvoking the right to silence or the right to counsel, but not \"clearly so.\" See generally 2\nLaFave, Israel, King & Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(g), n.184-85 (4th ed.) (cataloging\nmany cases finding ambiguity in \"even a statement which itself appears to amount to an\nassertion of the right to remain silent\"\u2014including the outright refusal to speak). Nor do\ncourts consider silence itself\u2014which a layperson might reasonably view as perhaps the\npurest indication that a suspect is invoking the right to silence\u2014to be a clear and\nunambiguous invocation of the right to silence. E.g., Evans v. Demosthenes, 902 F. Supp.\n1253, 1259-60 (D. Nev. 1995), aff'd 98 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 1996). Some of these\nexercises in linguistic contortionism pass beyond the point of parody. See, e.g., State v.\nDemesme, 228 So. 3d 1206, 1206-07 (La. 2017) (Crichton, J., concurring) (finding\nambiguity in the phrase \"'if y'all, this is how I feel, if y'all think I did it, I know that I\ndidn't do it so why don't you just give me a lawyer dog cause this is not what's up'\"\nbecause \"the defendant's ambiguous and equivocal reference to a 'lawyer dog' does not\nconstitute an invocation of counsel that warrants termination of the interview\").\n\n\n                                                75\n\f       Thus, despite the ostensibly objective, non-talismanic standard we purport to\napply, \"On the whole, courts have set a high threshold for explicit invocation, but it\nremains unclear what exactly a suspect must say or do to explicitly invoke silence.\"\nRushin, Rethinking Miranda: The Post-Arrest Right to Silence, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 151, 168\n(2011). One is forced to wonder, despite a plethora of caselaw to the contrary, whether\nmagic words are required, and even whether the magic words must be followed with\nactual silence before a suspect clearly and unambiguously invokes the right to silence\nunder the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Gee, Invoking the Right to Counsel and Right to\nRemain Silent: It's Just Not That Clear, 32 Miss. C. L. Rev. 69, 81-82 (2013) (\"As the\nerosion of Miranda continues with each subsequent Supreme Court term, the limitations\nplaced on both ambiguous requests for counsel under Davis and the right to silence under\nBerghuis seem destined to remain in place, or perhaps become even more narrow.\"). The\nvery meaning of the words \"clearly and unambiguously\" strains, cracks, and sometimes\nbreaks under the burden we place upon it. This case exemplifies this deterioration.\n\n\n       In other areas of police investigation, courts often give weight\u2014if not total\ndeference\u2014to an officer's deductions, instincts, training, and experience. See, e.g., State\nv. Cash, 313 Kan. 121, 133, 483 P.3d 1047 (2021) (\"deference\" given to officer's\ntestimony that \"in her training and experience a Crown Royal bag 'more often than not'\ncontains drug paraphernalia\" for purposes of reasonable suspicion); State v. Jones, 300\nKan. 630, 647-48, 333 P.3d 886 (2014) (recognizing \"some deference\" to an officer's\ntraining and experience in assessing reasonable suspicion based on suspicious driving,\nbut still agreeing \"with the district judge that the officer acted on a hunch, not reasonable\nsuspicion\"); State v. Moore, 283 Kan. 344, 359-60, 154 P.3d 1 (2007) (giving\n\"appropriate deference to the opinions of a particular law enforcement officer on the\nscene who, with thousands of traffic stops, is highly experienced in roadside searches and\nseizures and determinations of reasonable suspicion\" while cautioning against \"a total, or\nsubstantial, deference to law enforcement's opinion concerning the presence of\n                                            76\n\freasonable suspicion\"); State v. Wonders, 263 Kan. 582, 598, 600, 952 P.2d 1351 (1998)\n(trial court considered officer's training and experience in finding probable cause to\nbelieve a bulge in a suspect's pocket was marijuana, but recognizing \"that experienced,\nknowledgeable law enforcement officers know the 'magic words' to be related when their\nsearches and seizures are challenged\"). Yet in the arena of the Fifth Amendment, courts\nconstructively infantilize officers by imputing to them a basic lack of language\ncomprehension. Moreover, our legal framework provides little incentive for officers to\nexercise caution in the face of a possible invocation\u2014anything besides a precise\nrecitation of some court-approved legal formula. After all, if a court can divine any\nambiguity at all in a suspect's statements, it will reward an officer's constructive\n\"uncertainty\" over any language that does not contain a precise invocation incantation. In\nother words, we have created a system under which officers have little reason not to\ngamble by refusing to scrupulously honor an invocation\u2014unless, that is, it is expressed\nthrough a set of specific legal magic words.\n\n\n       Here, a reasonable detective could not have understood Flack's repeated identical\n\"take me to jail\" statements to mean anything besides a request to terminate the interview\nand \"take [him] to jail.\" The majority's alternative view\u2014that Flack's responses could be\ninterpreted as merely bemoaning the futility of the detectives' line of questioning\u2014\nappears strained to me. \"We should not seek ambiguity where none exists\" to sanction\ndetectives' continued questioning in the face of an invocation of the right to silence. Cf.\nU. S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. W. Cas. & Sur. Co., 195 Kan. 603, 605, 408 P.2d 596 (1965)\n(refusing to invoke the rule of liberal construction when an insurance policy used\nunambiguous language). Flack repeated his precise request to be taken to jail over and\nover; I cannot view such exact repetition as anything other than an attempt to terminate\nthe conversation.\n\n\n\n                                               77\n\f       Thus, in my view, Flack did what he needed to do to invoke his right to silence\nunder the Fifth Amendment. An invocation need not be perfect\u2014and Flack's was not\u2014\nbut Flack's meaning should have been clear to his interviewers all the same. The\ndetectives failed to scrupulously honor that invocation, and thus the district court erred in\nfailing to suppress his statements.\n\n\n       This failure also extends to the statements Flack made during the second\ninterview, which the prosecution used to develop its theory of the case. As we have said,\n\n\n               \"Based on Miranda and [Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L.\n       Ed. 2d 313 (1975)], if a defendant invokes his or her right to remain silent, the\n       interrogation must stop immediately and the right must be scrupulously honored. This\n       does not mean an interrogation resumed at a later time is invalidated if the defendant\n       knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to be silent at this later time and the\n       defendant's right to be silent was scrupulously honored while it was invoked.\" State v.\n       Robinson, 261 Kan. 865, 887-88, 934 P.2d 38 (1997).\n\n\n       In Aguirre, the court considered \"whether the police could obtain a valid Miranda\nrights waiver at a subsequent interrogation after refusing to honor an invocation of those\nrights at the first interview.\" 301 Kan. at 961. The Aguirre majority found that the\ndefendant attempted to invoke his Miranda rights and cease questioning in an initial\ninterview, but that detectives failed to scrupulously honor that invocation. This, the\nmajority concluded, meant that Aguirre's statements in the first interview should have\nbeen suppressed. In considering Aguirre's statements at a followup interview, the\nmajority applied a two-part analysis previously set forth in State v. Matson, 260 Kan.\n366, 374, 921 P.2d 790 (1996), and State v. Mattox, 280 Kan. 473, 481, 124 P.3d 6\n(2005):\n\n\n\n\n                                                    78\n\f       \"[T]he validity of a Miranda waiver, after a suspect has previously invoked those rights,\n       depends on whether 'the accused (a) initiated further discussions with the police and (b)\n       knowingly and intelligently waived the previously asserted right.' The State failed the\n       Matson test by reinitiating the second interrogation. [Citations omitted.]\" Aguirre, 301\n       Kan. at 961.\n\n\n       Thus, the court concluded, \"Under that circumstance, the police were constrained,\nif not prohibited, from reinitiating questioning\" and \"the statements obtained in the\nsecond interview should have been suppressed, as well.\" Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 961-62.\n\n\n       Here, detectives did not stop their questioning after Flack's invocation. Instead,\nthey continued to try to convince Flack to \"help us find this baby\" by zeroing in on the\n\"Mexicans\" or \"South Side \"South Side Lobos\" he had mentioned. And while the second\ninterview began about fourteen-and-a-half hours after the first interview ended\u2014an\ninterlude in which Flack was offered three meals and \"a place to rest\"\u2014and while Flack\nwas given fresh Miranda warnings at the outset of the second interview, detectives, not\nFlack, initiated the second interview. Thus, Flack's statements in the second interview\nshould have also been suppressed.\n\n\n       Harmlessness\u2014Guilt Phase\n\n\n       I turn next to the harmlessness of the district court's error.\n\n\n               \"When a defendant's constitutional rights have been violated, the State must\n       'carry the burden of proving \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of . . .\n       did not affect the outcome of the trial in light of the entire record, i.e., proves there is no\n       reasonable possibility that the error affected the verdict.\"'\" Walker, 304 Kan. at 457.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     79\n\f       I begin with the error's effect on the guilt phase of Flack's trial, beginning with his\nconviction for the killing of White.\n\n\n       White's Killing\n\n\n       During his second interview, Flack admitted that he and Stout killed White\ntogether, each of them shooting White once with a shotgun. Flack further admitted to\ncovering White's body with a tarp and leaving it in the outbuilding for more than a week.\nAs the prosecutor emphasized during closing arguments, evidence suggested that White\ndied from two gunshot wounds, each caused by PDX Home Defender shotgun rounds. In\nhis pre-\"invocation\" statements, Flack admitted purchasing Defender rounds for his\nshotgun.\n\n\n       The shotgun that was partially recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014\nwhich contained a mixed DNA profile from at least three people, of whom Flack could\nnot be excluded as the major contributor\u2014fired at least one of the shell casings found in\nthe outbuilding where White was killed. Evidence also suggested that this same weapon\nfired the five shell casings recovered from the residence's master bedroom, where the\nbodies of Stout and K.B. were found and where (based on bloodstains) evidence\nsuggested L.B. was shot. The weapon was a 12-gauge \"pump action\" shotgun that\nrequired a discrete action to eject a spent round and chamber a new round before each\nindividual shot could be fired. Evidence suggested that Flack owned a 12-gauge pump\naction shotgun that he kept at Stout's property, of which he was \"proud.\" One witness\nnoted that Flack \"had [the shotgun] with him everywhere he went\" and that he had even\nslept next to it at times. In his pre-\"invocation\" statements, Flack admitted that he owned\na \"Remington 1300.\"\n\n\n\n                                              80\n\f       In closing arguments, the prosecutor noted the lack of forensic evidence of a\nstruggle surrounding White's death and highlighted evidence suggesting White was shot\nin the outbuilding. The prosecutor also emphasized Flack's own statement:\n\n\n               \"And consider finally the defendant's own description of that particular incident.\n       I shot him, he dies. He indicated to law enforcement, I shot him and at the time I shot\n       him, he claims Andrew Stout shot him first, but he indicates that I shot him, he was still\n       alive when I shot him and he dies. Those are the defendant's own words.\"\n\n\n       But while the evidence suggests that White was killed in the outbuilding on Stout's\nproperty, possibly with the shotgun partially recovered from the Emporia dump, major\nuncertainties exist surrounding the timing and circumstances of White's killing. White\nwas last seen alive on April 20, 2013. As Flack points out, jurors heard testimony that\nseveral individuals were at the residence around this time, including Joseph Berger,\nbrothers Andrew and Rocky Helm, Dylan Phillips, Stout, and Flack, among others. Some\nof these guests fired weapons at Stout's property\u2014a \"good shooting spot.\" Jurors also\nheard testimony that White and Stout \"butted heads often.\"\n\n\n       The State highlights evidence that Flack \"discouraged\" his friends from contacting\nthe authorities about White's disappearance. The State highlights circumstantial evidence\nsuggesting that Flack killed Stout, L.B., and K.B., which further implies that Flack also\nkilled White; as the State puts it, Flack \"was the only person of that group to walk away\nfrom the residence alive.\" But while this may be a reasonable extrapolation, it does not\nestablish no reasonable possibility that Flack's confession to killing White affected the\njury's verdict. In particular, the killing of White stands apart in both time and place from\nthe killings of Stout, K.B., and L.B., who were all killed several days after White and\ninside the residence, rather than the outbuilding. In my view, the forensic evidence\nsuggesting Flack's guilt is not overwhelming enough to overcome the prejudicial effect of\n\n                                                   81\n\fhis direct confession to White's murder. Thus, I would reverse his conviction for White's\nmurder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       Stout's Killing\n\n\n       Stout was shot four times with a shotgun, including once in the back. Shell casing\nevidence suggested that the shotgun that was partially recovered from an Emporia\nrecycling center was used in the killing of White, Stout, K.B., and L.B. While Stout was\nfound in the same bedroom as K.B.'s body (where L.B. was also likely shot), the\nevidence suggests he was killed at least a few days before them\u2014between April 28 and\n30, 2013, rather than between May 1 and May 5.\n\n\n       Surveillance camera evidence established that Flack accompanied Stout on a trip\nto Ottawa on April 28. On that trip, Stout wore the same shirt in which he ultimately died.\nCircumstantial evidence suggests that Flack further accompanied Stout to Emporia,\nalthough the surveillance camera evidence is less clear on this point. Yet this evidence\nstill does not directly place Flack at Stout's residence at the time of Stout's killing,\nalthough it may suggest that he was still with Stout at that time. Additionally, Flack's\nfingerprints were present on items in the bedroom where Stout and K.B. were found.\nEvidence also placed Flack at Stout's residence around and after the time Stout was likely\nkilled, and Flack made false statements to others concerning Stout's whereabouts after\nStout's death. For instance, when Phillips stopped by on April 29, he met only Flack, who\ntold him that Stout was running errands before work.\n\n\n       Unlike White's killing, little evidence supported the presence of other individuals\nat the residence\u2014other than Flack\u2014during the timeframe of Stout's killing. Flack's brief\nadmits that evidence existed to establish Flack's presence at the house after Stout's death,\nthat Flack made false statements about seeing Stout after he would have been dead, and\n                                           82\n\fthat Flack \"disposed of the shotgun used to shoot Mr. Stout.\" But Flack points out that\u2014\nother than his statements\u2014there is no evidence he was present at the precise time of\nStout's death, much less that he was the shooter. While that much could be inferred from\nhis later actions\u2014not the least of which was remaining at the house afterward\u2014any such\ninferences cannot overcome the prejudicial impact of the admission of his statements,\nincluding his admission that he was present at the time of Stout's death. Additionally,\nwhile circumstantial evidence could support the inference that Flack was using Stout's\nphone after his death, that inference could not then support a new inference that,\ntherefore, Flack was Stout's killer. Cf. State v. Colson, 312 Kan. 739, 750, 480 P.3d 167\n(2021) (inference stacking is prohibited). Moreover, any error resulting from the\nadmission of Flack's statements vis-\u00e0-vis the killing of White\u2014to which he admitted\u2014\nwould also infect the jury's (otherwise justifiable) inference that Flack was, in fact,\nStout's killer. That the jury ultimately convicted Flack of second-degree murder for\nStout's death further suggests some uncertainty about the circumstances of this killing,\nthough I do not propose to read the tea leaves of the jury's verdict.\n\n\n       Consequently, while the circumstantial evidence supported Flack's conviction for\nStout's murder, it is not overwhelming enough to rule out all reasonable possibility that\nthe erroneous admission of Flack's statements affected the jury's verdict. Thus, I would\nalso reverse Flack's conviction for Stout's murder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       The Killing of L.B. and K.B.\n\n\n       In closing, the prosecutor focused heavily on forensic evidence to establish that\nL.B. and K.B. were killed close in time to one another. But the prosecutor asked jurors to\n\"consider his words to law enforcement\":\n\n\n\n                                             83\n\f       \"He was correctly able to inform law enforcement what the order of death was. Steven\n       White first, Andrew Stout second, [K.B.] third, [L.B.] last. There's only one way that you\n       know that. There's only one way. You were there and you did it.\n\n\n               \"He correctly knew the location of the bodies. He knew that Steven White was in\n       the outbuilding. He knew that Andrew Stout was in the corner. He knew that [K.B.] was\n       buried near the bed. Now he claims he didn't know where [L.B.] was, but he did indicate\n       that she was in a suitcase and that she was wrapped in a blanket. He also correctly\n       described the [s]tate of [K.B.]'s body, her clothing or lack thereof.\n\n\n               \"Now in the defendant's statements to law enforcement there were at least eight\n       versions and there are significant inconsistencies between each of the versions. It's for\n       you to judge and determine and assess the credibility of all those different versions and\n       what inconsistencies there are.\n\n\n               \"But the inconsistencies all have something in common. They are designed to\n       take the focus and responsibility off of the defendant. It's always, you know, Andrew shot\n       Steven White. Oh, Omar and Chewie, they're the ones that shot Andrew Stout and [K.B.]\n       and [L.B.]. I was just there. He puts himself there during the murders but he's always got\n       a little bit less of a responsibility. Yet he has all these details and there's all this evidence\n       that all points to one person and one person alone, the defendant.\"\n\n\n       In my view, the circumstantial evidence here appears strong enough to eliminate\nany reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's insinuation that Flack had \"all these\ndetails\" affected the jury's verdict. Unlike the killing of White and Stout, the evidence\nsurrounding the deaths of L.B. and K.B. effectively rules out any lesser degrees of\nhomicide beyond premeditated first-degree murder. K.B. was gagged, naked from the\nwaist down, and had her hands bound behind her back with zip ties at the time of her\ndeath. She was shot in the back of the neck by a shotgun while prone or kneeling on the\nground. Her body was later turned face up and she was covered with a pile of clothes.\nAfter the clothes were placed atop K.B.'s body, 18-month-old L.B. was shot in the back\n                                                      84\n\fwith a shotgun while facing the direction of her mother's body. Forensic evidence about\nthe contents of K.B.'s and L.B.'s stomachs further suggests that both were killed on the\nafternoon of May 1, 2013.\n\n\n       Moreover, the circumstantial evidence supporting a finding that Flack was directly\ninvolved in the killing of L.B. and K.B. is stronger than that supporting his convictions\nfor the killing of White and Stout. For instance, cell phone data suggested that Flack was\nlikely present at the residence on May 1 and May 2, 2013. On May 3, 2013, cell phone\ndata suggested that Flack began the day at the residence, then moved within a mile-and-a-\nhalf from the place where L.B.'s body was found, and then traveled to Emporia, where his\nphone remained. Flack subsequently got a new phone.\n\n\n       A little after 5 p.m. on May 7, 2013, cameras captured images of an individual\ndriving K.B.'s car to an apartment parking lot near 12th and East streets in Emporia. The\ndriver got out and threw away a bag from the car into a nearby dumpster. The bag\ncontained items belonging to K.B. and L.B., including L.B.'s baby blanket. Douglas\npicked Flack up from the parking lot of Do-B's restaurant sometime after 5 p.m. on the\nevening of May 7, 2013; this parking lot would have been very close to the parking lot\nwhere K.B.'s car was left. Circumstantial evidence thus suggested that Flack was driving\nK.B.'s car and was attempting to dispose of her and L.B.'s property.\n\n\n       Like White and Stout, L.B. and K.B. were killed with a shotgun. Beyond the\nevidence that the shotgun recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014which was\nFlack's\u2014fired several casings recovered from the residence, one of the shot shells fired\nfrom the shotgun was found on K.B.'s leg. Finally, perhaps the strongest circumstantial\nevidence of Flack's involvement in the killings can be found from the black zip ties in\nFlack's bag, which were much like the ones used to bind K.B.\n\n\n                                            85\n\f       Admittedly, the DNA evidence collected from K.B.'s body did not strongly\nimplicate Flack. For instance, the major DNA profile taken from the knot of the bandana\nused to gag K.B. fit K.B.'s DNA, but Flack could not be excluded as the source of the\nminor profile contribution\u2014although that minor profile would be consistent with the\nDNA of one in eight individuals. This evidence further suggested that Flack had touched\nand, perhaps, even tied the bandana used to gag K.B. Further, although Flack could not\nbe excluded as a contributor to samples containing mixed DNA profiles obtained from\nK.B.'s left hand fingernail clippings, this match was also weak\u2014about a 1-in-28 chance.\nMoreover, Flack could be excluded as a contributor to DNA samples collected from\nunder K.B.'s right hand fingernail clippings. No conclusion could be reached as to\nwhether Flack contributed to male DNA recovered from K.B.'s pubic hair.\n\n\n       Despite the somewhat lukewarm DNA evidence, I believe the remaining\ncircumstantial evidence of Flack's guilt is overwhelming enough to render the erroneous\nadmission of his statements harmless as to his conviction for killing L.B. and K.B. These\nkillings occurred close together in time and space and could, realistically, only have\nresulted from intentional and premeditated conduct. Thus, I concur in the result of the\nmajority's decision to affirm Flack's capital murder conviction.\n\n\n       Harmlessness\u2014Penalty Phase\n\n\n       I turn next to the harmlessness of the error in the penalty phase of Flack's trial.\nFlack argues that his statements amplified the State's description of K.B.'s last moments,\neliminated \"residual\" doubt, and made him appear unsympathetic and remorseless before\nthe jury.\n\n\n       But even if Flack's statements did not affect the jury's finding about the existence\nof aggravating circumstances, I find it probable that they affected the jury's weighing of\n                                            86\n\faggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jury watched Flack give the detectives\nseveral versions of events, as the prosecution repeatedly highlighted. This could have led\nthe jury to conclude that Flack was a remorseless killer who deserved to die for his\ncrimes.\n\n\n       Because I find it probable that Flack's statements impacted at least some of the\nindividual jurors' assessment of the mitigating circumstances, I would vacate Flack's\nverdict of death and remand for a new sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n\n       Conclusion\n\n\n       A \"right\" to silence which cannot be exercised in practice\u2014even by actual\nsilence\u2014is no right at all. Because the majority's analysis undermines the exercise of the\nconstitutional right to silence by implicitly penalizing Flack for failing to utter the proper\nincantation\u2014despite his repeated, clear requests that the detectives take him to jail, which\nwould necessarily terminate the interview\u2014I respectfully dissent. All the same, I concur\nin affirming Flack's conviction for capital murder, as I believe the evidence of his guilt to\nbe overwhelming enough to neutralize the prejudicial effect of the erroneous admission\nof Flack's statements. Likewise, I concur with the majority's analysis about Flack's\nremaining claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                              87\n\f","                                       2024 IL 129471\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 129471)\n\n      THE ARLINGTON HEIGHTS POLICE PENSION FUND et al., Appellants,\n           v.

Jan. 1, 2020)\n     (Act), which amended portions of the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5\/1-101 et.\n     seq. (West 2020)), violated article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill.\n     Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5), commonly known as the pension protection clause,\n\f     and\/or article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 15),\n     commonly known as the takings clause. The circuit court granted summary\n     judgment in favor of defendants. The appellate court affirmed. 2023 IL App (2d)\n     220198, \u00b6 20. For the following reasons, we also affirm.\n\n\n\u00b62                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On January 1, 2020, Public Act 101-610 became effective and amended, in\n     pertinent part, portions of the pension code to consolidate all applicable local police\n     and firefighter pension fund assets into two statewide pension investment funds,\n     one for police and the other for firefighters. Pursuant to the Act, the local pension\n     funds were required to transfer custody and investment responsibility for their fund\n     assets to the respective statewide funds, which are now tasked with collectively\n     investing and administering the pooled assets. The Act provided a transition period\n     that ended on June 30, 2022, for the transfer of securities, assets, and the investment\n     function from the local funds to the statewide investment funds. See 40 ILCS\n     5\/22B-120, 22C-120 (West 2020).\n\n\u00b64       Under the Act, each local fund retains a separate account in the respective\n     statewide fund. Those assets are dedicated solely to paying benefits to the local\n     fund\u2019s members and to covering operating expenses. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1-109; 22B-118(c), (e);\n     22C-118(c), (e). The Act specifies that the \u201coperations and financial condition of\n     each participating pension fund account shall not affect the account balance of any\n     other participating pension fund.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-118(c), 22C-118(c). The returns on\n     the investments in the statewide funds are then \u201callocated and distributed pro rata\n     among each participating pension fund account in accordance with the value of the\n     pension fund assets attributable to each fund.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b65       The purpose of the Act is \u201cto streamline investments and eliminate unnecessary\n     and redundant administrative costs, thereby ensuring more money is available to\n     fund pension benefits for the beneficiaries of the transferor pension funds.\u201d Id.\n     \u00a7\u00a7 22B-114, 22C-114. The two investment fund boards created by the Act are\n     composed of nine members: three officers or executives from participating\n     municipalities, three active participants of the local funds who are elected by active\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f     participants, two beneficiaries 1 from the local funds who are elected by\n     beneficiaries of the funds, and one member recommended by the Illinois Municipal\n     League who is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-\n     115(b), 22C-115(b). In addition, the Act authorizes the Illinois Finance Authority\n     (IFA) to lend money, if requested by the local funds, to pay the necessary transition\n     costs to the new statewide funds. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-120(h), 23C-120(h). Any such loans\n     are to be repaid with interest. Id.\n\n\u00b66       There are approximately 650 local police and firefighter pension funds for\n     municipalities in Illinois with populations between 5000 and 500,000, and the Act\n     does not eliminate any of them. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-103, 4-103. These local funds continue\n     to be governed by five-member boards composed of two appointed members, two\n     members elected by active members, and one member elected by and from the\n     beneficiaries. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-128, 4-121. The Act specifically provides that these local\n     boards retain exclusive authority to adjudicate and award retirement and other\n     benefits. The new statewide investment funds \u201cshall not have the authority to\n     control, alter, or modify, or the ability to review or intervene in, the proceedings or\n     decisions\u201d of the local pension boards. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-124.3, 4-117.2. Therefore, the\n     enactment of the Act had no impact on the local pension boards\u2019 responsibility to\n     determine the retirement, disability, and death benefits payable to fund members\n     and other beneficiaries.\n\n\u00b67       In February 2021, plaintiffs, 36 individual active and retired beneficiary\n     members from a small number of suburban and downstate police and firefighter\n     pension funds, filed a three-count complaint against Governor Jay Robert \u201cJ.B.\u201d\n     Pritzker; Christopher Meister, executive director of the IFA; Dana Severinghaus,\n     acting director of the Illinois Department of Insurance; the Board of Trustees for\n     the Police Officers\u2019 Pension Investment Fund; and the Board of Trustees for the\n     Firefighters\u2019 Pension Investment Fund. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive,\n     and other relief, including a finding that the Act violated the pension protection\n     clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5) (count I) and\/or\n\n\n\n          1 The fund board for local police has two members directly from the population of beneficiaries;\n\n     the fund board for firefighters has one beneficiary member and one member recommended by the\n     statewide labor organization representing firefighters from at least 85 municipalities, who is then\n     appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. See id. \u00a7 22C-115(b)(3), (5).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       the Illinois Constitution\u2019s contracts clause (id. art. I, \u00a7 16) (count II) and\/or the\n       Illinois Constitution\u2019s takings clause (id. \u00a7 15) (count III). 2\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the Act diminishes and impairs their pension\n       benefits because, (1) prior to the Act, the local funds could \u201cexclusively manage\n       and control their investment expenditures and income\u201d; (2) their \u201cvoting power and\n       thereby an effective say in the selection of investment managers, investments, risks,\n       rates of return, costs and expenses\u201d was diluted by the participation of members of\n       other local funds; and (3) the local funds must bear the costs associated with the\n       Act\u2019s transition process, including repayment of any IFA transition loans.\n\n\u00b69          On cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court entered judgment in\n       favor of defendants and against plaintiffs. 3 As to count I, the circuit court found\n       that precedent from this court instructs that the \u201cbenefits\u201d protected by the pension\n       protection clause are limited to those that affect the value of a member\u2019s pension\n       benefit. The circuit court found the Act did not violate the clause because plaintiffs\n       were not denied a \u201cbenefit\u201d that could be tied to a change in the value of their\n       retirement payments. As to count III, plaintiffs\u2019 takings clause claim, the circuit\n       court found that, because the clause applies only to government action against real\n       property, which is not at issue here, the Act did not implicate that constitutional\n       provision.\n\n\u00b6 10       On appeal, plaintiffs only challenged the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to counts I and\n       III of the complaint. 2023 IL App (2d) 220198, \u00b6 5. Concerning count I, the\n       appellate court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that voting rights are protected\n       benefits under the pension protection clause. Id. \u00b6 14. The court found that benefits\n       outside of pension payments that have been held to constitute benefits for purposes\n       of the clause are generally only those that affect a participant\u2019s continued\n       participation in a pension system or their ability to increase their service credits,\n       thereby affecting the calculation of eventual benefit payments. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n\n\n           2\n              The complaint also named as plaintiffs 18 local police or firefighter pension funds. The circuit\n       court dismissed these plaintiffs for lack of standing. This ruling was not challenged in the appellate\n       court, nor is it raised in this court.\n            3\n              Prior to the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 countermotion for summary judgment, the circuit court\n       dismissed count II of the complaint after finding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under\n       the contracts clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\f       appellate court concluded that the ability to vote in elections for local pension board\n       members is not such a benefit, nor is the ability to have local board members control\n       and invest pension funds. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 11       The appellate court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Act impairs and\n       diminishes their benefits by requiring local funds to pay startup and administrative\n       costs, as well as transition costs, for the new statewide pension investment funds.\n       Id. \u00b6 15. The court found that plaintiffs failed to explain how such costs impair or\n       diminish payment of their benefits. Id. Additionally, the court noted that the Act\n       does not require the local funds to borrow money to pay for the costs or for them to\n       spend any specific amount. Id.\n\n\u00b6 12       As to count III, the appellate court held that, because plaintiffs have no property\n       right in any particular assets or level of funding and are entitled only to present or\n       future payments from the funds, they could not establish the private property\n       requirement for their takings clause claim. Id. \u00b6 18. The court concluded that\n       plaintiffs do not own the funds that are to be transferred to the new statewide funds.\n       Id.\n\n\u00b6 13       For these reasons, the appellate court held that the circuit court correctly ruled\n       that summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate on counts I and III of\n       the complaint.

Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5).\n       Plaintiffs assert that the Act does not conform to the requirements of this clause\n       because it impairs the rights of members to vote in the election of local police and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       firefighter pension boards and to have those boards control and invest the local\n       pension funds.\n\n\u00b6 17       Summary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine issue of material\n       fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5\/2-\n       1005(c) (West 2020). By filing cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties\n       invite the court to decide the questions presented as a matter of law. Carmichael v.\n       Laborers\u2019 & Retirement Board Employees\u2019 Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago,\n       2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 21. We apply a de novo standard of review to summary judgment\n       rulings. Id.\n\n\n\u00b6 18                               I. Pension Protection Clause\n\n\u00b6 19        Article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution provides that \u201c[m]embership\n       in any pension or retirement system of the State, any unit of local government or\n       school district, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, shall be an enforceable\n       contractual relationship, the benefit of which shall not be diminished or impaired.\u201d\n       Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5.\n\n\u00b6 20        This clause of our constitution has been construed by this court on numerous\n       occasions. We have repeatedly held that the pension protection clause means\n       precisely what it says: \u201cif something qualifies as a benefit of the enforceable\n       contractual relationship resulting from membership in one of the State\u2019s pension or\n       retirement systems, it cannot be diminished or impaired.\u201d Kanerva v. Weems, 2014\n       IL 115811, \u00b6 38; id. \u00b6 40 (holding that subsidized health care provided to state\n       employees was a benefit of membership in a state retirement system protected by\n       the pension protection clause). The protections afforded to pension benefits by\n       article XIII, section 5, attach once an individual first embarks upon employment in\n       a position covered by a public retirement system, not when the employee ultimately\n       retires. In re Pension Reform Litigation, 2015 IL 118585, \u00b6 46. Those benefits\n       therefore cannot be later unilaterally diminished or eliminated by the legislature.\n       Id. \u00b6 46 n.12.\n\n\u00b6 21        Accordingly, once an individual begins work and becomes a member of a public\n       retirement system, any subsequent changes to the Pension Code that would\n       diminish the benefits conferred by membership in the retirement system cannot be\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       applied to that individual. Id. \u00b6 46. \u201cThe primary purpose of article XIII, section 5,\n       was to eliminate any uncertainty surrounding the payment of public pension\n       benefits and to clarify that state and local governments were obligated to provide\n       pension benefits to their employees.\u201d Matthews v. Chicago Transit Authority, 2016\n       IL 117638, \u00b6 57.\n\n\u00b6 22       This court has further explained that the pension protection clause \u201c \u2018protects\n       all of the benefits that flow from the contractual relationship arising from\n       membership in a public retirement system.\u2019 \u201d Williamson County Board of\n       Commissioners v. Board of Trustees of the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund,\n       2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 32 (quoting Matthews, 2016 IL 117638, \u00b6 54). The benefits\n       protected include \u201cthose benefits attendant to membership in the State\u2019s retirement\n       system, such as subsidized health care, disability and life insurance coverage, and\n       eligibility to receive a retirement annuity and survivor benefit [citations], along\n       with the right to purchase optional service credit in the state pension system for past\n       military service.\u201d Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 25.\n\n\u00b6 23       Plaintiffs claim that the lower courts failed to appreciate this precedent and the\n       breadth of the phrase \u201cany benefit\u201d contained in our pension protection clause.\n       Plaintiffs argue that their voting rights are impacted by the Act and that voting\n       rights are a benefit that cannot be altered. They assert that prior to the adoption of\n       the Act they had the right to vote and exercise greater control over locally managed\n       boards and pension funds. The Act, according to plaintiffs, \u201csubstantially impacted\n       and diluted\u201d their voting rights and their rights to control the management of the\n       funds. Consequently, plaintiffs claim it was erroneous for the lower courts to find\n       that these rights were not the kind of benefits protected by our constitution.\n\n\u00b6 24       In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely heavily upon Williamson County.\n       There, the plaintiffs were elected members of the Williamson County Board of\n       Commissioners and had satisfied the requirements of the Pension Code to\n       participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF). Williamson County,\n       2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 5. The Pension Code was subsequently amended to add a\n       requirement for a county board to adopt an IMRF participation resolution within 90\n       days of each election when a member of the county board is elected or reelected.\n       Id. \u00b6 8. The Williamson County Board failed to adopt such a resolution within the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       required time frame, and the plaintiffs\u2019 participation in IMRF was terminated. Id.\n       \u00b6 12.\n\n\u00b6 25       This court found that the amendment to the Pension Code was unconstitutional\n       because the legislature\u2019s unilateral decision to create the provision contained in\n       section 7-137.2(a) (40 ILCS 5\/7-137.2(a) (West 2016)) imposed a new requirement\n       for continued IMRF participation that did not exist when the plaintiffs began their\n       public employment. Williamson County, 2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 47. The defendants did\n       not contest the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they would qualify for continued\n       participation in the fund but for the new requirement that all county boards certify\n       within 90 days of each general election that their county board members are\n       required to work sufficient hours to meet the applicable hourly standard. Id.\n\n\u00b6 26       Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Williamson County is misplaced. There, the newly\n       created requirement in the Pension Code could eliminate the monetary benefits of\n       members and did not exist when the plaintiffs began their public employment and\n       participation in IMRF. Therefore, in marked contrast to the instant case, the\n       constitutional violation in the new legislation in Williamson County was\n       specifically tied to its effect of eliminating monetary benefits for existing members.\n\n\u00b6 27       Generally, as the appellate court below recognized, the benefits outside of\n       pension payments that have been found to constitute benefits for purposes of the\n       pension protection clause are those that affect a participant\u2019s ability to continue\n       participation or increase service credits, thereby negatively affecting calculation of\n       eventual benefit payments. See, e.g., Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 65 (holding\n       that amendment to the Pension Code that eliminated the ability of the plaintiffs to\n       purchase service credit during a leave of absence to work for a local union was an\n       improper new requirement placed on pension benefits); Buddell v. Board of\n       Trustees, State University Retirement System, 118 Ill. 2d 99, 106-07 (1987)\n       (holding that change to employees\u2019 right to purchase optional service credit for time\n       spent in military service was an improper new requirement placed on pension\n       benefits). In Carmichael, we also listed, as examples of the benefits protected by\n       the pension protection clause, \u201csubsidized health care, disability and life insurance\n       coverage, and eligibility to receive a retirement annuity and survivor benefits.\u201d\n       Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 25.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f\u00b6 28       In contrast, the ability to vote in elections for local pension board members is\n       not such a constitutionally protected benefit, nor is the ability to have local board\n       members control and invest pension funds. See Kanerva, 2014 IL 115811, \u00b6 48\n       (holding that the pension protection clause was aimed at protecting the right to\n       receive the promised retirement benefits, not the adequacy of the funding to pay for\n       them); McNamee v. State, 173 Ill. 2d 433, 444 (1996) (holding that the pension\n       protection clause does not create a contractual basis for participants to expect a\n       particular level of funding but only a contractual right that they would receive the\n       money due them at the time of their retirement).\n\n\u00b6 29       It is axiomatic that, if plaintiffs have no constitutional right in how their local\n       pension funds are funded or the adequacy of that funding, they similarly have no\n       constitutional right regarding who invests local fund assets. The Act does not\n       change plaintiffs\u2019 right to elect members of their local funds\u2019 boards or the local\n       boards\u2019 authority to determine the amount of benefits plaintiffs are entitled to\n       receive. It only changes the local boards\u2019 power to invest the assets of the local\n       funds. Simply put, the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code has no impact on\n       plaintiffs receiving their promised monetary benefits.\n\n\u00b6 30       Plaintiffs further argue that the Act impairs and diminishes their benefits in\n       violation of the pension protection clause by requiring local funds to pay start-up,\n       administration, and operation costs for the new funds, plus interest if any amount\n       is borrowed from the IFA. Plaintiffs argue that the appellate court ignored this\n       concern by stating that the funds must already pay administration costs and that\n       there is no evidence that the costs of the new funds would be any greater. Plaintiffs\n       assert that these liabilities and encumbrances did not exist before the Act and\n       constitute a further violation of the pension protection clause.\n\n\u00b6 31       This contention also lacks merit. Plaintiffs do not explain how the payment of\n       the startup costs impairs or diminishes payment of their pension benefits. The Act\n       does not require the borrowing or the spending of any specific amount for the\n       startup or administrative costs of the funds. Additionally, as previously noted, the\n       two new statewide funds are intended to streamline investments and eliminate\n       unnecessary and redundant costs, thereby ensuring that more money is available to\n       fund local police and firefighter pension benefits. See 40 ILCS 5\/22B-114, 22C-\n       114 (West 2020).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f\u00b6 32       For these reasons, we find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment\n       in defendants\u2019 favor on count I of the complaint.\n\n\n\u00b6 33                                     II. Takings Clause\n\n\u00b6 34       We next turn to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the circuit court erred in granting\n       defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because the Act violates the takings\n       clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 15). Plaintiffs contend\n       that, because the Act requires them \u201cto fully transfer all of their private property,\n       comprised of their securities, funds, assets, monies, and cash reserves\u201d to the\n       statewide pension investment funds, and because the Act requires them to bear the\n       financial costs of transition, as well as to pay the costs and expenses incurred in the\n       operation and administration of the funds, their private property has been taken\n       and\/or damaged in violation of the takings clause.\n\n\u00b6 35       Article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution provides that \u201c[p]rivate\n       property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation as\n       provided by law. Such compensation shall be determined by a jury as provided by\n       law.\u201d Id. We have defined a taking as \u201ca physical invasion of private property or\n       the radical interference with a private property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of the\n       property.\u201d Tzakis v. Maine Township, 2020 IL 125017, \u00b6 45. \u201cOne of the principal\n       purposes of the Takings Clause is \u2018to bar Government from forcing some people\n       alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by\n       the public as a whole.\u2019 \u201d Northern Illinois Home Builders Ass\u2019n v. County of\n       Du Page, 165 Ill. 2d 25, 31-32 (1995) (quoting Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S.\n       374, 384 (1994)).\n\n\u00b6 36       As the appellate court correctly concluded, the Act does not take any of\n       plaintiffs\u2019 private property. As participants in a defined benefit plan, they have a\n       right to receive their promised benefits but do not somehow have a private property\n       right in the source of funding for those payments. Plaintiffs claim that the Act\n       requires them to fully transfer ownership of their private property, comprising the\n       securities and other fund assets. The Act does not operate in that manner. It simply\n       changes the control and management of the local funds\u2019 assets from one\n       government-created pension fund to another type of government-created pension\n       fund. As defendants assert, although plaintiffs have a constitutional right to receive\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       the benefit payments promised to them, which the Act does not change, they do not\n       have a property right to any particular level of assets used to pay those benefits or\n       in the way those assets are held or invested.\n\n\u00b6 37       Plaintiffs have failed to identify any property right under Illinois law that is\n       affected by the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code. It is undisputed that the Act\n       does not impact the pension payments that plaintiffs are entitled to receive.\n       Additionally, as defendants recognize, plaintiffs\u2019 takings claim must also fail\n       because even if they had a property right in the local funds\u2019 assets, which they do\n       not, the Act would not constitute a taking of that property for the government\u2019s use.\n       The Act simply changes how local fund assets are managed and invested without\n       affecting the ultimate use of those assets to pay the benefits of local fund members.\n\n\u00b6 38      Consequently, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in\n       defendants\u2019 favor on count III of the complaint.\n\n\n\u00b6 39                                    CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 40       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court\n       affirming the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor\n       and against plaintiffs.\n\n\n\u00b6 41      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\f","                                        2024 IL 129164\n\n\n\n                                           IN THE\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                            THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                      (Docket No. 129164)\n\n THE CITY OF ROCK FALLS, Appellee, v.

The petition sought to compel Aims\u2019s\n      compliance with a City ordinance requiring that, upon the sale or transfer of any\n      property located within the City limits that is served by a private sewage disposal\n      system, the private system be abandoned and replaced with a connection to the\n\f     City\u2019s public sewage disposal system. Following a bench trial, the trial court\n     determined that it would be inequitable to award the City an injunction and, on that\n     basis, denied the City\u2019s petition. The appellate court reversed the trial court, holding\n     that, because the City sought the enforcement of an ordinance that specifically\n     authorized injunctive relief, the trial court erred in weighing the equities when\n     deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s petition. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U. For the\n     reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On March 3, 2017, Aims purchased a commercial property located within the\n     City at 2103 Industrial Park Road. The property was serviced by a private sewage\n     disposal system rather than the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n\n\u00b64       At the time Aims purchased the property, it was governed by section 32-189(g)\n     of the Rock Falls Municipal Code (Code). This provision states:\n\n            \u201cUpon sale or transfer of property all private sewage disposal systems\n        within the city limits shall connect to the public sanitary sewer when available\n        in accordance with sections 32-186 and 32-190, a direct connection shall be\n        made to the public sewer, and the private sewage disposal system shall be\n        abandoned and shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with granular materials.\n        The county health department shall be notified and inspect the abandoned septic\n        system prior to any remedial actions being taken.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code,\n        \u00a7 32-189(g) (eff.

These provisions state:\n\n            \u201cNo person having his residence or place of business within the territorial\n        limits of the city shall be permitted to dispose of sewage of such residence or\n        place of business located in the city otherwise than through the sewer mains of\n        the city whenever the sewer mains of the sewerage system of the city are\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f        adjacent to his property, without the written permission of the council.\u201d Rock\n        Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-186 (adopted July 7, 2015).\n\n             \u201cThe owner of each house, building or property used for human occupancy,\n        employment, recreation or any other purpose, situated within the city is\n        required, at his expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein, meeting the\n        requirements of the state *** plumbing code, and to connect such facilities\n        directly with the public wastewater treatment system in accordance with the\n        provisions of this division, and within 60 days after official notice to so connect.\n        This provision shall be effective provided that there [is] a wastewater treatment\n        system main located: (i) within 300 feet of the property line of a property\n        utilized for residential purposes; (ii) within 300 feet of the property line of a\n        property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow of\n        less than 1,500 gallons per day; or, (iii) within 1,000 feet of the property line of\n        a property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow\n        of 1,500 gallons per day or greater.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-190 (eff.\n        Sept. 15, 2015).\n\n\u00b66        In addition, section 1-41(n) of the Code authorizes the City to seek injunctive\n     relief for continuous violations of the Code:\n\n        \u201cViolations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public\n        nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief.

July 5, 2017).\n\n\u00b67       Following its purchase of the property, Aims was notified by the City that it\n     was required to connect to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system pursuant to\n     section 32-189(g) of the Code. However, Aims did not do so.\n\n\u00b68       Thereafter, on August 5, 2019, the City filed a verified petition for injunctive\n     and other relief to compel Aims\u2019s compliance with the sewage disposal provisions\n     of the Code. The petition sought the imposition of a fine as well as a mandatory\n     injunction requiring Aims to abandon its private sewage disposal system and\n     connect to the public sewage disposal system by a date certain to be determined by\n     the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f\u00b69         The case proceeded to a bench trial. Nathan Simonton, an estimator from a civil\n       engineering firm, testified regarding the construction work that would be required\n       to connect the property to the public sewage disposal system as well as the\n       estimated cost for such work. He stated that it would cost approximately $150,000\n       to connect the property to the public sewer using a gravity system of waste disposal.\n       This included the cost of installing lateral connectors\u2014sewage lines that run from\n       a property to the main sewer line. He also stated that an alternative method of\n       connection involving the use of an electric pump would cost approximately\n       $51,000.\n\n\u00b6 10       Robin Blackert, the City\u2019s administrator, testified that in 2020 the City\n       approved an ordinance pursuant to section 32-186 of the Code that excused another\n       business located within the City from the requirement of connecting to the public\n       sewage system. According to Blackert, the City passed the ordinance because\n       connecting to the public sewage disposal system would have been cost prohibitive\n       and an undue hardship on the business. Aims had sought a similar exclusion from\n       the City prior to trial but was denied.\n\n\u00b6 11       At the conclusion of trial, the trial court noted that, while the City had requested\n       the imposition of a fine in its petition, that request had effectively been abandoned\n       during the proceedings and the only question before the court was whether\n       injunctive relief was appropriate. On that issue, the trial court found that section\n       32-189(g) of the Code had been triggered by Aims\u2019s purchase of the property in\n       2017 and that Aims had not connected to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n       The court further found that the City had met its burden of establishing that a public\n       sewer with a daily sewage flow of less than 1500 gallons per day was located within\n       300 feet of the property, as required for the sewer to be considered \u201cavailable\u201d for\n       connection within the meaning of section 32-189(g), and that Aims had not been\n       granted the City council\u2019s written permission to continue the use of its private\n       sewage disposal. Nevertheless, the court denied the City\u2019s petition.\n\n\u00b6 12       Emphasizing that it was \u201csitting as a court in equity,\u201d the trial court determined\n       that it was required to balance the equities between the parties when ruling on the\n       City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The court noted that no evidence had been\n       produced to show that Aims\u2019s private sewage system was failing or that it presented\n       a threat to public health. The court also noted that connecting to the public sewage\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f       disposal system would be expensive, imposing a hardship on Aims, and that the\n       City had granted an exception to another commercial property owner in the past. In\n       addition, although the trial court found it \u201creasonable\u201d for the City to require\n       property owners to connect to the public sewage system, the court stated it had \u201ca\n       hard time understanding\u201d why the sale or transfer of a property triggered that\n       requirement. The court concluded: \u201cHaving done what can be called the balancing\n       in equity, because that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about, the fairness to everybody,\n       the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief is denied.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 13       The City appealed, arguing that the trial court had no authority to balance the\n       equities when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The\n       appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. 2022 IL App\n       (4th) 220208-U.\n\n\u00b6 14       Before addressing the availability of injunctive relief, the appellate court noted\n       that language in the trial court\u2019s order indicated that it had both incorporated a\n       comparative cost analysis and had considered the absence of lateral connectors\n       when determining whether a connection to the public sewage disposal system was\n       \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of the Code. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21-32. The appellate court\n       concluded that this was error and that the availability of a connection was defined\n       solely under the terms of sections 32-186 and 32-190 of the Code. Id. \u00b6 32. The\n       appellate court further held that the requirements of both these provisions had been\n       established by the City. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n\u00b6 15        The appellate court then addressed \u201cwhether it was appropriate for the trial\n       court to balance the hardships when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request\n       for injunctive relief.\u201d Id. \u00b6 42. The appellate court acknowledged that, when a suit\n       is brought in equity seeking injunctive relief, the general rule is that the trial court\n       must balance the equities between the parties. Id. \u00b6 44. The court stated, however,\n       that \u201cwhere a governmental agency is expressly authorized by statute to seek\n       injunctive relief, the traditional equitable elements necessary to obtain an injunction\n       need not be satisfied.\u201d Id. \u00b6 45. Relying upon People ex rel. Sherman v. Cryns, 203\n       Ill. 2d 264 (2003), and Sadat v. American Motors Corp., 104 Ill. 2d 105 (1984), the\n       appellate court explained that, because there is a presumption of harm to the public\n       when an ordinance is violated, a governmental agency seeking an injunction need\n       only show that the ordinance was violated and that the ordinance specifically\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       provides for injunctive relief. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U, \u00b6 45. The court\n       concluded, therefore, in this case, that the City had to prove only that Aims violated\n       the Code and that the Code specifically authorized injunctive relief as a remedy. Id.\n       \u00b6 50. As such, the construction work and cost required to connect to the City\u2019s\n       sewage system, as well as the exemption granted to the other business, were\n       irrelevant. Id. In reaching this result, the appellate court declined to follow County\n       of Kendall v. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App. 3d 529, 539 (2004), wherein the court held\n       that a trial court may balance the equities even when a statute expressly authorizes\n       a governmental agency to seek injunctive relief. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U, \u00b6 49.\n\n\u00b6 16       We allowed Aims\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff. Oct.\n       1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                                        ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 18       Before this court, Aims does not challenge the appellate court\u2019s holding that a\n       connection to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system was available within the\n       meaning of the Code. Instead, Aims contends only that the appellate court erred in\n       holding that the trial court lacked the authority to weigh the equities when ruling\n       on the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The City, in response, contends that the\n       appellate court correctly determined that the trial court lacked any such authority.\n\n\u00b6 19       The City does not dispute that, when a suit is filed in equity seeking mandatory\n       injunctive relief, the moving party must establish that it has no adequate remedy at\n       law, that it possesses a certain and clearly ascertainable right, and that it will suffer\n       irreparable harm if no relief is granted. See, e.g., Sadat, 104 Ill. 2d at 116. In\n       addition, the trial court is generally required to balance the equities before awarding\n       the injunction. See, e.g., Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 86 Ill. 2d 1,\n       28-29 (1981) (citing Haack v. Lindsay Light & Chemical Co., 393 Ill. 367, 375\n       (1946)). The City points out, however, in this case the City did not file a suit in\n       equity but at law, and its petition sought an injunction pursuant to the Code rather\n       than the trial court\u2019s inherent equitable authority. Given this fact, the City contends\n       that the trial court\u2019s discretion was limited by the rule set forth by this court in\n       Cryns.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f\u00b6 20       In Cryns, the Director of Professional Regulation filed a verified petition for\n       injunctive relief alleging that the defendant, a lay midwife, had violated the Nursing\n       and Advanced Practice Nursing Act (225 ILCS 65\/20-75(a) (West 2000)). Cryns,\n       203 Ill. 2d at 266. The section of the statute that authorized injunctive relief\n       provided:\n\n          \u201cIf any person violates the provision of this Act, the Director may, in the name\n          of the People of the State of Illinois, through the Attorney General of the State\n          of Illinois, or the State\u2019s Attorney of any county in which the action is brought,\n          petition for an order enjoining such violation or for an order enforcing\n          compliance with this Act. Upon the filing of a verified petition in court, the\n          court may issue a temporary restraining order, without notice or bond, and may\n          preliminarily and permanently enjoin such violation ***.\u201d 225 ILCS 65\/20-\n          75(a) (West 2000).\n\n       Addressing the availability of injunctive relief under this provision, this court\n       explained the standard to be applied:\n\n          \u201cUnder section 20-75 of the Act (225 ILCS 65\/20-75 (West 2000)), the Director\n          is authorized to petition the circuit court for an injunction against any individual\n          who is practicing nursing without a license. Where, as here, the State or a\n          governmental agency is expressly authorized by statute to seek injunctive relief,\n          the traditional equitable elements necessary to obtain an injunction need not be\n          satisfied. Sadat v. American Motors Corp., 104 Ill. 2d 105, 111-13 (1984); see\n          People v. Van Tran Electric Corp., 152 Ill. App. 3d 175, 184 (1987); People\n          ex rel. Hartigan v. Stianos, 131 Ill. App. 3d 575, 580 (1985). The State or the\n          agency seeking the injunction need only show that the statute was violated and\n          that the statute relied upon specifically allows injunctive relief. Sadat, 104 Ill.\n          2d at 111-13; see Midland Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Elmhurst, 226 Ill. App.\n          3d 494, 504 (1993). This principle of law is animated by the rationale that\n          because statutes authorizing injunctive relief often do so on behalf of a public\n          official in his or her capacity as the enforcer of a regulatory scheme, \u2018the\n          violation of such a statute implies an injury to the general public [and] [s]uch\n          injury necessitates the statutory authorization for equitable relief and supplants\n          the traditional equitable pleading requirements.\u2019 Sadat, 104 Ill. 2d at 113. It is\n          presumed that public harm occurs when a statute is violated. See Midland, 226\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f          Ill. App. 3d at 504; Stianos, 131 Ill. App. 3d at 580 (\u2018The principle underlying\n          the willingness of the courts to issue statutory injunctions to public bodies to\n          restrain violations of a statute is that harm to the public at large can be presumed\n          from the statutory violation alone\u2019). Once it has been established that a statute\n          has been violated, no discretion is vested in the circuit court to refuse to grant\n          the injunctive relief authorized by that statute. See Midland, 226 Ill. App. 3d at\n          504.\u201d Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d at 277-78.\n\n\u00b6 21       Cryns recognized the distinction between a suit seeking injunctive relief\n       pursuant to a court\u2019s inherent equitable authority and one seeking relief pursuant to\n       a statute. In the latter situation, the equities have, in effect, already been balanced\n       by the legislative body, and that balance is reflected in the policy choices contained\n       within the statute. A court is not free to disregard or \u201crebalance\u201d the policy\n       determinations made by a legislative body. See, e.g., Roselle Police Pension Board\n       v. Village of Roselle, 232 Ill. 2d 546, 557 (2009). Accordingly, when a trial court is\n       confronted \u201cwith a continuing violation of statutory law, it has no discretion or\n       authority to balance the equities so as to permit that violation to continue.\u201d Zygmunt\n       J.B. Plater, Statutory Violations and Equitable Discretion, 70 Cal. L. Rev. 524, 527\n       (1982); see also, e.g., 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions \u00a7 25 (October 2023 Update) (\u201cA\n       statutory request for injunctive relief is governed by the requirements of the statute,\n       and express statutory language supersedes common-law requirements.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 22       Aims briefly contends that Cryns is inapposite because that case concerned the\n       application of a statute rather than, as in this case, municipal ordinances. We\n       disagree. It is well settled that \u201c[a] municipal ordinance has the force of law over\n       the community in which it is adopted and, within the corporate limits, operates as\n       effectively as a law passed by the legislature.\u201d City of Chicago v. Roman, 184 Ill.\n       2d 504, 511 (1998). Like a statute, the sewage ordinances at issue in this case were\n       enacted by a legislative body and have the full force of law. Moreover, there has\n       been no suggestion that the ordinances are in some manner unconstitutional or\n       otherwise improper. See, e.g., Hutchinson v. City of Valdosta, 227 U.S. 303, 308\n       (1913) (noting that \u201c[i]t is the commonest exercise of the police power of a State or\n       city to provide for a system of sewers and to compel property owners to connect\n       therewith\u201d). We conclude that Cryns applies to the municipal ordinances at issue\n       here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f\u00b6 23        Aims also cites the appellate court\u2019s decision in Rosenwinkel in support of its\n       contention that the trial court in this case had the authority to balance the equities.\n       At issue in Rosenwinkel was whether the plaintiff, the County of Kendall, was\n       entitled to a mandatory injunction ordering the removal of a grain bin that had been\n       constructed in violation of a county zoning ordinance. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App.\n       3d at 532. Addressing the legal standard to be applied, the appellate court\n       acknowledged this court\u2019s decision in Cryns. Id. at 539. However, the appellate\n       court read Cryns as holding that a law authorizing injunctive relief only relieves the\n       governmental body of proving the \u201cthree traditional elements\u201d for an injunction,\n       i.e., a lack of an adequate remedy at law, a certain and clearly ascertainable right,\n       and irreparable harm if no relief is granted. Id. at 539-40. Thus, according to\n       Rosenwinkel, even in those situations where a law authorizes a governmental body\n       to seek a mandatory injunction and a violation of that law has been proven, the trial\n       court must still balance the equities before granting injunctive relief. Id. at 539. This\n       is incorrect.\n\n\u00b6 24       Cryns was explicit in holding that, \u201c[o]nce it has been established that a statute\n       has been violated, no discretion is vested in the circuit court to refuse to grant the\n       injunctive relief authorized by that statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d at\n       278. Further, Rosenwinkel\u2019s conclusion that a trial court must balance the equities,\n       even if a law expressly providing for injunctive relief has been violated, cannot\n       stand. Such a rule would effectively permit a trial court to second-guess the\n       legislative body as to whether a particular regulatory scheme was equitable or\n       otherwise in the best interests of the public, even though such decisions fall\n       squarely within the realm of legislative determinations. See, e.g., Fumarolo v.\n       Chicago Board of Education, 142 Ill. 2d 54, 62-63 (1990) (it is not for the judiciary\n       to decide the \u201cwisdom or unwisdom of legislative action in determining the means\n       to be adopted to resolve an existing social problem\u201d).\n           Rosenwinkel cited Midland Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Elmhurst, 226 Ill. App.\n       3d 494, 504 (1993), in support of its holding that a trial court is always required to\n       balance the equities. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App. 3d at 539. However, as the\n       appellate court below correctly noted, Midland does not stand for the proposition\n       that a trial court may engage in an \u201copen-ended balancing of the equities in a case\n       seeking enforcement of a municipal ordinance.\u201d 2022 IL App (4th) 220208, \u00b6 48.\n       Indeed, Midlands was cited by this court in Cryns in support of the rule that a trial\n       court has \u201cno discretion\u201d to refuse to grant injunctive relief once it has been\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f       established that a statute authorizing such relief has been violated. Cryns, 203 Ill.\n       2d at 278.\n\n\u00b6 25       Rosenwinkel\u2019s holding that a trial court must balance the equities even under a\n       statute that expressly provides for injunctive relief cannot be reconciled with this\n       court\u2019s decision in Cryns. Accordingly, to the extent that Rosenwinkel conflicts\n       with Cryns, it is overruled.\n\n\u00b6 26       In this case, section 1-41(n) of the Code expressly authorized the City to seek\n       injunctive relief for continuous violations of the City\u2019s sewage ordinances,\n       including the failure to connect to the public sewage disposal system. Thus, the only\n       question to be determined by the trial court was whether the City had met its burden\n       of establishing a continuous violation (id. at 277-78), and the appellate court\n       correctly held that the trial court had no discretion to balance the equities. The\n       judgment of the appellate court reversing the judgment of the trial court is therefore\n       affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 27                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 28      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 29      Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 30      Circuit court judgment reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f","                                      2024 IL 129155\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 129155)\n\n      In re MARRIAGE OF MASUD M.

Mar. 8, 2016), the appellate court had jurisdiction\n     to consider prior orders denying appellant\u2019s petition and motion for substitution of\n     judge. For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment\n\f     concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the petition and motion.\n\n\n\u00b62                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       This appeal takes place in the context of a dissolution proceeding that has\n     remained ongoing for well over a decade. In 2009, petitioner, Masud M. Arjmand,\n     filed a petition to dissolve his marriage to respondent, Muneeza R. Arjmand. The\n     same year, the circuit court entered a judgment for dissolution of marriage that\n     incorporated the parties\u2019 marital settlement agreement. However, in 2011\n     respondent filed a petition to vacate the dissolution judgment pursuant to section 2-\n     1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILC 5\/2-1401 (West 2010)), alleging that\n     the judgment was unconscionable because the marital settlement agreement was\n     secured by coercion and fraudulent concealment of income and assets. The circuit\n     court, via Judge Timothy J. McJoynt, granted the petition in 2012, leaving in place\n     only the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling and sought to stay the proceedings\n     in the circuit court while the appeal was pending. In February 2013, the circuit court\n     granted petitioner\u2019s motion and, \u201cas a condition of bond,\u201d restricted the parties\u2019\n     ability to encumber or dispose of certain investment assets that they owned before\n     the entry of the initial dissolution judgment, including stocks and funds held in\n     brokerage accounts.\n\n\u00b65      The appellate court entered an order in October 2013 affirming the circuit\n     court\u2019s grant of respondent\u2019s section 2-1401 petition. In re Marriage of Arjmand,\n     2013 IL App (2d) 120639.\n\n\u00b66       In July 2014, respondent\u2019s attorney, Bryan Estes of the Stogsdill Law Firm\n     (collectively, the Stogsdill defendants) sent a letter to Morgan Stanley Smith\n     Barney, LLC (Morgan Stanley), enclosing a copy of the February 2013 order and\n     requesting compliance with the order. Morgan Stanley then restricted petitioner\u2019s\n     access to the assets that he held with the company.\n\n\u00b67       In April 2015, Morgan Stanley sought to intervene in the dissolution case to\n     clarify the February 2013 order with respect to petitioner\u2019s accounts, as the parties\n     had made conflicting demands regarding the accounts. The circuit court tabled the\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       request pending resolution of several appeals by petitioner related to the February\n       2013 order.\n\n\u00b68         In August 2015, petitioner filed a complaint in the Cook County circuit court\n       against Morgan Stanley and several affiliated entities (collectively, the Morgan\n       Stanley defendants) and the Stogsdill defendants, alleging various causes of action\n       stemming from the restriction of petitioner\u2019s access to his assets. Petitioner alleged\n       significant damages resulting from, among other things, being unable to pay\n       substantial business and personal obligations. The action was transferred to the\n       Du Page County circuit court, where it was dismissed with prejudice by Judge\n       Ronald Sutter in August 2016 as an improper collateral attack on an order entered\n       in the dissolution proceeding.\n\n\u00b69         In December 2017, Judge McJoynt found that Accenture Founders Shares stock\n       that petitioner held with Morgan Stanley was his nonmarital asset but that the\n       injunctive portions of the February 2013 order remained in full force and effect as\n       to petitioner and respondent only.\n\n\u00b6 10       Petitioner filed a petition under section 2-1401 in August 2018 seeking to\n       partially vacate the August 2016 order. Judge Sutter denied the petition, and the\n       appellate court affirmed the ruling. Arjmand v. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC,\n       2019 IL App (2d) 180785-U.\n\n\u00b6 11      On December 23, 2019, petitioner filed a new complaint, within the dissolution\n       proceeding, against the Morgan Stanley and Stogsdill defendants (collectively\n       defendants), raising largely the same claims.\n\n\u00b6 12      Days later, on December 27, 2019, petitioner filed a \u201cThird Petition for\n       Substitution of Judge [f]or Cause and for Assignment to a Judge in a Different\n       Appellate District,\u201d pursuant to section 2-1001(a)(3)(ii) (735 ILCS 5\/2-\n       1001(a)(3)(ii) (West 2018)) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 1 The petition\n       contained many allegations regarding the restriction of petitioner\u2019s Morgan Stanley\n       account. Petitioner filed an amended petition for substitution the following month.\n       Judge McJoynt ruled that there could be cause if petitioner\u2019s allegations were\n       accepted as true, such that he would have another judge rule on the petition. Judge\n\n           1\n            Petitioner filed his first petition for substitution of judge for cause in February 2014 and his\n       second petition for substitution of judge for cause in December 2014. Both petitions were denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      -3-\n\f       Robert Kleeman denied the petition on June 3, 2020, and he later denied petitioner\u2019s\n       motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 13       Petitioner then filed, on July 6, 2020, a \u201cMotion for Substitution of Judge as of\n       Right or Alternatively for Recusal as to [Morgan Stanley] Complaint.\u201d See id. \u00a7 2-\n       1001(a)(2)(ii). Judge McJoynt denied the motion on August 6, 2020, on the basis\n       that he had already made hundreds of substantive rulings in the dissolution case and\n       there was no evidence of interest, bias, or prejudice. He subsequently denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 14       On November 19, 2020, Judge McJoynt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\n       the complaint against them with prejudice, based on res judicata from Judge\n       Sutter\u2019s ruling. He also granted the Morgan Stanley defendants\u2019 request to dismiss\n       two counts with prejudice for failing to state a claim against those defendants.\n       Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which Judge McJoynt denied on April 28,\n       2021. The order contained findings under Rule 304(a) that there was no just reason\n       for delaying enforcement or appeal of the denial of the motion to reconsider and\n       the November 19, 2020, dismissal order, nunc pro tunc. Petitioner filed a timely\n       notice of appeal, citing the April 2021 order and \u201call orders in [the] procedural\n       progression leading to it.\u201d He stated that he sought reversal of the April 2021 order\n       and the November 2020 dismissal order.\n\n\u00b6 15       In a summary order, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in\n       dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint as barred by res judicata, because Judge Sutter\u2019s\n       2016 dismissal was not based on the merits of the claims. No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 10\n       (2022) (unpublished summary order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23(c)). It\n       remanded the case for the circuit court to consider whether the dismissal was proper\n       on any other grounds. Id. \u00b6 11. This portion of the judgment is not at issue here.\n\n\u00b6 16       Petitioner also challenged the denials of his petition and motion for substitution\n       of judge. The appellate court stated that there was no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       allowing for an interlocutory appeal from the denials of the substitution requests.\n       Id. \u00b6 12. Therefore, they could be reviewed only on appeal from a final order. Id.\n       Petitioner relied on Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d\n       184, 186-87 (1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 179 Ill. 2d 1 (1997), where the\n       Appellate Court, Fourth District, held that it could review a decision on a motion\n       for substitution of judge in conjunction with an interlocutory appeal under Illinois\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f       Supreme Court Rule 307 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). The appellate court here stated that\n       Berlin was from another appellate district and therefore not binding on the court.\n       No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 13. The appellate court instead relied on the Second District case\n       In re Marriage of Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d 961, 970-71 (2004), which disagreed\n       with Berlin on the basis that Illinois Supreme Court rules do not allow review of\n       such orders in interlocutory appeals. No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 13. The appellate court\n       therefore concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the rulings on the petition and\n       motion for substitution of judge. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 17       We granted petitioner leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n       We allowed the Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers\n       to file an amicus curiae brief in support of petitioner\u2019s position. See Ill. S. Ct. R.\n       345 (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 18                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 19       The Illinois Constitution grants the appellate court jurisdiction to hear appeals\n       from final judgments of the circuit courts. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. The\n       constitution further allows this court to \u201cprovide by rule for appeals to the Appellate\n       Court from other than final judgments of Circuit Courts.\u201d Id. Therefore, the\n       appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review judgments, orders, or decrees that are\n       not final, unless an Illinois Supreme Court rule provides for jurisdiction. Johnson\n       v. Armstrong, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 20       In this case, petitioner appealed pursuant to Rule 304(a), which states in\n       relevant part:\n\n          \u201cIf multiple parties or multiple claims for relief are involved in an action, an\n          appeal may be taken from a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all\n          of the parties or claims only if the trial court has made an express written finding\n          that there is no just reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both.\n          *** In the absence of such a finding, any judgment that adjudicates fewer than\n          all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties is not\n          enforceable or appealable and is subject to revision at any time before the entry\n          of a judgment adjudicating all the claims, rights, and liabilities of all the\n          parties.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       The construction of Illinois Supreme Court rules is a question of law subject to\n       de novo review. People v. English, 2023 IL 128077, \u00b6 13. We interpret our rules in\n       the same manner as statutes, with the primary concern being to give effect to our\n       intent, most commonly shown through the rule\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. Id.\n       Likewise, we review de novo the issue of whether a court has jurisdiction. In re\n       Marriage of Crecos, 2021 IL 126192, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b6 21        Rule 304(a) supplanted former section 50(2) of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev.\n       Stat. 1957, ch. 110, \u00b6 50(2)). In re Marriage of Lentz, 79 Ill. 2d 400, 407 (1980).\n       We have described section 50(2) as \u201cnot one which either curtails or grants\n       appellate jurisdiction, but *** one which fixes the procedure in the trial court as to\n       the conditions affecting the terms upon which an appeal may be taken in advance\n       of a determination of the entire case.\u201d Ariola v. Nigro, 13 Ill. 2d 200, 207 (1958).\n       Prior to section 50(2), a wider scope of judgments was immediately appealable. See\n       Barnhart v. Barnhart, 415 Ill. 303, 309 (1953) (\u201cA decree is final [and appealable]\n       if it determines the ultimate rights of the parties with respect to distinct matters\n       which have no bearing on other matters left for further consideration or if the\n       matters left for future determination are merely incidental to the ultimate rights\n       which have been adjudicated by the decree.\u201d). A judgment was traditionally defined\n       as the court\u2019s determination on the issues presented by the pleadings, which\n       ascertained and fixed absolutely and finally the rights of the parties to the lawsuit.\n       Towns v. Yellow Cab Co., 73 Ill. 2d 113, 119 (1978). \u201cBecause judgments are final\n       in nature, the rule developed that judgments as to fewer than all parties or claims\n       were not only appealable, but had to be appealed if the rights of the party against\n       whom the judgment had been entered were to be preserved.\u201d Id. This led to\n       \u201cundesirable fragmentary appeals.\u201d Id. The legislature therefore enacted section\n       50(2) to discourage piecemeal appeals and to remove uncertainty about\n       appealability when a final judgment was entered on fewer than all matters of\n       controversy. Carter v. Chicago & Illinois Midland Ry. Co., 119 Ill. 2d 296 (1988);\n       Ariola, 13 Ill. 2d at 207.\n\n\u00b6 22       As stated, Rule 304(a) has since replaced section 50(2). To be considered final\n       for Rule 304(a) purposes, the order must dispose of the rights of the parties, either\n       upon the entire controversy or upon some definite and separate part thereof.\n       Johnson, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 21. \u201c[I]t is not the court\u2019s finding that makes the\n       judgment final, but it is the court\u2019s finding that makes this kind of a final judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       appealable.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a), Committee Comments (rev. Sept. 1988); see also\n       Johnson, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 20 (Rule 304(a) language cannot confer appellate\n       jurisdiction for a nonfinal order). Like section 50(2), the policy considerations\n       underlying Rule 304(a) include \u201c \u2018discouraging piecemeal appeals in the absence\n       of some compelling reason and *** removing the uncertainty as to the appealability\n       of a judgment which was entered on less than all of the matters in controversy.\u2019 \u201d\n       The Carle Foundation v. Cunningham Township, 2017 IL 120427, \u00b6 15 (quoting\n       In re Marriage of Lentz, 79 Ill. 2d at 407). In other words, \u201ca Rule 304(a) appeal is\n       an exception to the general policy disfavoring piecemeal appeals.\u201d Elg v.\n       Whittington, 119 Ill. 2d 344, 354 (1987).\n\n\u00b6 23       We note that in the instant case the circuit court entered a Rule 304(a) finding\n       on the portion of the litigation that dismissed petitioner\u2019s separate claims as to\n       defendants, giving the appellate court jurisdiction to review that order. The\n       substitution of judge rulings would not have been subject to their own Rule 304(a)\n       findings for appeal because they were not \u201cfinal\u201d in that they did not dispose of the\n       parties\u2019 rights as to a separate part of the controversy. See Johnson, 2022 IL\n       127942, \u00b6 21; People ex rel. Scott v. Silverstein, 87 Ill. 2d 167, 171 (1981)\n       (\u201cPreliminary orders in a pending case are not appealable because they are\n       reviewable on appeal from the final order.\u201d). The question here is whether the\n       appellate court has jurisdiction over such a ruling in an appeal of the subsequent\n       order under Rule 304(a).\n\n\u00b6 24        The appellate court has issued conflicting opinions regarding whether it has\n       jurisdiction over rulings on requests for substitution of judge in conjunction with\n       an appealable interlocutory order. Petitioner relies primarily on Berlin, 268 Ill. App.\n       3d at 186-87. There, the Fourth District held that, in an interlocutory appeal of a\n       grant of a preliminary injunction under Rule 307(a)(1), it had jurisdiction over a\n       ruling on a motion for substitution of judge as a matter of right. Id. The appellate\n       court stated that the \u201cscope of the review under Rule 307 is to review any prior\n       error that bears directly upon the question of whether the order on appeal was\n       proper,\u201d which included \u201cwhether the judge hearing the request for interlocutory\n       injunctive relief should have been sitting in that matter.\u201d Id. at 187. According to\n       the court, a contrary holding would allow \u201ca judge who should not be hearing a\n       motion for interlocutory injunctive relief to hear that matter without the objecting\n       party having any recourse.\u201d Id. at 186-87. The Appellate Court, First District, has\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       followed Berlin. See Bank of America, N.A. v. Freed, 2012 IL App (1st) 110749,\n       \u00b6\u00b6 14-16 (the defendants forfeited the issue of whether the circuit court erred in\n       refusing to grant their motion for substitution of judge as a matter of right because\n       they did not raise the issue in their prior interlocutory appeal); Partipilo v. Partipilo,\n       331 Ill. App. 3d 394, 398 (1st Dist. 2002) (citing Berlin without additional\n       analysis); see also In re A.N., 324 Ill. App. 3d 510, 512 (4th Dist. 2001) (applying\n       Berlin\u2019s rationale to the State\u2019s appeal under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1)\n       (eff. Nov. 1, 2000)).\n\n\u00b6 25       Respondent and the Morgan Stanley defendants cite In re Marriage of\n       Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d 961, in which the Appellate Court, Second District,\n       reached a different result. In that case, the husband appealed under Illinois Supreme\n       Court Rule 304(b)(5) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994) from an order of indirect civil contempt,\n       and he also sought review of his motions for substitution of judge. In re Marriage\n       of Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d at 962. The court stated that, pursuant to Rule\n       304(b)(5)\u2019s plain meaning, the only order subject to review was the circuit court\u2019s\n       finding of contempt, which necessarily required a review of the temporary\n       maintenance with which the husband had refused to comply. Id. at 968. In contrast,\n       the rulings on the motions for substitution were interlocutory and reviewable only\n       on appeal from the final order. Id. at 969.\n\n\u00b6 26       The In re Marriage of Nettleton court stated that Berlin was distinguishable\n       because there the court reviewed uncontroverted facts to determine whether the\n       motion for substitution was timely filed before a substantive issue had been ruled\n       upon, whereas in the case before it, the facts were controverted. Id. at 970. Even\n       otherwise, it \u201cbelieved[d] that the supreme court rule should prevail over the ruling\n       of Berlin, such that [it was] precluded from reviewing the merits of the rulings on\n       the motions.\u201d Id. The court stated that a contrary interpretation would allow a party\n       to circumvent supreme court rules by obtaining an appeal by refusing to comply\n       with an order and being found in contempt, at which time the party could appeal\n       the contempt order as a means to \u201cchallenge all other orders with which the party\n       is dissatisfied.\u201d Id. at 971. The Appellate Court, Third District, has followed In re\n       Marriage of Nettleton. See In re Marriage of Morgan, 2019 IL App (3d) 180560,\n       \u00b6 14; see also U.S. Bank National Ass\u2019n v. IN Retail Fund Algonquin Commons,\n       LLC, 2013 IL App (2d) 130213 (concluding that in an appeal under Rule 307(a)(1)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       the court lacked jurisdiction over an order granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for\n       substitution of judge as a matter of right).\n\n\u00b6 27        Petitioner additionally cites In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien, 2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 23,\n       and Burtell v. First Charter Service Corp., 76 Ill. 2d 427, 435 (1979), for the\n       proposition that appellate review includes not only the order specifically appealed\n       but also all orders in the procedural progression of that order. In re Marriage of\n       O\u2019Brien was before this court on an application for a certificate of importance under\n       Illinois Supreme Court Rule 316 (eff. Dec. 6, 2006), after a judgment of dissolution\n       had been entered. The wife argued that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction over\n       an order denying substitution for cause, because the husband\u2019s notice of appeal did\n       not specify that he was appealing that particular order. In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien,\n       2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 21. We stated that notices of appeal are to be liberally construed\n       and that they \u201cconfer jurisdiction even if the order was not expressly mentioned in\n       the notice of appeal, if that order was \u2018a \u201cstep in the procedural progression\n       leading\u201d \u2019 to the judgment which was specified in the notice of appeal.\u201d Id. \u00b6 23\n       (quoting Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 435, quoting Elfman Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp.,\n       567 F.2d 1252, 1254 (3d Cir. 1977)). We stated that, because the denial of the\n       husband\u2019s petition to substitute was a step in the procedural progression leading to\n       the final judgment specified in his notice of appeal, the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction to review the order. Id.\n\n\u00b6 28       The issue in Burtell was also the construction of a notice of appeal on review\n       from the final judgment of the case. The notice of appeal listed the final money\n       judgment, but not a prior order in which the circuit court found that a joint venture\n       existed and ordered an accounting. Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 431-32. We stated:\n\n          \u201cWhen an appeal is taken from a specified judgment only, or from a part of a\n          specified judgment, the court of review acquires no jurisdiction to review other\n          judgments or parts thereof not so specified or not fairly to be inferred from the\n          notice as intended to be presented for review on the appeal. If from the notice\n          of appeal itself and the subsequent proceedings it appears that the appeal was\n          intended, and the appellant and the appellee so understood, to have been taken\n          from an unspecified judgment or part thereof, the notice of appeal may be\n          construed as bringing up for review the unspecified part of the order or\n          judgment. Such a construction would be appropriate where the specified order\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f          directly relates back to the judgment or order sought to be reviewed.\n          Paraphrasing the language of Elfman, the unspecified judgment is reviewable if\n          it is a \u2018step in the procedural progression leading\u2019 to the judgment specified in\n          the notice of appeal.\u201d Id. at 434 (quoting Elfman Motors, 567 F.2d at 1254).\n\n       We stated that the order finding the existence of a joint venture was a preliminary\n       determination necessary to the ultimate relief that plaintiff sought, namely a money\n       judgment based on an accounting. Thus, \u201cit was sufficiently closely related\u201d to the\n       money judgment specified in the notice of appeal that the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction to consider the order. Id. at 436.\n\n\u00b6 29        We conclude that the appellate court here was correct in its determination that\n       Rule 304(a) did not confer jurisdiction to review the rulings on the petition and\n       motion for substitution of judge. In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien and Burtell are\n       distinguishable from this situation because they involved the construction of a\n       notice of appeal in an appeal from the final judgment in the case. Interlocutory\n       orders that are not immediately appealable are subject to review upon appeal from\n       the final judgment in the case. See id. at 433 (the appeal from a final judgment\n       \u201c \u2018draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the\n       judgment\u2019 \u201d (quoting Elfman Motors, 567 F.2d at 1253)). Therefore, the\n       substitution of judge order in In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien was appealable when the\n       final judgment in the case was entered. Typically, a \u201cnotice of appeal confers\n       jurisdiction on a court of review to consider only the judgments or parts of\n       judgments specified in the notice of appeal\u201d (General Motors Corp. v. Pappas, 242\n       Ill. 2d 163, 176 (2011)), but although the substitution of judge order was not listed\n       in the In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien notice of appeal, we liberally construed the notice\n       of appeal to include that order as \u201c \u2018a \u201cstep in the procedural progression leading\u201d \u2019\n       to the judgment which was specified in the notice of appeal\u201d (In re Marriage of\n       O\u2019Brien, 2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 23 (quoting Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 435, quoting Elfman\n       Motors, 567 F.2d at 1254)). Again, there was no question that the substitution of\n       judge ruling was appealable at that time because a final judgment had been entered\n       in the case, and the controversy was only in construing the notice of appeal to\n       determine whether the appellant sufficiently invoked review of the order.\n\n\u00b6 30      Here, the dispute is focused not on the scope of the notice of appeal but rather\n       on the broader question of whether Rule 304(a) could give the appellate court\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f       jurisdiction to review the substitution of judge rulings. Rule 304(a) applies\n       exclusively to final orders. Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). In an\n       interlocutory appeal under Rule 304(a), the circuit court has determined that, in\n       spite of the court\u2019s general policy disfavoring fragmented appeals, \u201cthere is no just\n       reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both\u201d of a particular \u201cfinal\n       judgment.\u201d Id. In this manner, a Rule 304(a) appeal is limited in scope and does not\n       pave the way for review of all prior orders. See also Trent v. Winningham, 172 Ill.\n       2d 420, 424 (1996) (the intended scope of review under Rule 304(a) is tailored to\n       particular issues). The circuit court in the instant case entered Rule 304(a) findings\n       on the order dismissing petitioner\u2019s complaint against the Stogsdill and Morgan\n       Stanley defendants and the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider, such that the\n       extent of the appellate court\u2019s review was restricted to determining whether the\n       dismissal was in error. Cf. Postma v. Jack Brown Buick Inc., 157 Ill. 2d 391, 399\n       (1993) (in an appeal under Rule 307(a)(1), the only question properly before the\n       court is whether there was a sufficient showing made in the circuit court to sustain\n       its order granting or denying interlocutory relief); People v. Ernest, 141 Ill. 2d 412,\n       424 (1990) (stating, in an attorney\u2019s appeal from a finding of direct criminal\n       contempt, that the propriety of an order denying a motion for substitution of judge\n       was not before the court and that a \u201ccourt order made within the proper exercise of\n       jurisdiction, no matter how erroneous, must be obeyed until the order is modified\n       or set aside by the trial court or reversed on appeal\u201d). Accordingly, even if petitioner\n       had expressly listed the substitution of judge rulings in his notice of appeal along\n       with the orders specified in the Rule 304(a) findings, Rule 304(a) would not give\n       the appellate court jurisdiction to review the rulings on the substitution requests.\n\n\u00b6 31       One could argue that review of certain orders appealed under Rule 304(a) could\n       require review of prior rulings in order to address the merits of the particular order\n       appealed. See IN Retail Fund Algonquin Commons, LLC, 2013 IL App (2d)\n       130213, \u00b6 22 (\u201c[R]eview of an interlocutory order may well require review of\n       \u2018attendant\u2019 prior orders, i.e., those intertwined with the merits of the interlocutory\n       order.\u201d). Rulings on petitions and motions for substitution of judge do not fall into\n       this category, as they are independent of the substantive merits of the order at issue\n       in a Rule 304(a) appeal. Whether a substitution request should have been granted\n       is not intertwined with the merits of the final judgment subject to Rule 304(a)\n       review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f\u00b6 32       It is true, as petitioner highlights, that all orders entered after an erroneous\n       denial of substitution are a nullity and must be vacated. Palos Community Hospital\n       v. Humana Insurance Co., 2021 IL 126008, \u00b6 34. Petitioner argues that, by\n       considering the denial of a petition for substitution of judge during an interlocutory\n       appeal, we would be promoting the efficient use of judicial and party resources\n       during the proceedings. Respondent counters that, if we allow jurisdiction, it could\n       open the floodgates to appellate challenges by parties who seek to upend the\n       progress of their cases, as they could file pretextual requests for injunctions and\n       then obtain appeals to also challenge the rulings on the substitution motions.\n\n\u00b6 33       We note that this marriage dissolution case has been litigated for more than 10\n       years even without a reversal of a substitution of judge ruling, which suggests that\n       considerations of judicial economy and the preservation of party resources have not\n       been top of mind. More significantly, \u201c[p]rinciples of judicial economy may not\n       trump the jurisdictional barrier erected by\u201d an Illinois Supreme Court rule. People\n       v. Johnson, 208 Ill. 2d 118, 141 (2003)). There is no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       that independently allows for an appeal from an interlocutory order resolving a\n       petition or motion for substitution of judge. Rule 304(a) provides for review of just\n       the intermediate final judgment that the circuit court has allowed the party to appeal\n       from, along with any previous orders that must necessarily be reviewed because\n       they are intertwined with the merits of the judgment with the Rule 304(a) finding;\n       Rule 304(a) does not provide jurisdiction to review rulings on requests for\n       substitution of judge. 2\n\n\n\u00b6 34                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 35       For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court dismissing\n       the portion of petitioner\u2019s appeal pertaining to the rulings on his petition and motion\n       for substitution of judge.\n\n\n\n\n           2\n             As the issue before us pertains to an appeal under Rule 304(a), we do not resolve whether\n       rulings on requests for substitution of judge could be reviewed in conjunction with other types of\n       interlocutory appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 36   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                   - 13 -\n\f","                                      2024 IL 129133\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 129133)\n\n               THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Appellee, v.\n                      MICHEAL D. CHATMAN, Appellant.\n\n\n                              Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n        JUSTICE HOLDER WHITE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n\n        Chief Justice Theis and Justices Neville, Overstreet, Cunningham, Rochford,\n     and O\u2019Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\u00b61       In January 2020, the State charged defendant, Micheal D. Chatman, with four\n     counts of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5\/9-1(a)(1)-(3) (West 2018)) in connection\n     with the shooting death of Ricky Green. Prior to trial, the State sought to introduce\n     statements made by Dominique \u201cDee\u201d Collins, who was unable to be located, under\n     the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule (Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5)\n\f     (eff. Jan. 1, 2011)) and the sixth amendment confrontation clause (U.S. Const.,\n     amend. VI). The Champaign County circuit court allowed Collins\u2019s statements to\n     be introduced, finding him unavailable and that the State had made reasonable,\n     good-faith efforts to secure his presence at trial. A jury found defendant guilty of\n     felony murder, and the court sentenced him to prison. The appellate court affirmed.\n     2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b62       Now on appeal, defendant argues the State was required to demonstrate good-\n     faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s presence at trial but failed to do so. We affirm.\n\n\n\u00b63                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64        Not long after midnight on March 23, 2018, Ricky Green was shot twice and\n     killed in Champaign. Shortly before his death, Green was in a car with defendant,\n     codefendant Michael Simmons, and Kotia Fairman. After police officers followed\n     their car, Green, defendant, and Simmons ran because they had guns and drugs in\n     the car. While they fled, an altercation ensued between Green and defendant, during\n     which defendant shot Green. Items tied to defendant and Simmons were later found\n     in the car, including a .357 Magnum revolver, which was not used to shoot Green.\n\n\u00b65        Based on this incident, the State charged defendant with unlawful possession of\n     a firearm by a felon and obstruction of justice. In August 2018, defendant pleaded\n     guilty and received a sentence of probation. The State did not charge him with\n     Green\u2019s murder until January 2020. This occurred after the State on December 30,\n     2019, secured a video-recorded statement from Dee Collins, wherein he related to\n     Detective Jeremiah Christian that defendant had confessed to Collins shortly after\n     the shooting.\n\n\u00b66        In October 2020, the State filed a motion in limine to admit Collins\u2019s statements\n     due to forfeiture by wrongdoing. The motion alleged Collins was interviewed on\n     December 30, 2019, after his arrest on a traffic warrant. Collins said he had been\n     with defendant the morning after the shooting when defendant bragged about\n     killing Green. Defendant told Collins that he, Simmons, and Green were in the back\n     seat of a vehicle and defendant had planned to rob Green of a gun. As they fled\n     from the police, defendant grabbed Green\u2019s gun. When Green later tried to retrieve\n     it, defendant feared for his safety and shot Green.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f\u00b67       The motion claimed defendant talked in recorded jailhouse phone calls about\n     Collins speaking to the police and making sure he did not testify. Although\n     defendant did not give specific orders during the calls to prevent Collins from\n     testifying, defendant\u2019s father and brother indicated they would ensure Collins\n     would not cooperate with the police or appear at trial. On February 16, 2020,\n     Collins sent an officer a text message that read, \u201cEverybody think I told on Mikey\n     [(Defendant)] idk how they getting this information I\u2019ve been getting threats from\n     a lot of people.\u201d Collins fled to Iowa. On March 12, 2020, Collins met with a\n     detective in Iowa and stated he had been receiving threatening text messages and\n     social media posts from people associated with defendant and Simmons. The\n     motion claimed Collins had moved out of state because he feared for his life. On\n     October 9, 2020, Detective Christian sent a text message to Collins\u2019s phone\n     number. Collins initially did not respond, but a later response said Christian had the\n     wrong number.\n\n\u00b68       In February 2021, the circuit court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motion. The\n     State introduced defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls pertaining to Collins and\n     Collins\u2019s December 2019 video-recorded statement. Following arguments, the\n     court found the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\n     intended by his actions to prevent Collins, a material witness, from testifying. The\n     court reserved the issue of whether the State had made reasonable efforts to secure\n     Collins\u2019s presence for a later hearing.\n\n\u00b69       That hearing took place on May 6, 2021, and Detective Christian testified\n     regarding his efforts to locate Collins. He tried locating Collins on February 16,\n     2021, through a posting on \u201cI-Board,\u201d an intelligence-based software program that\n     disseminates information locally to various law-enforcement agencies and all\n     officers. He reposted it on April 28 and May 5. Christian indicated the postings had\n     been viewed 119 times without a response. He noted Collins had not been listed as\n     a missing person in LEADS 1 or on any list with the Federal Bureau of\n     Investigation.\n\n\n\n\n         1 LEADS is Illinois\u2019s Law Enforcement Agencies Data System. See, e.g., 20 ILCS 2605\/2605-\n\n     375 (West 2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f\u00b6 10       Prior to the reasonable efforts hearing, Christian had traveled to Iowa to meet\n       with Collins. He later communicated with law enforcement in Davenport, Iowa, in\n       hopes of finding him. Christian testified he served a subpoena in Aurora on\n       Demetria Chatman, defendant\u2019s mother, who was also related to Collins, but denied\n       any contact with Collins. In listening to defendant\u2019s jailhouse calls, Christian\n       indicated defendant told a third party that he and his counsel had been unable to\n       contact Collins. Christian stated he had received information that Collins was in\n       Indianapolis \u201cfor a show\u201d but provided no other details.\n\n\u00b6 11      Following the testimony, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n             \u201cWe\u2019re looking under Illinois Rules of Evidence number 804 that indicates\n          a witness is unavailable if the proponent of the statement has been unable to\n          procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means.\n\n               So the real question here is whether or not the State has made good faith\n          efforts to present Mr. Collins as a witness at trial here. Is there something\n          somebody could always do more? I suppose there is. I suppose the deputy\u2014the\n          officer could have gone back to Davenport recently, but he went there once.\n          There is no such thing as a national database. He\u2019s really not a missing person.\n          I think he could best be described as Officer Christian indicated, he\u2019s somebody\n          who didn\u2019t want to be found.\n\n              I\u2019m not sure how effective putting it on this board was when it was really\n          just local, but he did contact law enforcement in the Davenport, Iowa, area, and\n          they hadn\u2019t had any contact with him in a number of years. I don\u2019t know who\n          he spoke to, but the witness did indicate that everybody he had spoken to,\n          nobody knew the whereabouts. And although it doesn\u2019t\u2014at first blush, it\n          sounded like attorney-client information, Ms. Alferink [(assistant state\u2019s\n          attorney)] clarified that it appeared that Mr. Chatman made some statements to\n          other individuals indicating that he believes that Mr. Collins is\u2014cannot be\n          found even by the defense. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. But the real\n          question is whether or not the State has used good faith efforts and used\n          reasonable means and effort. And based on the totality of the circumstances\n          here, the Court is going to make that finding. And, therefore, the Court is going\n          to show that the State has tried to get Mr. Collins\u2019 attendance by process or\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f          other reasonable means. They\u2019ve used good faith effort. They\u2019ve been unable\n          to do so. And, therefore, the statements will be admissible.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 12       Prior to the start of defendant\u2019s trial in September 2021, the circuit court held a\n       second hearing on the State\u2019s efforts to locate Collins. Detective Christian testified\n       that the I-Board posting regarding Collins had been viewed more than 250 times\n       since the last posting. In August 2021, Christian researched various databases in\n       search of a recent address for Collins. He and another police detective went to an\n       address of an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but there appeared\n       to be no one inside. They also went to a house on Springfield Avenue in Champaign\n       that Collins had used in 2018, but Christian said the house appeared to be vacant\n       and no one answered the door. Christian stated he went to the residence of Collins\u2019s\n       brother, Devonte McCormick, on Dale Drive in Champaign but, although there\n       were vehicles in the driveway and Christian suspected people were inside, no one\n       answered the door.\n\n\u00b6 13       Christian stated he traveled out of state to a home linked to Collins but there\n       was no one inside, and Christian had no reason to think Collins lived there any\n       longer. Christian also stated he and a detective traveled to Kendall County to check\n       two addresses linked to Collins, but they received no answer at either location.\n\n\u00b6 14       On cross-examination, Christian testified no warrants had been issued for\n       Collins and no request had been put into LEADS to find him. The last time\n       Christian dialed Collins\u2019s phone number, he heard a voice he did not recognize, and\n       the man said he had the wrong number.\n\n\u00b6 15      Following arguments, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n          \u201cWell, the Court has already found that there was forfeiture by wrongdoing.\n          The issue now is whether or not the State has made reasonable efforts to show\n          that Mr. Collins is unavailable. I did find that back in May. And now I\u2019ve heard\n          more testimony about what efforts have been made since this time. And Mr.\n          Nolan [(defense counsel)] argues that it was a half-hearted attempt that they\n          knocked on a door and heard some noise and left, and that\u2019s true. But most of\n          the other arguments that Mr. Nolan makes really are not persuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f              In terms of putting someone into LEADS for statewide. I heard the\n          testimony that you would need a warrant, and there\u2019s no warrant, and so it\n          would not be allowed into LEADS. He\u2019s *** unaware of the database for the\n          FBI and how that has to be done. And, in fact, Ms. Alferink just indicated here\n          that although she did get a warrant for several other witnesses, that\u2019s because\n          they had been served with a subpoena and Mr. Collins had not.\n\n              What I did hear is that there has been continued effort to put this person on\n          the iBoard, which of course is more locally centralized. But if you have\n          detectives in our area working on other cases, they may hear nuggets about Mr.\n          Collins, so it is a useful tool, although it is somewhat local. But he did go to a\n          number of addresses. He called some numbers. He went out of state.\n\n              He has made in my opinion reasonable efforts. Not perfect efforts. Not all\n          the efforts that could possibly be made, but reasonable efforts. And the State\n          simply has to show this that the witness is unavailable by preponderance of the\n          evidence, which I certainly do find at this time.\n\n             Therefore, the Court is going to find reasonable efforts to locate Mr. Collins\n          have failed. He is unavailable. The statements will come in pursuant to the\n          Court\u2019s previous order.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16       The case then proceeded to a jury trial. As the appellate court laid out the\n       testimony and evidence in its opinion, we will summarize only those facts necessary\n       to fully analyze the issues on appeal. The trial testimony established that, on the\n       afternoon before Green\u2019s murder, defendant and Simmons planned to steal Green\u2019s\n       gun. In the evening, defendant sent Facebook messages to Green inviting him to\n       get together with him and Simmons. The three went to a party before leaving and\n       picking up Kotia Fairman.\n\n\u00b6 17        Defendant later heard from his mother, who asked them to pick her up at a\n       trailer park. Upon arrival, they saw police in the area, so they parked near the\n       entrance. Earlier, Calvin Wilson, who was dating defendant\u2019s mother, had told\n       police about a domestic dispute they had that evening. Wilson told police that\n       defendant might have information and described the car he was in.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\f\u00b6 18      Shortly after midnight, police officers saw a car that matched Wilson\u2019s\n       description of the one in which defendant had been riding. When officers\n       approached, the driver of the car drove off. The officers eventually found the car\n       parked in the middle of the street. Fairman was walking around the car, but\n       defendant, Green, and Simmons were no longer there. Inside the car, officers found\n       Simmons\u2019s identification, defendant\u2019s cell phone, and a .357 Magnum revolver.\n\n\u00b6 19       As officers approached the vehicle, they heard yelling and gunshots in the\n       distance. Another officer responded to a call of shots fired and discovered Green\n       lying in the street. Green, who had been shot in his groin and shoulder, later died at\n       the hospital. A brown left boot was found near Green\u2019s body, and a brown right\n       boot was found under a nearby parked car. Forensic testing determined that DNA\n       on the left boot was consistent with defendant\u2019s DNA profile.\n\n\u00b6 20      In the early morning hours, defendant knocked on the door of Alexandrinique\n       Anderson and asked to use her phone. Defendant was barefoot at the time and told\n       her he had come from the trailer park where he had been attacked by \u201csome\n       Mexicans\u201d and had to defend himself.\n\n\u00b6 21       The video recording of Collins\u2019s statement to the police was played for the jury.\n       Collins said that, on the morning after Green\u2019s murder, defendant arrived at\n       Collins\u2019s brother\u2019s home without any socks or shoes. Defendant told Collins that\n       he tried to take Green\u2019s gun and run but Green chased him, so defendant turned\n       around and shot him twice. Defendant then ran away.\n\n\u00b6 22       Police interviewed defendant two days after the murder and again in October\n       2019. During both interviews, he denied shooting Green. He said he jumped out of\n       the car to run from police, heard shots, ran faster, and lost his shoes. The State\u2019s\n       evidence included incriminating statements defendant made during his jailhouse\n       phone calls while he was in custody on the gun possession charge and later on the\n       murder charge.\n\n\u00b6 23       Defendant also confessed to Dennis Griham while they were housed in the same\n       cellblock of the county jail in February 2020. Griham, who was in prison at the time\n       of defendant\u2019s trial, testified defendant stated he and Simmons had called Green\n       and told him they \u201chad a lick, which meant something had come up.\u201d They picked\n       up Green, \u201crolled around for a little while,\u201d and wound up at a trailer park.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       Defendant told Griham he \u201ctussl[ed]\u201d with Green for the gun and defendant\n       \u201caccidentally shot Mr. Green in the chest twice.\u201d Defendant stated he ran, lost one\n       of his boots, and hid.\n\n\u00b6 24       Defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed the text messages between\n       him and Simmons were not about robbing Green. Instead, he, Simmons, and Green\n       planned to steal guns from Green\u2019s friends. When the police attempted to stop their\n       vehicle, the men \u201cstarted tucking guns under the seat.\u201d When their car stopped,\n       defendant grabbed a gun and ran. After defendant and Green stopped running,\n       Green asked for his gun. Defendant wanted to get away from the police first, but\n       Green \u201cgot aggressive.\u201d Green grabbed him, and defendant tried to get away. When\n       Green continued to grab defendant and put a hand on his shoulder, defendant tried\n       to run and then shot him. With Green still on him, defendant fired again. Defendant\n       then ran and hid under a car.\n\n\u00b6 25        Defendant stated he never went to Devonte McCormick\u2019s house and never saw\n       Collins on the morning after the shooting. Defendant also testified that Griham\n       asked a lot of questions about his case but twisted his words and \u201cmade up his own\n       little story.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26       The jury found defendant guilty of felony murder. 720 ILCS 5\/9-1(a)(3) (West\n       2018). Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for acquittal or, in the alternative, for a\n       new trial, arguing inter alia that the State did not meet its burden of proving\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing to admit Collins\u2019s statement. The circuit court denied the\n       motion and sentenced defendant to 55 years in prison.\n\n\u00b6 27       Defendant appealed, arguing the circuit court erred in finding the State made\n       reasonable, good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial. 2022 IL App\n       (4th) 210716, \u00b6 46. Initially, the Fourth District agreed with defendant that the State\n       is required, in the context of Rule 804(a)(5) (Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1,\n       2011)), to show that reasonable, good-faith efforts were made to procure a witness\u2019s\n       attendance. 2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 54. The appellate court went on, however,\n       to find the State\u2019s efforts to locate Collins were reasonable and thus the circuit\n       court\u2019s similar finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. \u00b6 64.\n       The Fourth District affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. Id. \u00b6 73.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f\u00b6 28       In November 2022, defendant petitioned this court for leave to appeal, and we\n       allowed that petition. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 29                                      ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 30       Defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues this court should adopt\n       the Fourth District\u2019s holding that, when seeking to introduce hearsay statements\n       under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception, the State must demonstrate its good-\n       faith efforts to procure a witness\u2019s attendance where the witness is allegedly\n       unavailable due to the opposing party\u2019s wrongdoing. Second, he argues the State\n       failed to show good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s presence at trial. Third, he\n       argues the circuit court\u2019s error in admitting Collins\u2019s statement violated his\n       constitutional right to confront a witness against him and that the error was not\n       harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\u00b6 31                              I. Forfeiture by Wrongdoing\n\n\u00b6 32      The common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing serves both as an\n       exception to the hearsay rule and to the confrontation clause of the sixth\n       amendment. People v. Hanson, 238 Ill. 2d 74, 96-97 (2010); Crawford v.\n       Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 62 (2004). The doctrine is codified in Illinois Rule of\n       Evidence 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) and Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6).\n       People v. Peterson, 2017 IL 120331, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n\u00b6 33       Ordinarily, the rule against hearsay would prohibit the introduction at trial of\n       out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Id. \u00b6 17.\n       However, the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception in Rule 804(b)(5) provides that\n       \u201c[a] statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing\n       that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a\n       witness\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1,\n       2011).\n\n\u00b6 34       As the proponent of the hearsay here, the State had the burden of proving by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that defendant engaged in wrongdoing that was\n       intended to, and did, procure Collins\u2019s unavailability. Peterson, 2017 IL 120331,\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f       \u00b6 39. Where the circuit court makes a finding by a preponderance of the evidence,\n       that finding will only be reversed if it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n       Id. \u201cA finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence where \u2018the opposite\n       conclusion is clearly evident or if the finding itself is unreasonable, arbitrary, or not\n       based on the evidence presented.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting People v. Deleon, 227 Ill. 2d 322,\n       332 (2008)).\n\n\u00b6 35       In this case, defendant does not challenge the circuit court\u2019s finding that he\n       engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing to prevent Collins from testifying. Instead,\n       his arguments center on Collins\u2019s unavailability and his belief that the State was\n       required to demonstrate good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial.\n\n\u00b6 36       For the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to apply, the declarant must be\n       unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a) defines\n       \u201cunavailability as a witness\u201d and lists five situations in which a witness may be\n       found to be unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Here, only one\n       scenario applies\u2014where the declarant \u201cis absent from the hearing and the\n       proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance ***\n       by process or other reasonable means.\u201d Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011).\n\n\u00b6 37       Illinois Rule of Evidence 804 is modeled after Federal Rule of Evidence 804,\n       and this court may look to federal law as guidance in determining the State\u2019s\n       obligations in seeking to introduce the statements of an unavailable witness. See\n       People v. Thompson, 2016 IL 118667, \u00b6 40. In analyzing an exception to the\n       confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court has stated a declarant is not\n       unavailable \u201c \u2018unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to\n       obtain his presence at trial.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56,\n       74 (1980) (quoting Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725 (1968)).\n\n\u00b6 38       In the appellate court, the State relied on People v. Golden, 2021 IL App (2d)\n       200207, in arguing the prosecutor need not make good-faith efforts to secure a\n       witness\u2019s testimony if the statements are being admitted under Rule 804(b)(5). In\n       Golden, the defendant had argued Rule 804(b)(5) included the requirement under\n       Rule 804(a)(5) \u201cthat the proponent of the hearsay statement demonstrate an\n       inability to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable\n       means.\u201d Id. \u00b6 70. The Second District disagreed and stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f              \u201cRule 804 governs exceptions to the rule against hearsay where the\n          declarant is unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a)(5)\n          expressly encompasses situations in which the declarant \u2018is absent from the\n          hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the\n          declarant\u2019s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision\n          (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony) by process or other\n          reasonable means.\u2019 Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). By its very terms,\n          then, Rule 804(a)(5) does not apply to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing\n          as codified in Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. \u00b6 71.\n\n\u00b6 39       In support of its conclusion, the Second District went on to cite this court\u2019s\n       decision in Peterson, which stated Rule 804(b)(5) \u201c \u2018identifies only two criteria or\n       factors that must be satisfied for the admission of hearsay statements under the\n       rule:\u2019 wrongdoing on the part of the defendant and evidence that the wrongdoing\n       was committed with the intent to, and did, render the witness unavailable to testify.\u201d\n       Id. \u00b6 72 (quoting Peterson, 2017 IL 120331, \u00b6 32). The court also cited People v.\n       Zimmerman, 2018 IL App (4th) 170695, \u00b6 98, which found Rule 804(b)(5) only has\n       those same two factors that must be satisfied. Golden, 2021 IL App (2d) 200207,\n       \u00b6 72. The Second District believed this interpretation of Rule 804(b)(5) \u201cdoes not\n       require the State to demonstrate in any particular manner that the witness was\n       unavailable despite its best efforts to procure the witness\u2019s attendance.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 40       The Fourth District in this case disagreed with Golden as it related to the plain\n       language of Rule 804(a)(5). 2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 51. In looking at Rule\n       804(a), the appellate court stated \u201csubdivision (a)(5) applies to subdivisions (b)(1)\n       and (5) when the declarant\u2019s attendance cannot be procured and to subdivisions\n       (b)(2), (3), and (4) when either the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony cannot be\n       procured\u201d as those subdivisions apply to dying declarations, statements against\n       interest, and statements of personal or family history. Id. \u00b6 51 & n.2. Thus, the court\n       concluded Rule 804(a)(5) applied to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing. Id.\n       \u00b6 51.\n\n\u00b6 41        The Fourth District also rejected Golden\u2019s reliance on Peterson and\n       Zimmerman, stating neither addressed the interaction between subdivisions (a)(5)\n       and (b)(5) of Rule 804. Id. \u00b6 52. \u201cPeterson addressed whether additional indicia of\n       reliability were required to introduce a hearsay statement where the defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f       procured the declarant\u2019s unavailability by killing them and Zimmerman addressed\n       what types of statements were admissible under Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. The Fourth\n       District held that, \u201cbecause a witness must be unavailable as a prerequisite to\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing, it falls on the proponent of the statement to demonstrate\n       unavailability by a preponderance of the evidence in some manner under Rule\n       804(a).\u201d Id. \u00b6 53.\n\n\u00b6 42       As the State contended Collins could not be located and thus could not be served\n       or otherwise compelled to come to court, the Fourth District found it fell \u201cwithin\n       the purview of Rule 804(a)(5) and require[d] the State to show that good-faith\n       reasonable efforts were made to procure the witnesses\u2019 attendance by a\n       preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Id. \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 43       We note the State here has abandoned any reliance on Golden and does not cite\n       the opinion in its brief to this court. Even if it did, on the issue of the State\u2019s\n       obligations under Rule 804(a)(5) and (b)(5), we find the Fourth District\u2019s reasoning\n       is correct. The plain language of Rule 804(b)(5) requires the unavailability of a\n       witness, and Rule 804(a) defines unavailability. When considering a witness\u2019s\n       unavailability in the confrontation clause context, this court has required the State\n       to \u201c \u2018either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose\n       statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d People v. Torres, 2012 IL\n       111302, \u00b6 54 (quoting People v. Bowen, 183 Ill. 2d 103, 118 (1998)); see also\n       Roberts, 448 U.S. at 74 (stating a witness is not unavailable under the sixth\n       amendment unless the prosecutor has made good-faith efforts to obtain his presence\n       at trial). The same applies when the State seeks to introduce hearsay statements\n       under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception.\n\n\u00b6 44       Accordingly, we hold that, when the State seeks to introduce hearsay under this\n       exception, the State must demonstrate that the witness is unavailable and that\n       reasonable, good-faith efforts were made to procure the witness\u2019s attendance by a\n       preponderance of the evidence. To the extent Golden holds the proponent of\n       statements of an unavailable witness under Rule 804(b)(5) need not demonstrate\n       good-faith efforts in securing that witness\u2019s attendance at trial, that portion of the\n       opinion is hereby overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 45                           II. Reasonable, Good-Faith Efforts\n\n\u00b6 46       Now that we have found, as did the Fourth District, that the State is required to\n       demonstrate good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s attendance at trial, we turn next\n       to the question of whether the efforts made in this case were reasonable.\n\n\u00b6 47      In defining the good-faith requirement, several general propositions have\n       emerged, namely:\n\n          \u201c \u2018The law does not require the doing of a futile act. Thus, if no possibility of\n          procuring the witness exists (as, for example, the witness\u2019 intervening death),\n          \u201cgood faith\u201d demands nothing of the prosecution. But if there is a possibility,\n          albeit remote, that affirmative measures might produce the declarant, the\n          obligation of good faith may demand their effectuation. \u201cThe lengths to which\n          the prosecution must go to produce a witness ... is a question of reasonableness.\u201d\n          [Citation.] The ultimate question is whether the witness is unavailable despite\n          good-faith efforts undertaken prior to trial to locate and present that witness. As\n          with other evidentiary proponents, the prosecution bears the burden of\n          establishing this predicate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Torres, 2012 IL 111302,\n          \u00b6 54 (quoting Roberts, 448 U.S. at 74-75).\n\n\u00b6 48       \u201c[W]hen a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of\n       additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness\u2019\n       presence [citation], but the Sixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to\n       exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\u201d Hardy v. Cross, 565\n       U.S. 65, 71-72 (2011) (per curiam). Moreover, a good-faith effort \u201cis not an ends-\n       of-the-earth effort.\u201d United States v. Chun Ya Cheung, 350 Fed. App\u2019x 19, 23 (6th\n       Cir. 2009). \u201cWhether good-faith and reasonable diligence have been exercised is\n       determined on a case-by-case basis after a careful review of the facts and\n       circumstances.\u201d People v. Smith, 275 Ill. App. 3d 207, 215 (1995).\n\n\u00b6 49       In this case, Collins received numerous threats from defendant\u2019s family and\n       friends and, as a result, fled to Iowa in February 2020. He initially met with\n       detectives in Iowa in March 2020, and nothing indicated he planned on not\n       cooperating with police or intended to move elsewhere. However, he eventually\n       stopped responding, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f\u00b6 50       Detective Christian testified that, when he last attempted to call Collins\u2019s phone\n       number, he did not recognize the voice of the person who answered and that person\n       said he had the wrong number. In his attempts to find Collins, Christian posted\n       Collins\u2019s information on the I-Board in February 2021, alerting local law-\n       enforcement agencies and officers. He reposted the information in April and May\n       2021. Although the posting was viewed hundreds of times, Christian did not receive\n       any responses. He also contacted law-enforcement officers in Davenport, Iowa, but\n       they had no contact with Collins.\n\n\u00b6 51       In August 2021, Christian also researched various databases to try to locate a\n       recent address for Collins. After doing so, he and another detective attempted to\n       make contact at an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but no one\n       appeared to be inside. They went to Collins\u2019s former address on Springfield Avenue\n       in Champaign, but it appeared no one lived at the house. They went to the residence\n       of Collins\u2019s brother on Dale Drive in Champaign, but although Christian suspected\n       people were inside, no one answered the door. Detectives traveled to an address in\n       Iowa, but no one was at the house. They also tried two addresses in Kendall County\n       without success.\n\n\u00b6 52       Christian served a subpoena in Aurora on defendant\u2019s mother, who was related\n       to Collins, and she stated she had no contact with Collins. None of defendant\u2019s\n       other family members provided any information on Collins\u2019s whereabouts.\n       Defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls indicated that he and his counsel had been unable\n       to locate Collins.\n\n\u00b6 53       From all accounts, Collins did not want to be found. Notwithstanding that fact,\n       Detective Christian utilized the information available to him in an ongoing attempt\n       to find him. Through the I-Board postings, the phone call to Collins\u2019s last known\n       number, and the visits to multiple addresses in different counties and different\n       states, Christian made good-faith efforts to locate Collins without success. While\n       the State\u2019s efforts might not be considered extraordinary, the question here is\n       whether the efforts to locate Collins were reasonable. We find that they were.\n\n\u00b6 54      Defendant, however, argues more could have been done. Specifically,\n       defendant argues the State could have mailed subpoenas to the addresses Collins\n       was affiliated with, Collins could have been listed as a missing person in LEADS,\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f       and Collins\u2019s phone records could have been subpoenaed to help learn his\n       whereabouts.\n\n\u00b6 55       We find the success of the proposed actions speculative at best. As to the\n       mailing of a subpoena, there is no indication that Collins was living at any of the\n       addresses Christian visited, and thus any such attempt at mailing the subpoena\n       would most likely have been futile. Christian also testified he could not place\n       Collins\u2019s information in LEADS because he had not been served with a subpoena.\n       A missing person can be placed into LEADS when there is a reasonable concern\n       for that person\u2019s safety, but it requires a \u201cmissing person report,\u201d and Collins was\n       not so much missing as he was intentionally not wanting to be found. See LEADS\n       3.0 Manual, Ill. State Police (Apr. 25, 2022), https:\/\/isp.illinois.gov\/Law\n       Enforcement\/LEADS3Manual                [https:\/\/perma.cc\/HT2W-94JV].         Lastly,\n       subpoenaing Collins\u2019s phone records would not guarantee finding him, given his\n       clear intention not to be discovered. See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 76 (noting \u201cthe great\n       improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\n       would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept\n       of reasonableness required their execution\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 56       Defendant also cites several cases that he contends show what reasonable,\n       good-faith efforts look like and how they, when compared to this case, prove the\n       State\u2019s efforts were deficient. See e.g., United States v. Smith, 928 F.3d 1215 (11th\n       Cir. 2019); People v. Payne, 30 Ill. App. 3d 624 (1975). However, these cases and\n       others like them deal with facts that are distinguishable from those of the case\n       before us. Moreover, the reasonableness of the State\u2019s efforts depends on an\n       analysis of the specific facts of each individual case, eschewing a rigid case-by-\n       case comparison. See United States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31, 36 (2003) (treating\n       \u201creasonableness as a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is\n       likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of circumstances in a\n       given case\u201d); Smith, 928 F.3d at 1228 (noting \u201cthere is no brightline rule for\n       reasonableness\u201d and \u201ca reasonableness inquiry necessarily is fact-specific and\n       examines the totality of the factual circumstances of each particular case\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 57      While \u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things\u201d (Roberts, 448\n       U.S. at 75), nothing indicates Christian learned of tips or leads about Collins\u2019s\n       whereabouts and failed to follow up on them. Although the State\u2019s efforts in\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f       locating Collins failed to bear fruit, they were in the end reasonable. Given the\n       totality of the facts and circumstances here, the circuit court\u2019s finding that the State\n       made reasonable, good-faith efforts to locate Collins was not against the manifest\n       weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 58       As we find no error in the admission of Collins\u2019s statements, we need not\n       address defendant\u2019s final claim that the introduction of the statements violated his\n       right to confront a witness against him.\n\n\n\u00b6 59                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 60       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment, which\n       affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n\n\n\u00b6 61      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f","                                      2024 IL 128644\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 128644)\n\n               THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Appellant, v.\n                          RUSSELL A. FREY, Appellee.\n\n\n                              Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n        JUSTICE ROCHFORD delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n\n        Chief Justice Theis and Justices Neville, Overstreet, Holder White,\n     Cunningham, and O\u2019Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\u00b61       Petitioner, Russell A. Frey, was convicted in the circuit court of Lee County of\n     three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child (720 ILCS 5\/11-\n     1.40(a)(1) (West 2010)). The court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms\n     totaling 50 years. The appellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence. People\n     v. Frey, 2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U. Petitioner then filed a pro se postconviction\n\f     petition. See 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U. The trial court appointed counsel for\n     petitioner when it failed to rule on the petition within 90 days. Id. \u00b6 9. Counsel later\n     moved to withdraw, arguing that petitioner had no meritorious claims. Id. \u00b6 10. The\n     trial court granted the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 11. The State moved to dismiss the\n     petition, adopting counsel\u2019s arguments from the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n     trial court granted the motion to dismiss. Id. The appellate court vacated and\n     remanded with directions, holding that postconviction counsel did not provide\n     reasonable assistance of counsel when he failed to ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s\n     claims. Id. \u00b6 36. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the\n     appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       The State charged petitioner with three counts of predatory criminal sexual\n     assault of a child. The State alleged that petitioner committed three acts of sexual\n     penetration on his 12-year-old daughter. The cause proceeded to a jury trial.\n     Approximately two hours into its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge\n     asking whether the burden of proof required physical evidence. The court, with the\n     consent of the parties, responded, \u201c[y]ou are to decide this case based on the\n     evidence you have seen and heard together with the instructions I have given you.\u201d\n     Later that evening, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts. The court\n     polled the jurors, and each confirmed that this was his or her verdict. The court\n     denied petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to consecutive prison\n     terms of 10, 15, and 25 years.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting certain\n     testimony from petitioner\u2019s stepson and a letter that petitioner had written to the\n     state\u2019s attorney. Frey, 2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U, \u00b6 47. The appellate court held\n     that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony from\n     petitioner\u2019s stepson. Id. \u00b6 57. As for the letter, the court concluded that its probative\n     value outweighed any prejudice to petitioner. Id. \u00b6 61. However, the court then\n     explained that, even if it were to agree with petitioner that the prejudice arising\n     from the letter outweighed its probative value, any error in admitting it was\n     harmless. Id. \u00b6 62. In arguing against the error being harmless, petitioner contended\n     that it was a close case. Id. \u00b6 63. He relied on the note from the jury asking whether\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f     physical evidence was required for the State to meet its burden of proof. Id.\n     Petitioner also relied on a second jury note explaining that the jurors were initially\n     deadlocked. Id. \u00b6 63 n.2. However, the appellate court concluded that this note was\n     not sent to the trial court:\n\n              \u201cThe defendant also points out that the record contains a second note\n         apparently written by the jury, which reads, \u2018Please advise\u2014We have 10 guilty\n         (all 3 counts) 2 not guilty all 3 counts. The 2 not guilty are firm that the State\n         did not prove guilt on all the counts.\u2019 However, there is absolutely no indication\n         in the record as to the source of this note. The trial transcript reflects that the\n         jury retired to deliberate about 4 p.m. About 6 p.m., it sent out the note regarding\n         physical evidence, and the trial court called the attorneys back to discuss the\n         appropriate response, which it then delivered to the jury. The bailiff notified the\n         court that the jury had reached a verdict shortly before 10 p.m. There is no\n         mention whatsoever of the second note regarding the 10-2 split in the jury, and\n         no explanation for its presence in the common law record. Accordingly, we\n         have difficulty in determining what weight, if any, should be placed on the\n         second note. Ordinarily, when the record is silent on a point, we must presume\n         that the trial court acted in conformity with the law. In re Estate of Cargola,\n         2017 IL App (1st) 151823, \u00b6 17. A trial court generally must address on the\n         record any notes it receives from the jury. See People v. Childs, 159 Ill. 2d 217,\n         228-29 (1994). We presume that the trial court\u2019s failure to address the second\n         note on the record indicates that the jury ultimately chose not to send out the\n         second note. This presumption is buttressed by the fact that the trial court took\n         great pains to properly address the note it received about physical evidence.\u201d\n         Id.\n\n     Finally, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s cumulative error argument. Id. \u00b6 64. The\n     court noted that, even if it viewed the admission of the letter as error, a petitioner\n     cannot argue cumulative error based on one error. Id.\n\n\u00b65       Petitioner then filed the pro se postconviction petition that is the subject of this\n     appeal. See 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U. In the body of the petition, petitioner\n     presents two claims for relief: an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a\n     proportionate penalties sentencing claim. The petition begins by explaining that\n     \u201c[t]he main claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Over the next two pages,\n\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f     petitioner details five specific ways in which he believed that trial counsel was\n     ineffective. On the next page, he argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for\n     failing to raise the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. He next alleges\n     that both trial and appellate counsel \u201cfell short when it comes to the investigation\n     done in this case.\u201d In the concluding paragraph of the ineffective assistance of\n     counsel portion of the petition, petitioner quotes Justice Black\u2019s dissent in Betts v.\n     Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 476 (1942) (Black, J., dissenting, joined by Douglas and\n     Murphy, JJ.), for the proposition that \u201c[w]hether a man is innocent cannot be\n     determined from a trial in which, as here, denial of counsel has made it impossible\n     to conclude, with any satisfactory degree of certainty, that the defendant\u2019s case was\n     adequately presented.\u201d In the next two sentences, he argues that he is entitled to a\n     new trial because he has met both prongs of the Strickland test. See Strickland v.\n     Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The concluding sentence of this final paragraph\n     is: \u201cThe initial jury could not agree on a guilty verdict in this case, yet the Judge\n     told them they could not leave that night unless they all agreed on something, being\n     outnumbered and pressured they took the defendants [sic] freedom!\u201d\n\n\u00b66       On the next page of the petition, petitioner presents his proportionate penalties\n     claim. The claim is set forth in a paragraph titled \u201cConstitutional Violation.\u201d\n     Petitioner begins by noting that he was sentenced to a total of 50 years after a jury\n     verdict in which two jurors initially voted not guilty. Petitioner asserts that the judge\n     told the jurors that they should continue deliberating and that they could not leave\n     until they agree. Petitioner then says that this caused him to be sentenced to a\n     de facto life sentence and that the court failed to consider his rehabilitative\n     potential. Petitioner cites the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois\n     Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 11) and argues that he will likely not survive\n     his time in prison. Petitioner argued that the court imposing a sentence that will not\n     allow him to ever again be a productive citizen disregarded the central goal of our\n     penal system.\n\n\u00b67       The next two pages of the petition are petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Appointment of\n     Counsel.\u201d Petitioner explains that he is without sufficient funds to pay for the costs\n     of the proceedings or to hire an attorney, that he has a constitutional right to access\n     to the courts, and that his claims are not frivolous.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f\u00b68         Petitioner appended to the petition the affidavit of his sister, Roxanne Shaffer.\n       The affidavit is preceded by a page titled \u201cNewly Discovered Evidence.\u201d In a\n       paragraph, he explains the significance of Shaffer\u2019s affidavit:\n\n          \u201cOn July 25, 2019 Roxanne Shaffer made a Sworn Affidavit on behalf of the\n          defendant which is claiming a violation of the defendants [sic] right to due\n          process by forcing the jury to come to a unanimous verdict or they were not\n          allowed to leave that night despite a 10-2 verdict! Failure of trial counsel to\n          fully depose all witnesses also adds this to the claim for ineffective assistance\n          of trial counsel.\u201d\n\n\u00b69         In Shaffer\u2019s affidavit, she says that at approximately 9 p.m. on the date of her\n       brother\u2019s conviction, the jury sent a note saying that the verdict was 10 to 2.\n       According to Shaffer, the jurors asked if they could continue the next day, but the\n       judge denied the request, saying that he had a murder trial beginning the next day\n       and that he did not want to postpone it. Within half an hour to 45 minutes, the jury\n       came back with a guilty verdict. Shaffer said that she believed that this took away\n       petitioner\u2019s right to due process.\n\n\u00b6 10       On May 13, 2020, the trial court appointed attorney Eric Arnquist to represent\n       petitioner. The court explained that it was appointing counsel because the 90-day\n       time frame for entering an order on the petition had elapsed.\n\n\u00b6 11        On October 13, 2020, Arnquist filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for\n       petitioner. In the motion, Arnquist noted that the petition had not received a first\n       stage review by the trial court. Arnquist contended that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked\n       merit and that, pursuant to People v. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, he would explain\n       why. Arnquist then went through petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of\n       trial and appellate counsel and explained why they lacked merit. He next explained\n       why petitioner\u2019s sentencing claim lacked merit. Arnquist concluded the motion\n       with a certificate pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Arnquist certified that he had consulted with petitioner to ascertain his contentions\n       of constitutional rights, had examined the record of proceedings from the trial, and\n       had made any amendments to the pro se petition that were necessary for an\n       adequate presentation of petitioner\u2019s contentions.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f\u00b6 12       At a hearing on the motion, Arnquist said that he reviewed his motion to\n       withdraw in detail with petitioner. Arnquist further explained that he had reviewed\n       the record on multiple occasions and had considered every page of it. He also\n       reviewed everything that petitioner had filed and all correspondence with\n       petitioner. He also reviewed the appellate court decision in the original appeal.\n       Arnquist said that petitioner had asked him to reach out to potential witnesses and\n       that he had done so. However, he was not able to make contact with everyone that\n       petitioner wanted him to. The court asked petitioner if he had reviewed the motion\n       to withdraw with Arnquist. Petitioner responded, \u201cYeah. I object to him\n       withdrawing.\u201d The court then granted the motion to withdraw, explaining that it\n       agreed with Arnquist\u2019s assessment of the issues.\n\n\u00b6 13       The State then asked for leave of court to file a motion to dismiss instanter. The\n       court granted the motion. In the motion, the State adopted the reasoning and\n       conclusions of Arnquist\u2019s motion to withdraw. At a hearing on the motion to\n       dismiss, the State stood on the motion. The court asked petitioner if he had anything\n       to argue in response to the State\u2019s motion. Petitioner responded that he had asked\n       Arnquist to make some phone calls and that Arnquist had not made them. The court\n       then asked petitioner if he had anything to argue in response to the motion to\n       dismiss. Petitioner responded, \u201cOther than the fact that my trial lawyer didn\u2019t do\n       everything he could to get me a not-guilty verdict. That\u2019s all I can argue with.\u201d The\n       court then asked petitioner if he had anything else to argue. Petitioner responded,\n       \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The court granted the motion to dismiss, stating that it agreed\n       with Arnquist\u2019s assessment that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit.\n\n\u00b6 14       Petitioner appealed, arguing that postconviction counsel did not provide\n       reasonable assistance under Rule 651(c) because his motion to withdraw failed to\n       address petitioner\u2019s due process claim concerning the jury note. Accordingly, he\n       contended that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing postconviction\n       counsel to withdraw. 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 14. The appellate court agreed\n       with petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 15      The court noted that Rule 651(c) prescribes specific duties to ensure that\n       postconviction petitioners receive a reasonable level of assistance. Id. \u00b6 20. If, after\n       demonstrating compliance with Rule 651(c), counsel determines that the pro se\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       petition is frivolous or patently without merit, counsel may move to withdraw. Id.\n       \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 16       The court explained that its review of an order permitting withdrawal differs\n       based on how the petition arrived at the second stage. Id. \u00b6 23. If the petition\n       advanced to the second stage because the trial court found it potentially meritorious,\n       then the motion to withdraw must contain at least some explanation as to why all\n       of the claims set forth in the petition are so lacking in legal and factual support that\n       withdrawal is allowed. Id. (citing Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 27). If, however, the\n       petition advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, \u201c \u2018judicial\n       economy sometimes dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where\n       the motion to withdraw is deficient.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 24 (quoting People v. Moore, 2018 IL\n       App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 38). The court noted that, in that situation, withdrawal may be\n       allowed if counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and the record demonstrates that the\n       claims in the pro se petition are frivolous or patently without merit. Id. \u00b6 26.\n       However, the court explained it had previously held in Moore that, even when the\n       petition advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, appointed\n       counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw must address the potential merit of all the petition\u2019s\n       claims. Id. \u00b6 27. In the court\u2019s view, the duty of counsel is the same no matter how\n       the petition advances to the second stage. The difference is that, when the petition\n       advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, judicial economy may\n       sometimes warrant affirming the grant of a motion to withdraw even in the face of\n       a deficient motion. Id.\n\n\u00b6 17       The court explained that it held in Moore that, when the motion to withdraw\n       fails to address one of the pro se petitioner\u2019s claims, the case must be remanded\n       even when counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate. Id. \u00b6 28. Moore read People v.\n       Greer, 212 Ill. 2d 192 (2004), to hold that \u201c \u2018the reviewing court cannot relieve\n       counsel of his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u2019 \u201d\n       (Emphasis in original.) 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 27 (quoting Moore, 2018 IL\n       App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 43). The court explained that Moore stands for the proposition\n       that, if counsel does not address one of the pro se petition\u2019s claims in the motion to\n       withdraw, then counsel has not fulfilled his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to\n       ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 28.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f\u00b6 18        The court then held that the present case is governed by Moore. The court noted\n       that counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw did not mention \u201cthe claim based on the second\n       jury note or any of the circumstances surrounding the claim.\u201d Id. \u00b6 29. The court\n       rejected the State\u2019s argument that, when a petition advances to the second stage\n       based on trial court inaction, the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate is sufficient to\n       raise a presumption that counsel complied with the rule. Id. \u00b6 30. The court\n       explained that it would not \u201cpresume compliance when the record suggests\n       otherwise.\u201d Id. \u00b6 31. The court believed that the petition, liberally construed, set\n       forth a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id. \u00b6 32. The court rejected\n       the State\u2019s assertion that petitioner had forfeited the claim by not raising the issue\n       pro se at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Id. The court noted that the State had\n       failed to cite any authority for applying forfeiture in such a manner as to excuse an\n       attorney\u2019s lack of compliance with Rule 651(c). Id. Moreover, the court held that\n       petitioner\u2019s statement at the hearing that his counsel did not make requested phone\n       calls and did not \u201c \u2018do everything he could to get [defendant] a not-guilty verdict\u2019 \u201d\n       fairly encompassed a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id.\n       Accordingly, as it had done in Moore, the court vacated the orders allowing the\n       motion to withdraw and dismissing the petition and remanded the cause with\n       directions to appoint new postconviction counsel for petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 19      This court allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff.\n       Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 20                                        ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 21       On appeal, the State argues that the appellate court improperly applied the\n       Kuehner standard, which requires appointed counsel moving to withdraw to explain\n       why each of the claims in the pro se petition lacks merit. Because this petition\n       advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, the State argues that it\n       is governed by Greer. According to the State, the relevant inquiry under Greer is\n       whether (1) counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and (2) the petition\u2019s claims lack\n       merit. The State contends that counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and that a due\n       process claim based on the second jury note is frivolous and patently without merit.\n       Both the scope of an attorney\u2019s duties under Rule 651(c) and an attorney\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f       compliance with that rule are reviewed de novo. See People v. Smith, 2020 IL App\n       (1st) 181220, \u00b6 13.\n\n\u00b6 22       The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) provides a mechanism for a criminal\n       defendant to assert that \u201cin the proceedings which resulted in his or her conviction\n       there was a substantial denial of his or her rights under the Constitution of the\n       United States or of the State of Illinois or both.\u201d 725 ILCS 5\/122-1(a)(1) (West\n       2018). At the first stage of postconviction proceedings, the circuit court must\n       independently review the postconviction petition and shall dismiss it if it is\n       \u201cfrivolous or is patently without merit.\u201d Id. \u00a7 122-2.1(a)(2). The petition advances\n       to the second stage if (1) the court fails to rule on the petition within 90 days,\n       regardless of the petition\u2019s merit, or (2) the facts alleged in the petition state an\n       arguable claim of constitutional deprivation. People v. Urzua, 2023 IL 127789,\n       \u00b6 32.\n\n\u00b6 23       At the second stage, counsel may be appointed to assist an indigent defendant.\n       Id. \u00b6 33. In a postconviction proceeding, there is no constitutional right to the\n       assistance of counsel. People v. Custer, 2019 IL 123339, \u00b6 30. Rather, the right to\n       counsel is a matter of \u201clegislative grace.\u201d People v. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d 64, 73 (1988).\n       A postconviction petitioner is entitled only to the level of assistance granted by the\n       Act, which this court has determined to be a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 level of assistance\u201d\n       (People v. Flores, 153 Ill. 2d 264, 276 (1992)), which is less than that afforded by\n       the federal and state constitutions at trial (People v. Pendleton, 223 Ill. 2d 458, 472\n       (2006)).\n\n\u00b6 24      Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017), which governs the\n       appointment of counsel in postconviction proceedings provides, in part, as follows:\n\n              \u201cThe record filed in that court shall contain a showing, which may be made\n          by the certificate of petitioner\u2019s attorney, that the attorney has consulted with\n          petitioner by phone, mail, electronic means or in person to ascertain his or her\n          contentions of deprivation of constitutional rights, has examined the record of\n          the proceedings at the trial, and has made any amendments to the petitions filed\n          pro se that are necessary for an adequate presentation of petitioner\u2019s\n          contentions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f       Postconviction counsel\u2019s obligation is to investigate and properly present the claims\n       raised by the petitioner. Pendleton, 223 Ill. 2d at 472. Counsel may, but is not\n       required to, raise additional claims on the petitioner\u2019s behalf. Id. at 476. If counsel\n       files a certificate pursuant to Rule 651(c), a rebuttable presumption arises that the\n       petitioner received the reasonable assistance of counsel. People v. Addison, 2023\n       IL 127119, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 25       In Greer, this court explained that, when appointed counsel determines that the\n       claims in the petition lack merit and moves to withdraw, counsel \u201cshould make\n       some effort to explain why defendant\u2019s claims are frivolous or patently without\n       merit.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Greer, 212 Ill. 2d at 212. In that case, postconviction\n       counsel asserted that he could not \u201c \u2018properly substantiate\u2019 \u201d the petitioner\u2019s claim.\n       Id. at 200. Although this court cautioned that whether postconviction counsel can\n       properly substantiate a petitioner\u2019s claim is not the standard by which counsel\n       should be judging a petitioner\u2019s postconviction claim, this court stated that it would\n       not reverse the granting of the motion to withdraw when counsel fulfilled his Rule\n       651(c) duties and the record demonstrated that the petitioner\u2019s claims were\n       frivolous and without merit. Id. at 212.\n\n\u00b6 26       In Kuehner, this court was again faced with a situation in which appointed\n       counsel moved to withdraw but did not explain why each of the petitioner\u2019s issues\n       lacked merit. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 9. Counsel argued in her motion that the\n       petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit. She filed a supporting brief that addressed in detail\n       her reasons for concluding that two of the petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit. Counsel,\n       however, failed to address or even acknowledge one of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id.\n       This court explained that the case was in a different procedural posture than Greer.\n       Id. \u00b6 18. In Greer, the petition had advanced to the second stage when the court\n       failed to rule on the petition within 90 days. Id. \u00b6 19. In Kuehner, the petition\n       advanced to the second stage because the trial court determined that it was not\n       frivolous or patently without merit. Id. \u00b6 20. This court concluded that, when an\n       attorney moves to withdraw in that situation, he or she \u201cmay not simply move to\n       withdraw on the grounds that the pro se claims are frivolous or patently without\n       merit, as the trial court already has ruled expressly to the contrary.\u201d Id. \u00b6 21. Rather,\n       counsel must demonstrate, with respect to each of the pro se claims, \u201cwhy the trial\n       court\u2019s initial assessment was incorrect.\u201d Id. In other words, the court explained:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f          \u201cif we were willing to say in Greer that a motion to withdraw should include\n          such explanations when the petition advances to stage two by default, we are\n          now prepared to say that such a motion must include such explanations when\n          the petition advances to the second stage by affirmative judicial action.\u201d\n          (Emphasis in original.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 27       Taken together, Greer and Kuehner establish that, whether a petition advances\n       to the second stage based on judicial inaction or because the trial court found\n       potential merit to the claims, a properly filed motion to withdraw is one that sets\n       forth why the claims lack merit. This is confirmed by this court\u2019s recent decision in\n       Urzua, 2023 IL 127789. In that case, the petition advanced to the second stage\n       because of trial court inaction. Id. \u00b6 9. In setting forth the governing law, this court\n       cited Kuehner for the proposition that, when counsel determines that he is ethically\n       obligated to withdraw, \u201cappointed counsel must explain why each of the\n       petitioner\u2019s pro se claims lacks merit.\u201d Id. \u00b6 33.\n\n\u00b6 28       Thus, although counsel\u2019s obligation is the same in either scenario, the\n       consequences of filing a defective motion are potentially different. Kuehner\n       establishes a rule of automatic reversal if the petition has advanced based on a trial\n       court finding that the claims are potentially meritorious but counsel fails to address\n       one of those claims in the motion to withdraw. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6\u00b6 22-\n       24. In a case in which the petition has advanced based on trial court inaction, this\n       court has recognized that, in certain circumstances, reversal is not required. In\n       Greer, this court chose not to reverse when it appeared that counsel had fulfilled\n       his duties under Rule 651(c) and the record showed that the petition was frivolous\n       and without merit. Greer, 212 Ill. 2d at 212. In other words, as the appellate court\n       has recognized, Greer stands for the proposition that \u201cjudicial economy sometimes\n       dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where the motion to withdraw\n       is deficient.\u201d Moore, 2018 IL App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 38.\n\n\u00b6 29       In this case, the appellate court adopted an approach that largely collapsed the\n       above framework. Although the court acknowledged and accepted the difference\n       between Kuehner and Greer (2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26), it then\n       adopted a framework that would require automatic reversal whenever a claim is not\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw. The court determined that, liberally construed,\n       petitioner\u2019s petition contained a due process claim based on the second jury note.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f       Id. \u00b6 32. The court believed that postconviction counsel\u2019s failure to mention this\n       claim in the motion to withdraw necessarily meant that counsel had failed to\n       ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 29. Thus, because Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claims, counsel had violated Rule 651(c) by failing\n       to address this claim in the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The court\n       acknowledged that counsel had filed a Rule 651(c) certificate (id. \u00b6 10) but\n       impliedly determined that petitioner had rebutted the presumption of reasonable\n       assistance arising from the certificate (id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). And, because Rule 651(c)\n       violations are not subject to harmless error analysis (id. \u00b6 28), reversal and remand\n       for the appointment of new counsel were required (id. \u00b6 34). The framework\n       adopted by the appellate court necessarily means that anytime a postconviction\n       petitioner can identify a claim that the petition can be liberally construed to assert,\n       automatic reversal is required if the claim is not mentioned in counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw.\n\n\u00b6 30       The problem with the appellate court\u2019s position is that it is not always possible\n       to discern what claims a pro se postconviction petitioner is raising. That is why\n       Rule 651(c) ties the \u201cascertainment\u201d requirement to a consultation requirement.\n       The requirement under Rule 651(c) is not merely to ascertain the petitioner\u2019s\n       claims, as the appellate court stated. See id. \u00b6 27. Rather, Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to certify that he or she \u201cconsulted with petitioner by phone, mail,\n       electronic means or in person to ascertain his or her contentions of deprivation of\n       constitutional rights.\u201d (Emphases added.) Ill. S. Ct. R. 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Postconviction counsel certified that he did so, following which he filed a motion\n       to withdraw that addressed petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and\n       sentencing claims. Because counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate, a rebuttable\n       presumption of reasonable assistance arose. Addison, 2023 IL 127119, \u00b6 21.\n       Petitioner can overcome that presumption by showing that postconviction counsel\n       did not substantially comply with the strictures of the rule. Id.\n\n\u00b6 31       We hold that petitioner did not rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance.\n       Nothing in the record establishes that counsel failed to consult with petitioner to\n       ascertain his claims of a deprivation of constitutional rights. The appellate court\n       concluded that petitioner rebutted the presumption because the petition could be\n       liberally construed to assert a due process claim. 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 32.\n       However, the petition was, at best, ambiguous on that matter, and postconviction\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f       counsel certified that he consulted with petitioner to ascertain his claims. Following\n       that consultation, he filed a motion to withdraw addressing the petition\u2019s ineffective\n       assistance of counsel and sentencing claims. There is nothing in the record to show\n       that counsel did not consult with petitioner to ascertain his claims. No one but\n       petitioner and postconviction counsel knows what was said during those\n       consultations. If petitioner confirmed that the claims he intended to raise were\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties claim, the record\n       would look precisely as it does now. Postconviction counsel addressed the merits\n       of those issues in his motion to withdraw, and he told the court that he went over\n       the motion in detail with petitioner. The trial court asked petitioner if he had\n       anything to say in response. Petitioner stated that he objected to counsel\n       withdrawing, but he did not say that counsel had overlooked any of his claims. At\n       the hearing on the motion to dismiss the petition, petitioner argued that he asked\n       postconviction counsel to make some phone calls and that counsel did not do so.\n       He also argued that he did not believe that trial counsel did everything he could to\n       obtain a not-guilty verdict. He did not mention a due process claim or state that one\n       had been overlooked by counsel. In pointing this out we are not, as petitioner\n       argues, holding that he forfeited a claim by his silence or that we are shifting part\n       of the burden to him. We are simply acknowledging that there is nothing in the\n       record to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose from counsel\u2019s\n       Rule 651(c) certificate. Moreover, we disagree with the appellate court\u2019s assertion\n       that petitioner stating that counsel did not make all requested phone calls and that\n       trial counsel did not do everything he could to get petitioner a not-guilty verdict\n       \u201cfairly encompassed the due process claim.\u201d See id. We do not see how this can be\n       understood to be referencing counsel overlooking a due process claim based on the\n       second jury note.\n\n\u00b6 32        The most natural way to read the petition is that it raises substantive claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties sentencing claim.\n       The petition is divided into three sections: (1) the substantive claims, (2) the motion\n       for the appointment of counsel, and (3) the supporting documentation. Although\n       the jury note is mentioned in both sections of the substantive portion of the petition,\n       it is tied to petitioner\u2019s other claims. There is no due process claim asserted in the\n       substantive portion of the petition. The only time due process is mentioned is in the\n       supporting documentation. Petitioner\u2019s sister claimed in her affidavit that the trial\n       judge denied the jurors\u2019 request to continue their deliberations the next day and that\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f       she \u201cbelieve[d] this took away [petitioner\u2019s] right of due process.\u201d On the preceding\n       page, petitioner described the affidavit and explained why he was attaching it. He\n       explained that it adds to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 33       It seems clear that this is how appointed counsel read the petition. He filed a\n       certificate pursuant to Rule 651(c) in which he stated that he consulted with\n       petitioner to ascertain his deprivation of constitutional rights. Counsel\u2019s failure to\n       mention a due process claim based on the second jury note strongly suggests that,\n       after consulting with petitioner, counsel reasonably ascertained that petitioner was\n       not asserting a standalone due process claim based on the second jury note. There\n       is no question that his intent was to address all of petitioner\u2019s claims in his motion\n       to withdraw. He stated in the motion that it was being filed pursuant to this court\u2019s\n       holding in Kuehner and that his obligation was to explain why all of the petition\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. In Kuehner, we held that postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw was required to address claims that were \u201cspecific, substantial, and\n       sufficiently present in the petition to warrant appointed counsel\u2019s attention.\u201d\n       Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 23. Counsel did so by addressing the claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing error.\n\n\u00b6 34        Petitioner relies on Moore, 2018 IL App (2d) 170120, in which the appellate\n       court held that the petitioner had failed to comply with Rule 651(c) when counsel\n       filed a motion to withdraw that omitted one of the petitioner\u2019s claims. The case had\n       proceeded to stage two when the trial court failed to rule on the petition within 90\n       days. The court held that counsel had failed to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claim that\n       appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge amendments to the\n       indictment. Id. \u00b6 41. The court acknowledged the pro se petition\u2019s \u201clength and\n       density\u201d but stated that it could not excuse compliance with Rule 651(c)\u2019s mandate\n       that counsel ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 42. The State argues that Moore\n       was incorrectly decided because (1) it decoupled the ascertainment requirement\n       from the consultation requirement and (2) the court failed to acknowledge\u2014let\n       alone apply\u2014the presumption that arises from the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate.\n       For purposes of this appeal, we do not need to address the correctness of Moore, as\n       it is clearly distinguishable. In Moore, there was an omitted claim that was clearly\n       stated in the petition. See id. \u00b6 24. Because we are not faced with that situation, we\n       have no need to weigh in on the correctness of that decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f\u00b6 35        Petitioner has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose\n       from counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We note that, in addition to arguing that\n       postconviction counsel complied with Rule 651(c), the State also argues that any\n       due process claim based on the second jury note would lack merit. Because this\n       case arose from a situation in which the petition proceeded to stage two because of\n       trial court inaction, the State contends that Greer applies and that the relevant\n       inquiry is whether counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and whether petitioner\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. As explained above, however, regardless of how the petition\n       arrives at the second stage, a proper motion to withdraw should explain why the\n       petition\u2019s claims lack merit. The separate Greer standard comes into play only\n       when the court is faced with a deficient motion to withdraw. That is not the situation\n       here. Petitioner has not established that the motion to withdraw was deficient.\n       Because petitioner failed to rebut the presumption that arose from counsel\u2019s Rule\n       651(c) certificate, we presume that the petitioner\u2019s claims are the ones counsel\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw, and petitioner has not challenged either\n       postconviction counsel\u2019s or the trial court\u2019s assessment of the merits of those\n       claims.\n\n\n\u00b6 36                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 37      Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance arising from\n       counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We therefore reverse the appellate court\u2019s\n       judgment. We affirm the trial court\u2019s orders allowing postconviction counsel to\n       withdraw and dismissing petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 38      Appellate court judgment reversed.\n\n\u00b6 39      Circuit court judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f","                                       2024 IL 128763\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 128763)\n\n     THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ex rel. KWAME RAOUL, Attorney General, Appellee,\n                   v. ELITE STAFFING, INC., et al., Appellants.\n\n\n                               Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n         JUSTICE NEVILLE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n\n         Chief Justice Theis and Justices Overstreet, Holder White, Rochford, and\n      O\u2019Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n         Justice Cunningham took no part in the decision.\n\n\n\n                                          OPINION\n\n\u00b61        The State of Illinois filed a complaint in which it alleged Elite Staffing, Inc.,\n      Metro Staff, Inc., and Midway Staffing, Inc. (collectively, the staffing agencies),\n      violated the Illinois Antitrust Act. 740 ILCS 10\/3 (West 2018). The staffing\n      agencies filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the act did not apply\n\f     to the charged conduct. The circuit court of Cook County denied the motion but\n     certified for interlocutory review two questions about the reach of the act:\n\n            \u201c1. Whether the definition of \u2018Service\u2019 under Section 4 of the Illinois\n        Antitrust Act, 740 ILCS 10\/4, which states that Service \u2018shall not be deemed to\n        include labor which is performed by natural persons as employees of others,\u2019\n        applies to the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole and thus excludes all labor\n        services from the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s coverage.\n\n            2. Whether the per se rule under Section 3(1) of the Illinois Antitrust Act,\n        740 ILCS 10\/3(1), which states that it applies to conspiracies among\n        \u2018competitor[s],\u2019 extends to alleged horizontal agreements facilitated by a\n        vertical noncompetitor.\u201d\n\n     The appellate court answered the second question, but instead of answering\n     question 1, it answered a different question:\n\n        \u201cwhether the exclusion of individual labor from the definition of \u2018service\u2019 in\n        section 4 of the [Illinois Antitrust Act] also excludes the labor-related services\n        provided by temporary staffing agencies and therefore exempts such agencies\n        from [its] coverage.\u201d 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b62      We granted the staffing agencies\u2019 petition for leave to appeal from the appellate\n     court decision. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (a) (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\u00b63        We hold that the Illinois Antitrust Act does not exempt from antitrust scrutiny\n     all agreements between competitors to hold down wages and to limit employment\n     opportunities for their employees. We vacate the appellate court\u2019s answer to the\n     question it formulated, answer the circuit court\u2019s first certified question, do not\n     address the second certified question because the parties have not sought our review\n     of that question and its answer, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\u00b64                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b65       The State alleged in its complaint that Colony Display (Colony) hired the\n     staffing agencies to supply the temporary workers it needed. Colony, which installs\n     fixtures and displays for home improvement and retail businesses, relies heavily on\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f     temporary workers, who form the majority of Colony\u2019s workforce. 2022 IL App\n     (1st) 210840, \u00b6 3. At Colony\u2019s request, the State alleged, the staffing agencies\n     agreed to fix the wages for their employees who worked for Colony at below-\n     market rates, and they agreed not to hire each other\u2019s employees. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Colony\n     helped the staffing agencies enforce their agreement. Id. The State claimed the\n     alleged conduct constituted an agreement between competitors to fix the price paid\n     for services and therefore that it had violated section 3(1)(a) of the Illinois Antitrust\n     Act (740 ILCS 10\/3(1) (West 2018)). 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 12. The\n     defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under section 2-615 of the Code\n     of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5\/2-615 (West 2018)), claiming that the complaint\n     did not state a cause of action because the Illinois Antitrust Act provides that\n     services otherwise subject to the act \u201cshall not be deemed to include labor which is\n     performed by natural persons as employees of others\u201d (740 ILCS 10\/4 (West\n     2018)). 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 7.\n\n\u00b66       The circuit court denied the motion but certified for interlocutory review the\n     following issue:\n\n         \u201c \u2018Whether the definition of \u201cService\u201d under Section 4 of the Illinois Antitrust\n         Act, 740 ILCS 10\/4, which states that Service \u201cshall not be deemed to include\n         labor which is performed by natural persons as employees of others,\u201d applies to\n         the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole and thus excludes all labor services from\n         the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s coverage.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b67      The parties have not asked this court to address in this appeal the second\n     question the circuit court certified for interlocutory review. See id.\n\n\n\u00b68                                     A. Appellate Court\n\n\u00b69        The appellate court found first that the question as phrased relied on an incorrect\n     assumption that, if the definition of \u201cservice\u201d applied to the Illinois Antitrust Act\n     as a whole, it exempts all labor services from the act\u2019s coverage. Id. \u00b6 11. The\n     appellate court restated the question and addressed instead the issue of \u201cwhether\n     the exclusion of individual labor from the definition of \u2018service\u2019 in section 4 of the\n     [Illinois Antitrust Act] also excludes the labor-related services provided by\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       temporary staffing agencies and therefore exempts such agencies from [its]\n       coverage.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 10       The appellate court found that the legislature narrowed the definition of service\n       \u201cto allow individuals to engage in otherwise anticompetitive behavior regarding\n       their own labor by participating in collective bargaining and related conduct.\u201d Id.\n       \u00b6 15. The appellate court found the exemption of section 4 did not extend to services\n       provided by staffing agencies. The court held:\n\n           \u201c[T]o the extent that the alleged unlawful conduct concerns restraints that they\n           place on their own services (i.e., recruiting, hiring, and managing temporary\n           employees) and do not concern restraints on a natural person\u2019s individual labor,\n           temporary staffing agencies like the Agency Defendants in this case are subject\n           to the Act\u2019s provisions and, in particular, section 3\u2019s prohibitions on\n           anticompetitive restraints on services.\u201d Id. \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 11        This court granted the agencies\u2019 petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a)\n       (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). We accepted briefs amici curiae from (1) the United States\n       Department of Justice in support of the State\u2019s position; (2) Raise the Floor\n       Alliance, National Legal Advocacy Network, and National Employment Law\n       Project in support of the State\u2019s position; and (3) Staffing Services Association of\n       Illinois and American Staffing Association in support of the staffing agencies\u2019\n       position. Ill. S. Ct. R. 345 (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 12                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13       Rule 315 gives this court jurisdiction over the appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff.\n       Oct. 1, 2021); Moore v. Chicago Park District, 2012 IL 112788, \u00b6 7. Illinois courts\n       usually limit review under Rule 308 (Ill. S. Ct. R. 308 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019)) to\n       answering the certified question, unless the question rests on an erroneous legal\n       assumption. De Bouse v. Bayer AG, 235 Ill. 2d 544, 550, 557 (2009).\n\n\u00b6 14       Both parties ask this court to answer the question certified by the circuit court\n       rather than the question the appellate court answered. We do not interpret the circuit\n       court\u2019s question as incorrectly assuming that, if the definition of service applies to\n       the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole, the act necessarily excludes all labor services\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f       from its coverage. Rather, we find that the question the circuit court certified asked\n       the appellate court to decide whether the Illinois Antitrust Act excludes from its\n       coverage all agreements concerning labor services. We will answer the circuit\n       court\u2019s certified question.\n\n\u00b6 15       On certified question review, this court should address only issues of law and\n       not the application of the law to the particular facts of the case. Rozsavolgyi v. City\n       of Aurora, 2017 IL 121048, \u00b6 21. We review de novo rulings on the interpretation\n       of a statute. Midwest Sanitary Service, Inc. v. Sandberg, Phoenix & Von Gontard,\n       P.C., 2022 IL 127327, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 16       We apply familiar principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe most fundamental\n       rule in statutory construction is to give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d Murray v.\n       Chicago Youth Center, 224 Ill. 2d 213, 235 (2007). \u201cThe statutory language, given\n       its plain and ordinary meaning, is generally the most reliable indicator of that\n       legislative intent, but a literal reading must fail if it yields absurd, inconvenient, or\n       unjust results.\u201d Cassidy v. China Vitamins, LLC, 2018 IL 122873, \u00b6 17.\n\n           \u201cWords and phrases should not be considered in isolation; rather, they must be\n           interpreted in light of other relevant provisions and the statute as a whole.\n           [Citations.] In addition to the statutory language, the court may consider the\n           purpose behind the law and the evils sought to be remedied, as well as the\n           consequences that would result from construing the law one way or the other.\u201d\n           County of Du Page v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 231 Ill. 2d 593, 604\n           (2008).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                                  A. The Statutes at Issue\n\n\u00b6 18      We must interpret five sections of the Illinois Antitrust Act: sections 2, 3, 4, 5,\n       and 11 (740 ILCS 10\/2, 3, 4, 5, 11 (West 2018)). Section 2 states that the legislature\n       adopted the act\n\n           \u201cto promote the unhampered growth of commerce and industry throughout the\n           State by prohibiting restraints of trade which are secured through monopolistic\n           or oligarchic practices and which act or tend to act to decrease competition\n           between and among persons engaged in commerce and trade, whether in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f       manufacturing, distribution, financing, and service industries or in related for-\n       profit pursuits.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 19   Section 3 provides:\n\n       \u201cEvery person shall be deemed to have committed a violation of this Act who\n       shall:\n\n             (1) Make any contract with, or engage in any combination or conspiracy\n          with, any other person who is, or but for a prior agreement would be, a\n          competitor of such person:\n\n              a. for the purpose or with the effect of fixing, controlling, or maintaining\n          the *** fee charged or paid for any service performed or received by the\n          parties thereto; [or]\n\n              b. fixing, controlling, maintaining, [or] limiting *** the sale or supply\n          of any service, for the purpose or with the effect stated in paragraph a. of\n          subsection (1)[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 3.\n\n\u00b6 20   Section 4 defines \u201cservice\u201d as follows:\n\n           \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 shall mean any activity, not covered by the definition of\n       \u2018commodity,\u2019 which is performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial\n       gain.\n           \u2018Service\u2019 shall not be deemed to include labor which is performed by natural\n       persons as employees of others.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4.\n\n\u00b6 21   Section 5 makes an exception to the broad reach of section 3:\n\n       \u201cNo provisions of this Act shall be construed to make illegal:\n\n              (1) the activities of any labor organization or of individual members\n          thereof which are directed solely to labor objectives which are legitimate\n          under the laws of either the State of Illinois or the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5.\n\n\u00b6 22   Section 11 guides the interpretation of the Illinois Antitrust Act:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f          \u201cWhen the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of a federal antitrust\n          law, the courts of this State shall use the construction of the federal law by the\n          federal courts as a guide in construing this Act.\u201d Id. \u00a7 11.\n\n\u00b6 23       This court has explained that, where the language of federal antitrust statutes\n       differs markedly from the Illinois Antitrust Act, \u201cwe must consider whether, given\n       the differences between section 3[ ] and [the federal statute], the reasoning\n       employed by the Federal courts in interpreting [the federal statute] is relevant to\n       our interpretation of section 3[ ].\u201d Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen Gallery v. Ethan Allen,\n       Inc., 162 Ill. 2d 99, 104 (1994).\n\n\u00b6 24       Because of section 11, we must also consult federal antitrust statutes. Section 1\n       of the Sherman Act provides that \u201c[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust\n       or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several\n       States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (2018).\n\n\u00b6 25      Finally, the Clayton Act provides:\n\n              \u201cThe labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.\n          Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence\n          and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for\n          the purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for\n          profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from\n          lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such\n          organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal\n          combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws.\u201d Id.\n          \u00a7 17.\n\n\n\u00b6 26                        B. Section 3 of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n\n\u00b6 27        The General Assembly patterned section 3(1)(a) of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       after section 1 of the Sherman Act. People ex rel. Scott v. College Hills Corp., 91\n       Ill. 2d 138, 150 (1982) (\u201cSection 3(1)(a) is patterned after section 1 of the Sherman\n       Act [citation], and in our construction of the Illinois Antitrust Act we are guided by\n       Federal case law construing analogous provisions of Federal legislation\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       [citation].\u201d). The United States Supreme Court succinctly summarized one\n       significant problem courts encounter when interpreting the Sherman Act:\n\n          \u201c[Section] 1 of the Sherman Act *** cannot mean what it says. The statute says\n          that \u2018every\u2019 contract that restrains trade is unlawful. But, as Mr. Justice Brandeis\n          perceptively noted, restraint is the very essence of every contract; read literally,\n          [section] 1 would outlaw the entire body of private contract law.\u201d National\n          Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-88\n          (1978).\n\n       To avoid the absurd consequences of applying the Sherman Act literally, \u201c \u2018courts\n       have construed it as precluding only those contracts or combinations which\n       \u201cunreasonably\u201d restrain competition.\u2019 \u201d Williams v. St. Joseph Hospital, 629 F.2d\n       448, 452 (7th Cir. 1980) (quoting Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356\n       U.S. 1, 5 (1958)). For many restraints of trade, federal courts adopted \u201crule of\n       reason\u201d analysis, under which the \u201ctrial court must perform a market share analysis\n       to determine whether the defendant possessed monopoly power in the relevant\n       market. *** [T]he plaintiff must show that the defendant possessed sufficient\n       monopoly power to inflict competitive injury in the relevant market.\u201d Gilbert\u2019s\n       Ethan Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 102-03.\n\n\u00b6 28       Some agreements \u201care so plainly anticompetitive [citation] that they are\n       conclusively presumed illegal without further examination under the rule of reason\n       generally applied in Sherman Act cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n       Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 8 (1979).\n       \u201c \u2018If a practice is within the per se category, all you have to prove to establish a\n       violation is that the defendant engaged in the practice; you do not have to show that\n       in fact the practice has had or will have an adverse effect on competition.\u2019 \u201d\n       Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 105 (quoting Marrese v. American\n       Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 692 F.2d 1083, 1093 (7th Cir. 1982).\n       \u201c[A]greements among competitors to fix prices on their individual goods or\n       services are among those concerted activities that the Court has held to be within\n       the per se category.\u201d Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. at 8.\n\n\u00b6 29       The complaint here alleges that competitors, the staffing agencies, agreed to fix\n       the wages they would pay to their employees sent to work for Colony. The alleged\n       agreement falls squarely within the realm of conduct so clearly anticompetitive that\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f       it violates antitrust laws without further examination under the rule of reason. See\n       id.; Quinonez v. National Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, Inc., 540 F.2d 824, 828-29\n       (5th Cir. 1976).\n\n\u00b6 30       Applying federal standards (see Laughlin v. Evanston Hospital, 133 Ill. 2d 374,\n       383-84 (1990)), we find that a multiemployer agreement to restrict wages and not\n       to hire each other\u2019s employees violates section 3 of the Illinois Antitrust Act unless\n       section 4 of the act exempts the alleged agreement from the coverage of the act.\n\n\n\u00b6 31                         C. Section 4 of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n\n\u00b6 32       Considered in isolation, section 4, which exempts from the Illinois Antitrust\n       Act\u2019s coverage \u201clabor which is performed by natural persons as employees of\n       others\u201d (740 ILCS 10\/4 (West 2018)), appears to exempt from antitrust scrutiny all\n       agreements concerning wages and conditions of employment, regardless of their\n       anticompetitive effects. But if we construe the definition so broadly, it conflicts\n       with the stated purpose of the act, which the legislature designed\n\n          \u201cto promote the unhampered growth of commerce and industry throughout the\n          State by prohibiting restraints of trade which are secured through monopolistic\n          or oligarchic practices and which act or tend to act to decrease competition\n          between and among persons engaged in commerce and trade, whether in\n          manufacturing, distribution, financing, and service industries or in related for-\n          profit pursuits.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 33       Just as the broad language of the Sherman Act conflicted with its purpose and\n       led to absurd results, the broad language of the definition in section 4 conflicts with\n       the purpose of the Illinois Antitrust Act. We find section 4\u2019s definition of services,\n       when considered in the context of the act as a whole, ambiguous because of the\n       conflict between the apparent reach of the exemption on superficial examination\n       and the purpose of the act. When we encounter ambiguity in a statute considered as\n       a whole, we turn to tools of interpretation to help us determine the meaning of a\n       statute. DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006) (\u201cif the language of a statute\n       is ambiguous, courts may look to tools of interpretation to ascertain the meaning of\n       a provision\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f\u00b6 34      \u201cWhere the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every\n       thing from which aid can be derived.\u201d United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch)\n       358, 386 (1805). \u201cWhen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the\n       statute, is available, there certainly can be no rule of law which forbids its use,\n       however clear the words may appear on superficial examination.\u201d (Internal\n       quotation marks omitted.) United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S.\n       534, 543-44 (1940).\n\n\u00b6 35        We have a commentary on the Illinois Antitrust Act prepared by the drafters,\n       the Chicago Bar Association\u2019s Committee on Antitrust Law (Committee). The\n       Committee prepared the commentary in 1967, two years after the legislature\n       enacted the Illinois Antitrust Act. This court has used the commentary as an aid to\n       interpreting the act. See Laughlin, 133 Ill. 2d at 386-87; Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen\n       Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 106. State archives list the sponsors of the bill that became\n       the Illinois Antitrust Act and the proponents and opponents of the bill. One of the\n       bill\u2019s proponents, Professor James Rahl, wrote an article in which he argued the\n       states should enact their own antitrust statutes because not all pernicious price\n       fixing agreements and other antitrust violations affect interstate commerce. James\n       A. Rahl, Toward a Worthwhile State Antitrust Policy, 39 Tex. L. Rev. 753, 758\n       (1961) (State Antitrust). Because Rahl appeared before the legislature as a\n       proponent of the bill the legislature enacted, we find that his article qualifies as\n       some evidence concerning the intent of the legislation. William N. Eskridge Jr., The\n       New Textualism, 37 UCLA L. Rev. 621, 636 (1990) (comments of nonlegislator\n       drafters constitute some evidence of legislative intent). We also have some\n       evidence of legislative inaction and an argument concerning the effect of\n       subsequent legislation.\n\n\u00b6 36       Because section 11 of the Illinois Antitrust Act directs our attention to federal\n       law, we start with a discussion of decisions interpreting federal antitrust law,\n       followed by discussions of the committee comments, Rahl\u2019s views, and legislative\n       inaction. Finally, we respond to an argument raised by amici supporting the staffing\n       agencies\u2019 position, who claim that a statute immunizes staffing agencies from all\n       antitrust laws.\n\n\n\u00b6 37                                1. Federal Antitrust Law\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\f\u00b6 38       The Clayton Act provides, \u201cThe labor of a human being is not a commodity or\n       article of commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 (2018). Employers have sought to use the\n       provision to exempt from antitrust scrutiny anticompetitive agreements similar to\n       the agreement alleged in the State\u2019s complaint here.\n\n\u00b6 39       In Roman v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 55 F.3d 542, 543 (10th Cir. 1995), Roman\n       alleged that several airplane manufacturers agreed not to hire each other\u2019s\n       employees. He alleged that one of the manufacturers would have hired him and\n       paid him a higher salary if not for the agreement. Id. The Roman court found that\n       Roman stated a cause of action for violation of federal antitrust law. Id. at 545. The\n       court adopted the following explanation from a treatise on antitrust law:\n\n              \u201c \u2018Antitrust law addresses employer conspiracies controlling employment\n          terms precisely because they tamper with the employment market and thereby\n          impair the opportunities of those who sell their services there. Just as antitrust\n          law seeks to preserve the free market opportunities of buyers and sellers of\n          goods, so also it seeks to do the same for buyers and sellers of employment\n          services. ***\n\n              Thus, the courts have readily approved standing for professional athletes\n          challenging agreements among employers fixing employment terms and for\n          brokers or magazine solicitors challenging their employers\u2019 agreements against\n          hiring switching employees.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 544 (quoting II Phillip Areeda & Herbert\n          Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law \u00b6 377c (rev. ed. 1995)).\n\n\u00b6 40       Both parties cite Cordova v. Bache & Co., 321 F. Supp. 600 (S.D.N.Y. 1970),\n       in support of their arguments. In Cordova, securities representatives alleged that\n       their employers, stock brokerage firms, conspired to reduce the commissions paid\n       to securities representatives for the sale of stock. Id. at 603. The brokerage firms,\n       like the staffing agencies here, argued that the complaint did not allege a violation\n       of antitrust law. Id. at 605. According to the brokerage firms, a \u201cconspiracy on the\n       part of employers with respect to the labor of their employees\u201d cannot violate\n       federal antitrust law because \u201c \u2018[t]he labor of a human being is not a commodity or\n       article of commerce.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 (1970)).\n\n\u00b6 41      The Cordova court held:\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f              \u201cIf the language of *** the Clayton Act stopped with the sentence quoted\n          by defendants, it would lend support to their position. It is immediately\n          followed, however, by additional language which when considered in the light\n          of the statute\u2019s legislative history, convinces us that the sole purpose and effect\n          of the section is to exempt activities and agreements on the part of labor,\n          agricultural or horticultural organizations with respect to their furnishing labor\n          in the market place. ***\n\n                                              ***\n\n              It is readily apparent that Congress *** was concerned with the right of\n          labor and similar organizations to continue engaging in such activities,\n          including that right to strike, not with the right of employers to ban[d] together\n          for joint action in fixing the wages to be paid by each employer. There is no\n          evidence of the existence of any necessity to protect the latter type of activity\n          ***.\u201d Id. at 605-06.\n\n\u00b6 42       The court surveyed the extensive legislative history of the federal antitrust\n       statutes and concluded:\n\n          \u201cCongress\u2019 only purpose *** was to help the labor organizations and the labor\n          movement by removing any doubt as to the legality of their existence and\n          operations. ***\n\n              ***\n\n              There can be little doubt about the fact that if a group of employers, as the\n          complaint here alleges, were allowed, not as part of a collective bargaining\n          agreement, to agree together to reduce the commissions paid to their respective\n          employees, they would have the same power to restrain competition as is\n          inherent in a price-fixing agreement. *** The effect of such a unilateral\n          agreement between employers, as alleged in the present complaint (citation),\n          could also be to restrain mobility on the part of employees who would otherwise\n          have the opportunity, in a competitive market for services, to transfer to higher\n          paid opportunities offered by other[s]. *** [A]n agreement between employers\n          would enable the employers together to achieve what no single one of them\n          could do alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f                                                ***\n\n               *** [A]n essential prerequisite to the legality of such multiemployer\n           combinations with respect to industry-wide wages or working conditions is the\n           existence or prospect of a joint collective bargaining agreement with the union,\n           which all parties concede to be immune from the antitrust laws. The exemption\n           granted to such agreements extends to joint-employer action reasonably related\n           or incident to them. Absent such conditions, however, a combination of\n           employers to reduce their employees\u2019 compensation does not share labor\u2019s\n           exemption.\u201d Id. at 606-07.\n\n\n\u00b6 43                               2. Bar Committee Comments\n\n\u00b6 44        The bar commentary explains that the Illinois Antitrust Act, \u201c[i]n the main, ***\n       is the same as a bill drafted by the Committee on Antitrust Law of the Chicago Bar\n       Association.\u201d 740 ILCS Ann. art. 10, Committee Comments-1967, at 12 (Smith-\n       Hurd 2010). The committee prepared the commentary \u201cto memorialize the\n       intentions of the draftsmen as to the meaning of the language of the Act, and to\n       offer guidance to the courts and the bar in the interpretation of the law.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 45       The commentary first explains the need for \u201ceffective antitrust enforcement at\n       the state level\u201d (id. at 13) and adds that the drafters intended \u201cto provide an effective\n       means of combating the serious damage which is done to the free enterprise system\n       in Illinois by groups who substitute self-designed schemes of private business\n       regulation for the impersonal direction of the free market\u201d (id. at 14). According to\n       the commentary, section 3(1)(a)\n\n           \u201cis designed to reach the \u2018hard core\u2019 conspiratorial offenses of price fixing,\n           limitations on production, and allocation of markets or customers. ***\n\n               Section 3(1)(a) proscribes agreements between competitors, the purpose or\n           effect of which is to fix, control, or maintain *** the prices which they will pay\n           for the commodities or services which they buy.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3, Committee\n           Comments-1967, at 19-20.\n\n\u00b6 46       The brief commentary on section 4 addresses the definition of service:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f          \u201c[T]he definitions of Section 4 were expressly designed to make services and\n          real estate subject to the prohibitions of the law. It was the feeling of the\n          draftsmen that exemptions should be strictly limited and that almost all service\n          occupations should be within the reach of the statute. In this connection see the\n          discussion, infra, with relation to Section 5 on exemptions generally.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4,\n          Committee Comments-1967, at 52.\n\n\u00b6 47      The comment on section 5 elaborates:\n\n             \u201cIt was always understood by the draftsmen that exemptions would be\n          accorded to labor unions, agricultural cooperatives, and public utilities. *** [I]t\n          was believed necessary to adopt an approach similar to that used for the federal\n          exemptions on those subjects, thereby preserving general overall consistency.\n\n              The labor exemption in subsection (1), like that of *** the Clayton Act,\n          prevents the application of the Antitrust Act to legitimate labor objectives and\n          activities of unions or of individual members thereof. The Illinois Act is more\n          explicit than the Clayton Act, however, in limiting the exemption to activities\n          which \u2018are directed solely to labor objectives which are legitimate under the\n          laws of either the State of Illinois or the United States.\u2019 ***.\n\n              The labor exemption should be read together with the provision of Section\n          4 which states that labor performed as an employee is not a \u2018service\u2019 within the\n          meaning of Section 3 of the Act. The effect of this provision is to make the Act\n          inapplicable to agreements by either labor or nonlabor groups insofar as they\n          relate to restraint of competition concerning labor itself. The Act thus protects\n          both management and labor in bargaining collectively over terms and\n          conditions of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5, Committee Comments-1967, at 55.\n\n\u00b6 48       We find the bar committee commentary shows the drafters intended to limit the\n       exemption to legitimate labor union activity and agreements multiple employers\n       reach in the course of collective negotiations with labor unions.\n\n\n\u00b6 49                                    3. Rahl\u2019s Proposal\n\n\u00b6 50       In State Antitrust, Rahl proposed an antitrust act, and the proposal included the\n       following definition:\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 14 -\n\f              \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 shall mean any activity not covered by the definition of\n          commodity, which is performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial\n          gain. \u2018Service\u2019 shall not include labor which is performed by persons as\n          employees of others, but this exclusion is limited to conduct pertaining to such\n          labor, and does not exclude from the operation of this Act agreements or acts\n          by or with laborers or organizations of laborers concerning commodities and\n          services covered by this Act.\u201d Rahl, supra, at 775.\n\n\u00b6 51      Rahl explained:\n\n          \u201cThe draft *** [makes an] exclusion for labor in the definition of \u2018services.\u2019\n          *** [The exclusion] should be sufficient to protect the right of labor\n          organizations to restrain and monopolize the terms and supply of the labor with\n          which they are concerned, and hence to carry on the customary labor activities\n          contemplated by present-day national labor policy. Incidentally, this approach\n          would also remove from the act restraints as to labor imposed by non-labor\n          groups, occurring in situations such as joint bargaining on the management\n          side.\u201d Id. at 778.\n\n\u00b6 52       Like the bar committee, Rahl emphasizes the need to exempt legitimate union\n       activity from the reach of the Illinois Antitrust Act and the correlative exemption\n       for agreements between employers in the course of negotiations with unions. No\n       source concerning the purpose of antitrust laws suggests that the legislature meant\n       to leave competing employers free to collude with each other to reduce the wages\n       they pay to their employees or to collude to prevent workers from switching to\n       better jobs.\n\n\n\u00b6 53                                 4. Legislative Inaction\n\n\u00b6 54       The staffing agencies rely on two published federal cases and argue that the\n       legislature\u2019s failure to amend the Illinois Antitrust Act after those decisions shows\n       that the two decisions correctly interpreted Illinois law.\n\n\u00b6 55       \u201cWhere the legislature chooses not to amend a statute after a judicial\n       construction, it will be presumed that it has acquiesced in the court\u2019s statement of\n       the legislative intent.\u201d Miller v. Lockett, 98 Ill. 2d 478, 483 (1983).\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f          \u201c[E]vidence of legislative silence and subsequent history is usually too\n          ambiguous to count as legislative history, but in some contexts the sources are\n          considered by the [United States Supreme] Court. *** Legislative silence will\n          usually be supporting evidence of legislative intent and will be the main\n          evidence only when there is virtually no other evidence of legislative intent.\u201d\n          Eskridge, supra, at 640.\n\n\u00b6 56       We find that the persuasive power of legislative silence depends on the\n       circumstances of the legislative decision not to amend a statute following a judicial\n       interpretation of the statute.\n\n              \u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that where, after a statute has been\n          construed by the highest court of the state, the Legislature re-enacts the statute,\n          whether by the adoption of Revised Statutes or by amendment, the act of the\n          Legislature carries with it the construction previously placed upon the law by\n          the court.\u201d Texas Fidelity & Bonding Co. v. City of Austin, 246 S.W. 1026, 1029\n          (Tex. 1922).\n\n       Similarly, \u201c[a]fter [the Illinois Supreme Court] has construed a statute, \u2018that\n       construction becomes, in effect, a part of the statute and any change in interpretation\n       can be effected by the General Assembly if it desires so to do.\u2019 \u201d Village of Vernon\n       Hills v. Heelan, 2015 IL 118170, \u00b6 19 (quoting Mitchell v. Mahin, 51 Ill. 2d 452,\n       456 (1972)).\n\n\u00b6 57       Legislative inaction following an interpretation by the Illinois Appellate Court\n       provides some lesser support for an inference the appellate court correctly\n       interpreted the statute. Barrall v. Board of Trustees of John A. Logan Community\n       College, 2020 IL 125535, \u00b6 27 n.2. The inference disappears if published opinions\n       of the appellate court give differing interpretations of the statute. See United States\n       v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 55 n.13 (1964) (no inference arises if published decisions\n       show no settled judicial interpretation of the statute).\n\n\u00b6 58        Here, the staffing agencies rely on two published federal decisions interpreting\n       Illinois law. Because the federal decisions do not bind Illinois courts (Travelers\n       Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 278, 302 (2001) (\u201c \u2018The\n       general rule is that decisions of the United States district and circuit courts are not\n       binding on Illinois courts.\u2019 \u201d (quoting City of Chicago v. Groffman, 68 Ill. 2d 112,\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f       118 (1977)))), we find the proposed inference from legislative inaction very weak,\n       but we consider it as some evidence of legislative intent. See Wittman v. Koenig,\n       831 F.3d 416, 425 (7th Cir. 2016) (\u201cIt is difficult to imagine careful drafting of\n       legislation in this field that would not consider decisions by the federal bankruptcy\n       courts in the state. In this situation, then, it is reasonable to treat legislative silence\n       as at least weak evidence that the bankruptcy courts\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin\n       Statutes \u00a7 815.18(3)(j) has not been objectionable to the legislature.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 59       In O\u2019Regan v. Arbitration Forums, Inc., 121 F.3d 1060, 1062-63 (7th Cir.\n       1997), O\u2019Regan sued her former employer, a nonprofit corporation, alleging that\n       the employer violated both federal and Illinois antitrust law by terminating her\n       employment because she refused to sign a noncompete agreement. The O\u2019Regan\n       court found O\u2019Regan had not stated a claim for a federal violation because \u201can\n       employee discharged for refusing to participate in an alleged antitrust violation has\n       no standing to sue on the basis of that violation.\u201d Id. at 1065.\n\n\u00b6 60       The court then found three separate reasons for dismissing the state claims:\n\n           \u201cFederal antitrust standing rules apply under the Illinois Antitrust Act. *** The\n           Act only covers services \u2018performed in whole or in part for the purposes of\n           financial gain.\u2019 [Citation.] *** [The defendant] is a non-profit corporation, not\n           covered by the Illinois Antitrust Act. Finally, to the extent O\u2019Regan\u2019s claims\n           relate to an alleged market for labor services, they are specifically excluded by\n           \u00a7 10\/4 of the Act ***.\u201d Id. at 1066.\n\n\u00b6 61       The O\u2019Regan court read one sentence from section 4 in isolation, without\n       considering the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole. The O\u2019Regan court did not analyze\n       section 4 in light of sections 2, 3, 5, and 11. The O\u2019Regan court did not consider\n       the purposes of the Illinois Antitrust Act or whether the court\u2019s broad reading of\n       the exemption would serve the act\u2019s purposes.\n\n\u00b6 62      The federal district court in Butler v. Jimmy John\u2019s Franchise, LLC, 331 F.\n       Supp. 3d 786, 798 (S.D. Ill. 2018) (quoting O\u2019Regan, 121 F.3d at 1066), found that\n       several competing franchisees\u2019 alleged agreement not to hire each other\u2019s\n       employees would (if proven) violate federal antitrust law, but the court followed\n       O\u2019Regan as binding precedent barring the claim for violation of the Illinois\n       Antitrust Act because the alleged agreement \u201c \u2018relate[d] to an alleged market for\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f       labor services.\u2019 \u201d Butler thus adds nothing to the slight authority of O\u2019Regan.\n\n\n\u00b6 63                     5. The Day and Temporary Labor Services Act\n\n\u00b6 64       The Staffing Services Association of Illinois and American Staffing\n       Association, in their brief amici curiae, argue that the Day and Temporary Labor\n       Services Act (Temporary Labor Act) (820 ILCS 175\/1 et seq. (West 2020))\n       comprehensively regulates all staffing agencies and therefore \u201cthe Court should\n       hold that [Temporary Labor Act]-regulated staffing agencies are implicitly\n       immunized from [Illinois Antitrust Act] liability.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 65      The Temporary Labor Act includes a statement of the problem the legislature\n       sought to address:\n\n              \u201cRecent studies and a survey of low-wage day or temporary laborers\n          themselves [find] that as a group, they are particularly vulnerable to abuse of\n          their labor rights, including unpaid wages, failure to pay for all hours worked,\n          minimum wage and overtime violations, and unlawful deductions from pay for\n          meals, transportation, equipment, and other items.\n\n              Current law is inadequate to protect the labor and employment rights of\n          these workers.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 66       The Temporary Labor Act has no provision penalizing collusion to reduce\n       wages or to limit employment opportunities for these vulnerable employees. The\n       Temporary Labor Act does not mention the Illinois Antitrust Act, nor does it\n       explicitly exempt staffing agencies from the reach of the Illinois Antitrust Act. The\n       ruling amici seek would directly conflict with the Temporary Labor Act\u2019s stated\n       purpose, and it would exacerbate the problem of worker vulnerability the legislature\n       sought to address. We find the Temporary Labor Act provides no support for the\n       staffing agencies\u2019 position.\n\n\n\u00b6 67                            6. Summary of Legislative History\n\n\u00b6 68       The Illinois Antitrust Act directs courts to look to federal case law for aid in\n       interpreting the act \u201c[w]hen the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f       a federal antitrust law.\u201d 740 ILCS 10\/11 (West 2018). This court has held that when\n       federal statutes differ from the Illinois Antitrust Act, we consider more carefully\n       whether the federal courts\u2019 reasoning helps construe the Illinois act. Gilbert\u2019s Ethan\n       Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 104. The Cordova court persuasively argues that the\n       United States Congress did not intend to exempt from antitrust scrutiny all\n       agreements between competing employers to fix wages they would pay their\n       employees and not to hire each other\u2019s employees. Cordova, 321 F. Supp. at 605-\n       07. The bar committee comments and an article by one of the proponents of the\n       Illinois Antitrust Act further support the application of Cordova\u2019s reasoning to the\n       interpretation of the Illinois Antitrust Act. Multiemployer agreements to reduce\n       wages and to reduce employment opportunities violate the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       unless the restrictions arose in the course of labor negotiations and \u201cthe affected\n       employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, *** unequivocally\n       consent[ed] to bargain with the multi-employer unit.\u201d Id. at 607. The minor\n       differences in the wording and placement of the labor exemption in the Illinois\n       Antitrust Act do not show a contrary legislative intent. The legislative inaction after\n       O\u2019Regan, which lacks precedential force in Illinois courts, does not overcome the\n       contrary inference from the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s stated purposes, the statutory\n       direction to look to federal decisions, and the discussions in the bar committee\n       comments and Rahl\u2019s article proposing terms for state antitrust statutes.\n\n\n\u00b6 69                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 70       We vacate the appellate court\u2019s answer to the question it formulated. We answer\n       the question the circuit court certified thus: the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in section 4\n       applies to the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole, but it does not exclude all\n       agreements concerning labor services from the act\u2019s coverage. In particular,\n       multiemployer agreements concerning wages they will pay their employees and\n       whether they will hire each other\u2019s employees may violate the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       unless the agreement arises as part of the bargaining process and the affected\n       employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, have sought to\n       bargain with the multiemployer unit. We do not address the second question the\n       circuit court certified (see 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 1), or the appellate court\u2019s\n       answer to that question, because the parties have not asked this court to address that\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\f       question in this appeal.\n\n\n\u00b6 71      Appellate court judgment vacated in part.\n\n\u00b6 72      Certified question answered.\n\n\u00b6 73      Cause remanded.\n\n\n\u00b6 74       JUSTICE CUNNINGHAM took no part in the consideration or decision of this\n       case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\f","                                        2024 IL 129277\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 129277)\n\n              WAUKEGAN HOSPITALITY GROUP, LLC, Appellant, v.\n           STRETCH\u2019S SPORTS BAR & GRILL CORPORATION, Appellee.\n\n\n                               Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n        JUSTICE NEVILLE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n\n        Chief Justice Theis and Justices Overstreet, Holder White, Cunningham,\n     Rochford, and O\u2019Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n\u00b61        In this case, we are asked to consider whether the appellate court had\n     jurisdiction to hear the appeal of plaintiff, Waukegan Hospitality Group, LLC,\n     where plaintiff (1) electronically filed its notice of appeal five days after it was due\n     and (2) did not file a motion seeking leave to show good cause or a reasonable\n     excuse for the late filing. The appellate court found that the plaintiff did not comply\n\f     with the supreme court rules. 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 16. We allowed\n     plaintiff\u2019s petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 315\n     (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s\n     judgment.\n\n\n\u00b62                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On September 1, 2020, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint in Lake County\n     circuit court for eviction against defendant, Stretch\u2019s Sports Bar & Grill\n     Corporation. Count I sought possession, and count II sought a money judgment. On\n     March 1, 2021, after plaintiff presented its case at a bench trial, on defendant\u2019s\n     motion the trial court found against plaintiff and entered judgment in favor of\n     defendant. See 735 ILCS 5\/2-1110 (West 2020). On March 2, 2021, the court\n     entered a written order memorializing its judgment. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal\n     on April 6, 2021.\n\n\u00b64       The appellate court first addressed its jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n     2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 7. The court determined that the final judgment date\n     was March 2, 2021, which made plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal due on or before April\n     1, 2021. Id. \u00b6 10. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was file-stamped on April 6, 2021. Id.\n     \u00b6 11. The court noted plaintiff\u2019s assertions that it had electronically submitted the\n     notice of appeal on April 1, 2021, that the clerk rejected the notice of appeal on\n     April 6, 2021, and that plaintiff resubmitted the notice of appeal on the same day.\n     Id. \u00b6 12. The court found the first two factual assertions were not supported by the\n     record. Id. Nonetheless, the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s arguments and would have\n     made the same decision even if it assumed each factual assertion were true. Id.\n\n\u00b65        The court described two potential avenues for relief where a clerk\u2019s rejection of\n     a notice of appeal renders the document untimely\u2014(1) relief can be obtained in the\n     circuit court under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022), or (2)\n     relief can be obtained in the appellate court pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule\n     303(d) (eff. July 1, 2017). 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Ultimately, the court\n     did not decide which rule was the \u201cproper vehicle to excuse a late electronic filing\n     of a notice of appeal *** because plaintiff did not seek relief under either.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16.\n     The court held that jurisdiction was lacking and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s appeal. Id.\n     \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f\u00b66         This court granted plaintiff\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct.

ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiff again argues that its notice of appeal was filed timely because it\n       electronically submitted the notice of appeal before midnight on the due date, April\n       1, 2021. Plaintiff invokes due process concerns and argues that it should not be\n       penalized where the clerk erroneously rejected its notice of appeal. Finally, plaintiff\n       recommends that this court \u201cconsider ordering the clerks of this State discontinue\n       the process of outright rejecting motions to reconsider and notices of appeal when\n       a non-material defect is recognized in the electronic filing.\u201d For the following\n       reasons, we reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments.\n\n\n\u00b69                     A. Proceeding With Review on Plaintiff\u2019s Brief Alone\n\n\u00b6 10       Defendant did not file a brief in this court. However, our review is not hindered\n       because the record is simple and the issue is one that the court can easily decide on\n       plaintiff\u2019s brief alone. See First Capitol Mortgage Corp. v. Talandis Construction\n       Corp., 63 Ill. 2d 128, 133 (1976). Thus, following Talandis, we find support for our\n       decision to address the merits of this appeal. See McHenry Township v. County of\n       McHenry, 2022 IL 127258, \u00b6 48.\n\n\n\u00b6 11                                   B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 12       \u201cThe determination of whether the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider\n       an appeal is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d People v. Vara, 2018 IL\n       121823, \u00b6 12. The construction of our rules is also a question of law subject to\n       de novo review. People v. Casler, 2020 IL 125117, \u00b6 22.\n\n\n\u00b6 13                   C. Supreme Court Rules Governing Notices of Appeal\n\n\u00b6 14        \u201cEvery final judgment of a circuit court in a civil case is appealable as of right.\u201d\n       Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). \u201cThe appeal is initiated by filing a notice of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f       appeal.\u201d Id. \u201cNo other step is jurisdictional.\u201d Id. \u201cThe notice of appeal must be filed\n       with the clerk of the circuit court within 30 days after the entry of the final judgment\n       appealed from ***.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(a)(1) (eff. July 1, 2017). The notice of appeal\n       in a civil case \u201cshall be electronically filed with the clerk of court.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R.\n       9(a) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022). Rule 9(d) provides: \u201cUnless a statute, rule, or court order\n       requires that a document be filed by a certain time of day, a document is considered\n       timely if submitted before midnight (in the court\u2019s time zone) on or before the date\n       on which the document is due.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022).\n\n\u00b6 15       A document is untimely if it is rejected by the clerk and not timely resubmitted\n       and accepted. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022); Davis v. Village of\n       Maywood, 2020 IL App (1st) 191011, \u00b6 19 (holding that a rejected submission has\n       \u201cno effect\u201d). In that event, our rules provide two potential avenues of relief. First,\n       Rule 9(d)(2) provides that, \u201c[i]f a document is rejected by the clerk and is therefore\n       untimely, the filing party may seek appropriate relief from the court, upon good\n       cause shown.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022). 1 The circuit court is vested\n       with \u201csound discretion\u201d in determining whether \u201cgood cause\u201d has been shown. See\n       Vision Point of Sale, Inc. v. Haas, 226 Ill. 2d 334, 353 (2007) (holding that \u201cwhat\n       constitutes good cause,\u201d in the context of a motion for extension of time, \u201cis fact-\n       dependent and rests within the sound discretion of the circuit court\u201d); see also\n       Kilpatrick v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 2023 IL App (2d) 230088, \u00b6 15 (holding\n       that a circuit court\u2019s ruling on a litigant\u2019s Rule 9(d)(2) motion is reviewed for an\n       abuse of discretion).\n\n\u00b6 16       Second, Rule 303(d) is another potential avenue for relief and permits a litigant\n       to take its case directly to the appellate court. Rule 303(d) provides that \u201cthe\n       reviewing court may grant leave to appeal\u201d on \u201cmotion supported by a showing of\n       reasonable excuse for failure to file a notice of appeal on time, accompanied by the\n\n            1\n              We note that there is disagreement in the appellate court on whether Rule 9(d)(2) can be used\n       to establish jurisdiction when a notice of appeal is not timely filed. Compare O\u2019Gara v. O\u2019Gara,\n       2022 IL App (1st) 210013, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47 (holding that a trial court could rule on a Rule 9(d)(2) motion\n       after 30 days from the entry of a final judgment, as a nunc pro tunc order, if the document was\n       electronically submitted within the 30-day limitation period), with 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 15\n       (noting that the \u201cprocedure to seek relief under Rule 9(d)(2) may not apply to a notice of appeal\n       because (1) a trial court loses its jurisdiction 30 days after final judgment, and (2) the rule does not\n       state that a trial court retains jurisdiction to grant such relief\u201d). We need not decide the availability\n       of relief under Rule 9(d)(2) in this case because plaintiff never sought such relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\f       proposed notice of appeal and the filing fee, filed in the reviewing court within 30\n       days after expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(d)\n       (eff. July 1, 2017). We have found \u201creasonable excuse\u201d where an attorney made an\n       \u201chonest mistake\u201d in recording the incorrect date for the final judgment and,\n       immediately upon discovering the error, \u201cmade every effort to rectify the situation.\u201d\n       Bank of Herrin v. Peoples Bank of Marion, 105 Ill. 2d 305, 308-09 (1985).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                      D. Plaintiff Failed to Comply With Our Rules\n\n\u00b6 18        It is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 6, 2021, five\n       days after it was due. It is also undisputed that plaintiff did not seek relief in the\n       circuit court under Rule 9(d)(2) or in the appellate court under Rule 303(d).\n       Nonetheless, plaintiff relies on two facts to argue that the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction: (1) that it submitted a notice of appeal electronically on April 1, 2021,\n       and (2) that the clerk erroneously rejected the notice of appeal. We find plaintiff\u2019s\n       arguments unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the record does not support either of\n       plaintiff\u2019s factual assertions. Second, under our rules, plaintiff was required to have\n       its untimely filing excused by a court.\n\n\n\u00b6 19                                   1. Incomplete Record\n\n\u00b6 20       The appellant has the burden of presenting a sufficiently complete record to\n       support a claim of error. Midstate Siding & Window Co. v. Rogers, 204 Ill. 2d 314,\n       319 (2003) (citing Foutch v. O\u2019Bryant, 99 Ill. 2d 389, 391-92 (1984)). \u201cA party\n       may generally not rely on matters outside the record to support its position on\n       appeal.\u201d Keener v. City of Herrin, 235 Ill. 2d 338, 346 (2009). If pleadings, exhibits,\n       or other materials are not in the record, they may not be placed before a reviewing\n       court in an appendix. Ill. S. Ct. R. 342 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019) (providing that the\n       appendix to an appellant\u2019s brief is limited to pleadings, exhibits, or other materials\n       \u201cfrom the record\u201d); Oruta v. B.E.W., 2016 IL App (1st) 152735, \u00b6 32 (explaining\n       that materials improperly placed in an appendix will be disregarded).\n\n\u00b6 21       The documents alleged to support plaintiff\u2019s factual assertions are not in the\n       record. Instead, they are in the appendix to its appellant\u2019s brief. Plaintiff\u2019s appendix\n       includes, inter alia, documents titled \u201cNotice of Appeal Filed April 1, 2021\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information.\u201d Plaintiff labels each document as a supplemental\n       record exhibit. The \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information\u201d consists of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, which indicates that the April 1 filing was the notice of appeal with the\n       trial court\u2019s order included as an attachment. Based on these exhibits, plaintiff\n       maintains that its April 1 filing was \u201cRejected\u201d and that the clerk\u2019s explanation was\n       that there \u201cshould not be any attachments.\u201d The clerk directed plaintiff to \u201cresubmit\n       with all pages as one lead document.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the clerk\u2019s reason for\n       rejection was \u201cin contravention of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit\u2019s specific rule\n       requiring litigants to upload documents separately and expressly forbidding filers\n       from combining multiple documents into one PDF.\u201d See 19th Judicial Cir. Ct. R.\n       1-2.08(E) (Dec. 31, 2017) (\u201cBulk filings of multiple cases or multiple documents\n       combined into one PDF document shall not be accepted.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 22       Because the documents or exhibits are only found in the appendix, the facts and\n       inferences flowing from the documents or exhibits are not within the record. The\n       documents or exhibits were also not presented to the appellate court. In short,\n       evidence of plaintiff\u2019s assertions\u2014that it timely submitted its notice of appeal\n       electronically and that the clerk erroneously rejected the electronic filing\u2014is not\n       found in the common-law record. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 321 (eff. Oct. 1, 2021)\n       (\u201cContents of the Record on Appeal\u201d\u2014\u201cThe common law record includes every\n       document filed, judgment, and order entered and any exhibit offered and filed by\n       any party.\u201d). As will be discussed more fully below, plaintiff never filed a motion\n       in either the circuit or appellate court to challenge the propriety of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, and thus, the supporting documents were never made part of the record.\n       As a result, there is no basis in the record to find that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal\n       was timely.\n\n\n\u00b6 23                   2. Plaintiff Failed to Seek Recourse for Its Untimely Filing\n\n\u00b6 24        Because plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, plaintiff was required to seek\n       relief. Plaintiff did not do so. That fact is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s claim that the appellate\n       court had jurisdiction. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on due process concerns is misplaced\n       because plaintiff did not utilize the remedies available. See Alvin v. Suzuki, 227\n       F.3d 107, 116 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[A] procedural due process violation cannot have\n       occurred when the governmental actor provides apparently adequate procedural\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f       remedies and the plaintiff has not availed himself of those remedies.\u201d). As\n       discussed above, two of our rules provide potential recourse for a litigant who has\n       an initial submission rejected by the clerk. Taking plaintiff\u2019s premise as true, that\n       the clerk erroneously applied local rules in rejecting his initial submission, one\n       would be hard-pressed to find a more compelling case of \u201cgood cause\u201d or\n       \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to allow plaintiff\u2019s appeal to proceed. However, plaintiff never\n       sought to establish that premise in either the circuit or appellate court. Because\n       plaintiff did not seek to excuse its untimely filing, it is left with the fact that its\n       notice of appeal was filed five days after the due date. The legal effect of that fact\n       is that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n\n\n\u00b6 25                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 26       Under our rules, when the clerk\u2019s rejection of a litigant\u2019s electronically filed\n       notice of appeal causes it to be untimely, the litigant must invoke the Illinois\n       Supreme Court rules to seek recourse. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely,\n       and plaintiff did not seek recourse in our rules. Accordingly, the appellate court was\n       correct that it lacked jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u00b6 27      Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 28      Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f","Court of Appeals\nof the State of Georgia\n\n                                                               ATLANTA, January 19, 2024\n\nThe Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order\n\nA24I0102.

Mosaic\n\nII, at 1369\u201371.\n\n       Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, Commerce issued supplemental questionnaires to the\n\nmandatory respondents.

The court remanded to Commerce to further explain\n\nwhy it chose profit before tax, rather than gross profit, in its profit ratio calculation.2 Mosaic II, at\n\n1371 (\u201cCommerce did not proffer why Profit Before Tax was used in previous proceedings or\n\nexplain why it produced an accurate result now.\u201d).

Alternatively, if Commerce persists\n\nin its chosen methodology, PhosAgro argues for the inclusion of additional expenses that \u201care\n\nnecessary in order to ensure a reasonable comparison of the alleged benefit [it received].\u201d Id. at\n\n12. The Government supports Commerce\u2019s use of profit before tax and decision not to adjust for\n\nany additional expenses that \u201cwould compromise the profit ratio calculation and incorporate\n\nexpenses unrelated to mining and beneficiation activities.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. in Supp. of Remand\n\nResults at 19, ECF No. 142 (Dec. 13, 2023) (\u201cDef.

On remand,\n\nCommerce further explained its decision to use profit before tax here. As Commerce explains,\n\nprofit before tax is narrower and helps to isolate costs for phosphate ore mining and beneficiation\n\nactivities. Redetermination Results at 19\u201325. Conversely, using a gross profit calculation would\n\ninclude costs unrelated to the mining of phosphate ore such as selling and administrative expenses,\n\ntaxes other than income taxes, and \u201cother\u201d expenses. Id. at 17.\n\n       PhosAgro has failed to demonstrate that including expenses broader than those involved in\n\nthe mining and beneficiation of phosphate ore would bolster Commerce\u2019s goal to render an\n\naccurate profit ratio.

The Commission\ndismissed the first complaint on the ground of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, and it dismissed the second after concluding the\nrecord provided no \u201creason to believe\u201d the alleged violation\noccurred. End Citizens United PAC filed suit, challenging both\ndismissals. The district court dismissed the suit, and we affirm.\nThe Commission\u2019s first dismissal is unreviewable because it\nwas based on prosecutorial discretion, and the second dismissal\nwas not contrary to law.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n     New Republican is a \u201cSuper PAC,\u201d meaning a political\naction committee \u201cthat makes only independent expenditures\nand cannot contribute to candidates.\u201d See McCutcheon v. FEC,\n572 U.S. 185, 193 n.2 (2014) (plurality opinion). Rick Scott\nbecame New Republican\u2019s chairman in May 2017 and formally\nstepped down in December 2017. He officially declared his run\nfor Senate in April 2018.\n\f                                 3\n     End Citizens United filed two administrative complaints\nwith the Commission, alleging New Republican and Scott1\nviolated several requirements of the Federal Election\nCampaign Act of 1971 (\u201cFECA\u201d). See Pub. L. No. 92-225, 86\nStat. 3 (codified as amended at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101 et seq.).\nAccording to End Citizens United, before officially declaring\nhis Senate run, Scott began informal campaign activities and\nused New Republican\u2019s resources to support his nascent\ncandidacy. He also allegedly continued to exert control over\nNew Republican into 2018\u2014well after his chairmanship\nended. He purportedly did this by fundraising for New\nRepublican, participating in conference calls, and interacting\nwith political allies connected to the PAC, among other things.\nImmediately after Scott officially declared his candidacy in\nApril 2018, New Republican revamped its website and issued\na press release to announce its \u201cfocus[] on the election of Rick\nScott in the race for Florida United States Senate.\u201d\n\n     Based on this timeline, End Citizens United\u2019s first\ncomplaint maintained that Scott became a \u201ccandidate\u201d in May\n2017, the same month he became chairman of New\nRepublican, and that he failed to register his campaign until\nnearly a year later. Complaint at 1\u20135, FEC Matter Under\nReview 7370 (\u201cComplaint One\u201d) (Apr. 23, 2018); see also 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30101(2) (defining \u201ccandidate\u201d); 11 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 100.72(a) (outlining permissible activities and reporting\nrequirements for individuals \u201cdetermining whether \u2026 [to]\nbecome a candidate\u201d). As a consequence of the alleged failure\nto timely register his campaign, Scott failed to make the\nnecessary filings and reports to the FEC. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 30102\u201304. The complaint also alleged that New Republican\n\n1\n End Citizens United also alleged Scott\u2019s campaign had violated\nFECA. For purposes of this case, we do not distinguish between\nScott and his campaign because the distinction is not relevant here.\n\f                               4\nunlawfully raised and spent funds while under Scott\u2019s control,\nbecause all candidate controlled entities are subject \u201cto\n[FECA\u2019s]      limitations,   prohibitions,  and     reporting\nrequirements.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30125(e)(1)(A).\n\n     The second complaint alleged unlawful coordination\nbetween Scott and New Republican. Complaint at 1\u20138, FEC\nMatter Under Review 7496 (\u201cComplaint Two\u201d) (Sept. 14,\n2018). New Republican launched two television commercials,\nin May and June 2018, against Scott\u2019s opponent in the Senate\nrace. End Citizens United alleged that New Republican had\nimpermissibly contributed to Scott\u2019s campaign by coordinating\nwith Scott to purchase the commercials. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30116(a)(7)(B)(i), (f) (specifying that, when a Super PAC\nmakes an expenditure \u201cin cooperation, consultation, or\nconcert[] with\u201d a candidate, that expenditure \u201cshall be\nconsidered\u201d an impermissible contribution even if the Super\nPAC never transferred funds directly to the candidate); see also\n11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21 (defining \u201ccoordinated communication\u201d).\nIn support of this claim, End Citizens United emphasized that\nScott had continued his involvement with New Republican for\nmonths after formally stepping down, including during the\nperiod when the advertisements were booked and paid for.\nScott and New Republican denied the allegations in both\ncomplaints.\n\n                              B.\n\n     After reviewing the complaints and responses, the\nCommission\u2019s general counsel recommended the Commission\nfind \u201creason to believe\u201d Scott and New Republican committed\nsome of the Complaint One violations. See 11 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 111.7(a). With respect to the Complaint Two coordination\nclaim, the general counsel relied on the sworn statement of\nBlaise Hazelwood, who took over New Republican after\n\f                               5\nScott\u2019s departure. Hazelwood stated that she had directed the\nadvertisement placements without coordinating with Scott or\nhis campaign. The general counsel noted that End Citizens\nUnited\u2019s complaint almost exclusively relied on the timing of\nthe campaign commercials, inferring coordination from the fact\nthat the commercials aired shortly after Scott stepped down\nfrom New Republican and formally announced his candidacy.\nAside from this \u201cmere temporal relationship,\u201d however, the\ngeneral counsel concluded there was \u201cno information available\nsuggesting\u201d coordination had occurred. The general counsel\nrecommended the Commission take no action on Complaint\nTwo and wait to see whether the recommended investigation\ninto Complaint One uncovered facts that would provide reason\nto believe New Republican had unlawfully coordinated with\nScott.\n\n     Under FECA, the Commission will begin an investigation\nonly if four commissioners determine there is \u201creason to\nbelieve\u201d a violation has occurred. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2).\n\u201c[A]n affirmative vote of four commissioners is required for\nthe agency to initiate enforcement proceedings.\u201d Citizens for\nResp. & Ethics in Wash. v.

See Combat Veterans for Cong. PAC v. FEC, 795\nF.3d 151, 153 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Here, three commissioners\nvoted to find reason to believe the violations had occurred, and\nthe other three voted to dismiss both complaints. Lacking the\nfour votes necessary to begin an investigation, the Commission\nvoted five to one to close the file and dismiss the complaints.\n\n    The three commissioners voting against enforcement, the\nso-called controlling commissioners, issued a Statement of\n\f                                 6\nReasons.2 Statement of Reasons of Vice Chair Allen Dickerson\nand Commissioners Sean J.

With respect to\nComplaint One, they offered legal and evidentiary grounds for\ndismissal. They also explicitly \u201cinvoked \u2026 prosecutorial\ndiscretion pursuant to Heckler v. Chaney,\u201d concluding it would\nbe unwise to \u201cauthoriz[e] an expensive and resource-\nconsuming investigation while the Commission is \u2026 working\nthrough a substantial backlog of cases.\u201d Id. at 10 (citing\nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985)). As to Complaint\nTwo, the controlling commissioners offered two independent\nreasons for dismissal. First, they suggested the coordination\nallegation could not go forward without \u201ca threshold finding\u201d\nthat Scott or New Republican had violated FECA\u2019s campaign\nregistration, filing, reporting, or spending requirements, as\nalleged in Complaint One. Id. at 2 n.2. Second, they\nincorporated by reference the general counsel\u2019s evidentiary\nanalysis, agreeing the record did not support a reason to believe\ncoordination had occurred. Id. at 5 n.25.\n\n     End Citizens United filed suit in 2021, challenging the\nCommission\u2019s dismissals as \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). The Commission did not defend its\ndismissals in district court. After allowing New Republican to\nintervene as a defendant, the district court granted summary\njudgment in New Republican\u2019s favor. End Citizens United\n\n2\n   The commissioners voting against enforcement are called\n\u201ccontrolling [c]ommissioners,\u201d and their stated reasons are \u201ctreated\nas if they were expressing the Commission\u2019s rationale for dismissal.\u201d\nNew Models, 993 F.3d at 883 n.3 (cleaned up); see also Democratic\nCong.

Dissenting Op. 13\u201314. This splicing\nof the Statement of Reasons fails for multiple reasons. To begin with,\nEnd Citizens United did not raise this argument on appeal and\nrepeatedly recognizes that the controlling commissioners relied on\nprosecutorial discretion to dismiss the first complaint. See, e.g.,\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5. \u201c[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues\nfor decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters\nthe parties present.\u201d United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct.\n1575, 1579 (2020) (cleaned up).\n     In any event, on the merits, the dissent\u2019s interpretation misreads\nthe Statement of Reasons. When concluding the Statement, the\ncontrolling commissioners explicitly state, \u201c[u]ltimately, we\ndetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of our\nprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 10. And, contrary\nto the dissent, \u201cthis Matter\u201d was previously defined to include \u201cthe\ncomplaints received by the Commission on April 23, 2018,\u201d id. at 2\n(emphasis added), which is all of Complaint One, not just the \u201cfiling\u201d\nclaims. Moreover, the Statement does not clearly separate its analysis\nof the \u201csoft money\u201d claims and the \u201cfiling\u201d claims. Rather, the\ncontrolling commissioners explain the claims are inextricably\nconnected because \u201c[u]nder [FECA], New Republican can commit a\nsoft money violation only if Scott is a candidate. But if Scott was not\na candidate, then there can be no soft money violation.\u201d Id. at 7. The\ndiscussion of the \u201csoft money\u201d issue was predicated on \u201cassuming\narguendo that Scott had become a candidate at some point prior to\nhis formal announcement.\u201d Id. But on that threshold question, and\ntherefore with respect to all the claims in \u201cthis Matter,\u201d the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked prosecutorial discretion.\n\f                                12\ndecisions that turn even in part on legal interpretation. But the\nanalysis in the Statement of Reasons, which discussed legal\nreasons as well as prosecutorial discretion, cannot be\ndistinguished from the statement we found unreviewable in\nNew Models. That statement, like the one at issue here,\n\u201cprovided legal reasons \u2026 for declining enforcement\u201d in\naddition to invoking prosecutorial discretion. New Models, 993\nF.3d at 885\u201386. There are no grounds for distinguishing the two\ncases, so we cannot review the dismissal.\n\n     End Citizens United also explicitly asks us to depart from\nCommission on Hope and New Models because they conflict\nwith earlier decisions. We addressed the same argument at\nlength in New Models, explaining why that decision was\nconsistent with the text and structure of FECA, as well as with\nthe cases on which End Citizens United now relies.

This means, of course, that three commissioners may\nblock the investigation and enforcement of a complaint.6\nUnable to abide the \u201cCommission\u2019s passivity,\u201d the dissent\nenvisions a dynamic role for the courts to encourage, prompt,\nand prise open the courthouse doors to the enforcement of\ncampaign finance laws.

The dissent agrees that Commission deadlocks are reviewable,\nand nothing in our caselaw suggests we must turn a blind eye to the\ninvocation of prosecutorial discretion in a deadlock dismissal.\n\f                               14\ndismissal or failure to act is \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). As we have long recognized, the\nCommission, \u201cnot a court of review,\u201d must \u201cserve as the\nprimary decisionmaker in the area Congress has\ncommitted \u2026 to the FEC\u2019s charge.\u201d Democratic Cong.\nCampaign Comm., 831 F.2d at 1133; see also FEC v.\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37\n(1981) (explaining the Commission has the \u201csole discretionary\npower to determine in the first instance whether or not a civil\nviolation of [FECA] has occurred\u201d) (cleaned up). When the\nCommission cannot garner four votes for an investigation, and\ndismissal of the complaint turns on prosecutorial discretion,\nthere is simply no legal reasoning to review. FECA does not\nconfer on the courts a general power to enforce the law, which\ninstead belongs to the Commission in the exercise of its\nexecutive power.\n\n     Although the district court correctly held the dismissal of\nComplaint One was not reviewable because the Commission\u2019s\ndecision rested in part on prosecutorial discretion, the court\nmistakenly characterized this as a jurisdictional issue. The non-\nreviewability of prosecutorial discretion under Chaney is not\njurisdictional; rather, it deprives the plaintiff of a cause of\naction. Oryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, 524\u201326 (D.C.

Without\nany reliance on prosecutorial discretion, the controlling\ncommissioners offered two legal determinations to support the\ndismissal, and we review these conclusions under the contrary\nto law standard. The first reason for dismissal was that if none\n\f                                  15\nof the \u201cthreshold\u201d violations alleged in Complaint One had\noccurred, then illegal coordination (as alleged in Complaint\nTwo) also could not have occurred as a matter of law.\nStatement of Reasons at 2 n.2. That was \u201ca legal determination\nnot committed to the agency\u2019s unreviewable discretion.\u201d New\nModels, 993 F.3d at 884\u201385 (cleaned up). The second reason\nfor dismissal was that there was not enough evidence to find\nreason to believe a violation of FECA had occurred. Statement\nof Reasons at 5 n.25.\n\n     Assessing whether certain acts constitute FECA violations\nand whether the facts in the record provide reason to believe a\nviolation occurred are treated as judicially reviewable under the\ncontrary to law standard.7 See Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242\u201344\n(reviewing the FEC\u2019s determination that there was insufficient\nevidence for a reason to believe finding); Orloski, 795 F.2d at\n167 (same).\n\n     Under our precedents, a dismissal is contrary to law if it\nmisinterprets the statute, is arbitrary or capricious, or is an\nabuse of discretion. See, e.g., Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242. This\nreview is \u201cextremely deferential\u201d when the Commission finds\nno reason to believe a violation has occurred. Orloski, 795 F.2d\nat 167; see Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242 (rejecting the argument\nthat \u201ca less deferential standard of review\u201d applies to reason to\nbelieve dismissals and observing \u201cwe have held just the\n\n7\n  We reject New Republican\u2019s suggestion in passing that\u2014because\nthe first complaint was dismissed on the basis of prosecutorial\ndiscretion\u2014the dismissal of the second complaint is also\nunreviewable. Enforcement discretion not to pursue one complaint\ndoes not necessarily apply to another complaint, even when multiple\ndismissals are explained in a single statement of reasons. See 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C) (\u201cIn any proceeding under this paragraph\nthe court may declare that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure\nto act is contrary to law.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\f                               16\nopposite\u201d). Commission dismissals at the reason to believe\nstage are highly context specific and involve detailed\nconsideration of the record, so we will not lightly disturb them.\n\n                               2.\n\n     The controlling commissioners found no reason to believe\nthere was a violation of FECA and, therefore, declined to\ninvestigate the allegations made in Complaint Two. The\ncontrolling commissioners based their dismissal on the general\ncounsel\u2019s report, which \u201ccustomarily provides the basis for [the\nCommission\u2019s] action\u201d for purposes of judicial review.\nHagelin, 411 F.3d at 239 (cleaned up). The report referred to\nHazelwood\u2019s sworn assertion that, as the new chairwoman of\nNew Republican, she had placed the television advertisements\nwithout coordinating with Scott or his campaign. That\nconclusion comported with the record, especially given\nComplaint Two\u2019s heavy reliance on the \u201cmere temporal\nrelationship\u201d between Scott\u2019s leaving New Republican and the\nplacement of the commercials. The general counsel also\npointed to the lack of other evidence suggesting coordination.\nAt this threshold stage, the Commission was voting on whether\nto begin an investigation, and \u201c[b]efore it may act, the\nCommission must find \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that a violation of\n[FECA] has occurred.\u201d Combat Veterans, 795 F.3d at 153\n(quoting 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2)). Relying on the record and\nthe determinations of the general counsel, the controlling\ncommissioners reasonably dismissed Complaint Two.\n\n     End Citizens United raises various objections, primarily\nattempting to show the dismissal of Complaint Two was\ncontrary to law because it was inadequately reasoned. End\nCitizens United first suggests the controlling commissioners\nshould have offered a more detailed explanation rather than\nrelying on the general counsel\u2019s findings. But where the\n\f                              17\ncontrolling commissioners\u2019 \u201creliance on the General Counsel\u2019s\nrecommendation and analysis of the relevant statutory\nprovisions [is] sufficiently reasonable to be accepted,\u201d this\ncourt \u201cwill not disturb their decision.\u201d Democracy 21, 952 F.3d\nat 358 (cleaned up). Second, End Citizens United notes the\ngeneral counsel doubted Hazelwood\u2019s credibility on some\npoints. These concerns, however, do not undermine the fact\nthat the general counsel did not doubt Hazelwood\u2019s statements\nabout the television advertisements that were the subject of the\ncoordination claim. And the controlling commissioners\nreasonably concluded the credibility of Hazelwood\u2019s\nstatements was bolstered by the fact she made them under\npenalty of perjury.\n\n     Third, End Citizens United points out the general\ncounsel\u2019s ultimate recommendation was to defer action on the\nsecond complaint rather than dismissing it outright. But the\ngeneral counsel also concluded there was insufficient evidence\nto support a reason to believe finding for the second complaint.\nThe general counsel\u2019s additional recommendation to defer\naction assumed the Commission would investigate the first\ncomplaint allegations, which might, in turn, uncover evidence\nof unlawful coordination. But the controlling commissioners\ncorrectly recognized that their dismissal of the first complaint\nforeclosed any further investigation, which meant no additional\nfacts would come to light. And as already discussed, the record\ndid not otherwise provide reason to believe a coordination\nviolation occurred. The controlling commissioners accordingly\nvoted to dismiss for insufficient evidence. That was both\nreasonable and lawful.\n\n     Finally, End Citizens United presses a more conventional\ncontrary to law challenge, faulting the controlling\ncommissioners for their apparent view that a coordination\nviolation was impossible as a matter of law unless at least one\n\f                                  18\n\u201cthreshold\u201d Complaint One violation also occurred. We need\nnot address this parallel reason for dismissal. Even if the\ncontrolling commissioners were wrong to treat a Complaint\nOne violation as a threshold issue, End Citizens United has not\ncarried its \u201cburden to demonstrate prejudicial error.\u201d Jicarilla\nApache Nation v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 613 F.3d 1112, 1121\n(D.C. Cir. 2010). The APA directs courts to take \u201cdue\naccount \u2026 of the rule of prejudicial error,\u201d and that principle\napplies in this context. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; Comm\u2019n on Hope, 892\nF.3d at 437 (explaining the APA continues to apply absent a\nclear statement to the contrary). \u201c[W]hen an agency relies on\nmultiple grounds for its decision, some of which are invalid,\nwe may nonetheless sustain the decision as long as one is valid\nand the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if\nthe other were unavailable.\u201d8 Bally\u2019s Park Place, Inc. v. NLRB,\n646 F.3d 929, 939 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (cleaned up).\n\n    As already discussed, the three controlling commissioners\ndetermined there was no reason to believe impermissible\ncoordination had occurred. With a deadlocked Commission\nand short of the four votes necessary for an investigation,\ndismissal was required under FECA. See Combat Veterans,\n795 F.3d at 153; see also Public Citizen, Inc. v. FERC, 839 F.3d\n1165, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (explaining that, unlike in the\ncontext of FERC deadlocks, FECA \u201ccompels [the] FEC to\ndismiss complaints in deadlock situations\u201d).\n\n\n8\n  End Citizens United also asserts the controlling commissioners\u2019\nevidentiary conclusion cannot have been an independent basis for\ndismissal because their discussion cross-referenced the discussion\nabout \u201cthreshold\u201d violations. But the failure to find reason to believe\nwas sufficient for dismissal as a matter of law, and a mere cross-\nreference does not change that conclusion. See Combat Veterans,\n795 F.3d at 153. Nothing in the Statement of Reasons suggests the\ncontrolling commissioners thought otherwise.\n\f                             19\n     While the dismissal of Complaint Two is reviewable, End\nCitizens United has failed to show the dismissal was contrary\nto law. The controlling commissioners reasonably credited the\ngeneral counsel\u2019s careful evidentiary determinations and\nconcluded the record provided no reason to believe a violation\nhad occurred.\n\n                            ***\n\n    The Commission\u2019s dismissal of Complaint One was an\nunreviewable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The\ndismissal of Complaint Two was reviewable, and the district\ncourt correctly held the Commission\u2019s dismissal was not\ncontrary to law. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s\njudgment as modified.\n\n                                                  So ordered.\n\f     PILLARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:    The Federal Election Commission (FEC or\nCommission) dismissed two complaints. I agree with the\nmajority that the Commission\u2019s dismissal of the second\ncomplaint is reviewable and that it was not contrary to law.\nAccordingly, I join Part II.B. of the majority opinion. I dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s ruling that an invocation of enforcement\ndiscretion by a non-majority of commissioners as to certain\nclaims in the first complaint prevents us from reviewing that\ncomplaint. Even if I agreed that such a non-majority statement\nbarred judicial review, I would dissent from the court\u2019s\ndecision to apply that bar more broadly than did the\ncommissioners themselves.\n\n     Congress passed the Federal Elections Campaign Act\n(FECA) to address corrosive influences of money in politics.\nResponsive to the distinctive challenges of regulating political\nactivity, FECA is unique among federal laws in three important\nways. First, to prevent partisan domination, the law\u2019s primary\nenforcer\u2014the six-member Commission\u2014has no partisan\nmajority or chair and cannot officially take enforcement actions\nwithout a bipartisan majority. Second, to avoid nullification of\nFECA by a non-majority bloc of commissioners refusing to act\non apparent violations of campaign-finance laws, Congress\nmade such refusals to act\u2014no matter the reason\u2014reviewable\nin court. If a court holds that the allegations or evidence before\nthe FEC present a legally tenable claim, the Commission gets\nanother chance to enforce. Recognizing that the Commission\nmight still deadlock, FECA includes a third distinctive feature,\navailable only if the Commission fails to move forward: a\nprivate right of action to take up the case independent of FEC\nresources or initiative.\n\n     Five years ago, a divided panel of this court in Citizens for\nResp. & Ethics in Washington v. FEC (Commission on Hope\nI), 892 F.3d 434 (D.C. Cir. 2018), upended this carefully\ncrafted statutory scheme. Embracing a position that no party\n\f                              2\nhad even briefed and that the FEC disclaimed, the court held\nthat Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), enables a non-\nmajority bloc of commissioners to shield nonenforcement\ndecisions from judicial review, and thereby extinguish the\nprivate right of action, just by invoking the words\n\u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Three years later, another divided\npanel embraced that misguided decision. Citizens for Resp. &\nEthics in Wash. v. FEC (New Models I), 993 F.3d 880, 882\n(D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\n     I have explained elsewhere why those rulings conflict with\nFECA\u2019s terms, structure, and purpose; with the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998); and with\nour decisions in Chamber of Commerce v. FEC, 69 F.3d 600\n(D.C. Cir. 1995), Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee v. FEC (DCCC), 831 F.2d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1987),\nand Orloski v. FEC, 795 F.2d 156 (D.C. Cir. 1986). See\nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC (Commission on\nHope II), 923 F.3d 1141, 1145 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Pillard, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also\nCommission on Hope I, 892 F.3d at 442-46 (Pillard, J.,\ndissenting). My colleagues have voiced similar concerns. See\nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC (New Models II),\n55 F.4th 918, 922-32 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (Millett, J., dissenting\nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc); New Models I, 993 F.3d\nat 895-906 (Millett, J., dissenting); Campaign Legal Ctr. &\nDemocracy 21 v. FEC, 952 F.3d 352, 358-63 (D.C. Cir. 2020)\n(Edwards, J., concurring); Commission on Hope II, 923 F.3d at\n1142 (Griffith, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en\nbanc).\n\n     Since our court\u2019s wrong turn in applying Heckler to\neffectively scuttle FECA\u2019s enforcement mechanism, partisan\nblocs of commissioners have taken advantage of the error.\nThey have routinely cited \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to stymie\n\f                               3\njudicial scrutiny of apparently serious FECA violations, evade\nthe stimulus to move forward to enforce the law that a correct\nlegal interpretation could provide, and annul the private right\nof action that Congress authorized. As Judge Millett has noted,\n\u201c[s]ince Commission on Hope, approximately two-thirds of\nCommission cases dismissed contrary to the General Counsel\u2019s\nreason-to-believe recommendation have included a reference\nto prosecutorial discretion.\u201d New Models II, 55 F.4th at 929\n(Millett, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).\n\n    Today, the majority triples down. In applying the two\nmistaken rulings, it compounds their error: The opinion\nincorrectly concludes that the commissioners invoked\nenforcement discretion as to all the claims in the first\ncomplaint, Maj. Op. 9, when in reality they did so only with\nrespect to a portion of them. Because Commission on Hope\nand New Models flout binding precedent, they are not\nthemselves \u201cbinding on this panel.\u201d Maj. Op. 12. And even if\nthey were, nothing in those cases prevents us from considering\nthe claims the blocking commissioners dismissed on their\nmerits. I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n                               I.\n\n    The majority obscures important components of the statute\nwe are tasked with interpreting, so I begin with a fuller recap.\n\n                              A.\n\n     To protect the democratic process and bolster public\nconfidence in it, FECA \u201cseeks to remedy any actual or\nperceived corruption of the political process.\u201d Akins, 524 U.S.\nat 14. One of the ways it does so is by limiting the sources and\namounts of expenditures and contributions made \u201cfor the\npurpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\u201d 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(a)(i), (9)(A)(i); id. \u00a7 30116. Soon after\n\f                              4\nCongress enacted FECA, however, the Supreme Court began\nto invalidate many of the Act\u2019s expenditure limits as contrary\nto the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech. See\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 58 (1976) (declaring\nunconstitutional various limits on individual, candidate, and\ncampaign expenditures); see also, e.g., Citizens United v. FEC,\n558 U.S. 310, 365 (2010) (declaring unconstitutional the limit\non corporate expenditures now codified at 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30118(b)). Those decisions leave FECA\u2019s other primary\ntool\u2014disclosure requirements, see, e.g., 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\u2014\nto do much of the work of addressing corrosive influences of\nmoney in politics. Even as the Court struck down expenditure\nlimits, it sustained disclaimer, registration, and disclosure\nrequirements, approving of them as less restrictive ways to\n\u201cenable[] the electorate to make informed decisions and give\nproper weight to different speakers and messages.\u201d Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 371.\n\n     Compliance with campaign finance rules depends on\neffective enforcement and its deterrent effects. Primary\nenforcement responsibility lies with the FEC. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30107(a)(6). The Commission is composed of six members,\nno more than three of whom may be affiliated with a single\npolitical party. Id. \u00a7 30106(a)(1). All decisions must \u201cbe made\nby a majority vote of the members of the Commission,\u201d with\nthe important enforcement decisions specifically requiring a\nbipartisan majority of four or more votes. Id. \u00a7 30106(c). That\nmeans it always takes a majority\u2014indeed, assuming no\nabstentions, a bipartisan majority\u2014to \u201cexercise\u201d the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cduties and powers.\u201d See id.\n\n     In addition to conducting its own investigations, the\nCommission can act on complaints from \u201c[a]ny person\u201d\nalleging campaign finance violations. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(1), (2).\n\f                                5\nFECA maps out a four-step enforcement process for the\nCommission to follow in response to a complaint.\n\n\u2022   First, the Commission votes on whether there is \u201creason to\n    believe\u201d that a violation has occurred. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(2).\n    To tee up such a vote, the Commission\u2019s Office of General\n    Counsel reviews the submissions\u2014including the complaint\n    (with any attached materials such as sworn affidavits) and\n    response\u2014and offers its recommendations. Guidebook for\n    Complainants and Respondents on the FEC Enforcement\n    Process, FEC, at 11-12 (May 2012). 1                   If four\n    commissioners vote that there is reason to believe, the\n    Commission \u201cshall make an investigation of such alleged\n    violation.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\u2022   Second, after the investigation, the Commission votes on\n    whether there is \u201cprobable cause to believe\u201d that a violation\n    has occurred.         Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(4)(A)(i).        If four\n    commissioners agree there is probable cause, the\n    Commission \u201cshall attempt\u201d informal conciliation efforts.\n    Id. (emphasis added).\n\u2022   Third, the Commission votes on whether to approve a\n    conciliation agreement. Id.\n\u2022   Finally, if the conciliation agreement fails to garner four\n    votes, \u201cthe Commission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4\n    of its members, institute a civil action for relief\u201d in federal\n    district court. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A).\n\n     But the Commission need not follow this four-step process\nin every case. It has the power to \u201cvote to dismiss\u201d a complaint\nat any time. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(1). As with \u201c[a]ll decisions of the\nCommission,\u201d dismissal requires a \u201cmajority vote.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30106(c). One reason the Commission might dismiss a\n\n1\n    https:\/\/www.fec.gov\/resources\/cms-content\/documents\/policy-\nguidance\/respondent_guide.pdf.\n\f                                 6\ncomplaint is if the commissioners deadlock\u2014that is, fail to\nobtain a majority as to whether (or how) to proceed. As a\nsafeguard against unreasoned deadlocks by commissioners not\nenforcing the law, Congress explicitly provided for judicial\nreview of both \u201cdismissal\u201d decisions and \u201cfailure[s] to act.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). If the Commission dismisses a complaint or\nfails to act on it within 120 days, an aggrieved party \u201cmay file\na petition\u201d in federal district court. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(A). The\ncourt may then \u201cdeclare [whether] the dismissal of the\ncomplaint or the failure to act is contrary to law.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). A dismissal is \u201ccontrary to law\u201d if, among\nother things, the Commission relied on an impermissible\nconstruction of FECA or if the dismissal was otherwise\narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Orloski, 795\nF.2d at 161. 2\n\n                                 B.\n\n      As noted above, FECA\u2019s judicial review provision is\n\u201cunusual.\u201d Chamber of Commerce, 69 F.3d at 603. Generally,\nas the Supreme Court has explained, \u201can agency\u2019s decision not\nto undertake an enforcement action . . . [is] not subject to\njudicial review.\u201d Akins, 524 U.S. at 26 (citing Heckler, 470\nU.S. at 832). But FECA \u201cexplicitly indicates the contrary\u201d\u2014\ni.e., that the Commission\u2019s decision not to undertake an\nenforcement action is subject to judicial review. Id.\n\n   To facilitate that review, commissioners voting against the\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s enforcement recommendation have an\n\n2\n     The majority suggests in dicta that Orloski and its progeny\nwrongly incorporate arbitrary-and-capricious and abuse-of-\ndiscretion review into FECA\u2019s contrary-to-law standard. Maj. Op.\n7-8 n.3. I would not wander so far afield. The appellee raised no\nobjection to those standards of review, instead quoting as governing\nlaw the very standards the majority would reject. Appellee Br. 6, 28.\n\f                               7\nopportunity to issue one or more statements explaining the\nreasons for their votes. Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d 436,\n449 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Blocking commissioners\u2019 statements of\nreasons help \u201cto make judicial review a meaningful exercise,\u201d\nFEC v. Nat\u2019l Republican Sen. Comm., 966 F.2d 1471, 1476\n(D.C. Cir. 1992). A non-majority cannot speak for the\nCommission, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(c), but non-majority\nstatements can cast light on the reasons for those members\u2019\nvotes. We have long considered both statements of reasons and\nFEC General Counsel\u2019s reports in determining whether a\nCommission action in dismissing a case is \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d\nDCCC, 831 F.2d at 1132, 1134-35.\n\n     FECA\u2019s judicial review provision is unusual for another\nreason. Even when a court determines that a dismissal or\nfailure to act is contrary to law, the Commission retains the\noption not to move forward with enforcement. It has 30 days\nto \u201cconform\u201d with the court\u2019s declaration by, for example,\nproceeding to investigate, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2), or seeking\nto conciliate as to, id. \u00a7 30109(a)(4)(i), an apparent FECA\nviolation, see id. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). If it declines to do so\u2014for\nwhatever reason\u2014FECA empowers the original complainant\nto bring a \u201ccivil action to remedy the violation involved in the\noriginal complaint.\u201d Id. In other words, a court cannot force\nthe Commission to enforce the law; the statute instead\nauthorizes a private litigant to do so, and, even then, only\nfollowing a judicial determination that the Commission\u2019s\nrefusal to proceed was contrary to law.\n\n     In sum, judicial review under FECA is the countermeasure\nto otherwise predictable deadlock at the Commission. It is the\ncourt\u2019s role to detect statutory misreading and thereby prod a\nreluctant FEC to act. And, where the Commission remains\ninert, the court\u2019s ruling paves the way for private enforcement.\nBut the court today continues along the path marked by the\n\f                               8\nwrong turn in Commission on Hope, enabling a non-majority\nof the Commission to diminish the court\u2019s role under FECA\nand to eliminate the private right of action.\n\n                               II.\n\n      For our purposes, the facts of this case can be briefly\nsummarized. End Citizens United filed two administrative\ncomplaints against then-candidate Rick Scott, his campaign,\nand New Republican Political Action Committee (New\nRepublican). Because I agree with the majority\u2019s treatment of\nthe second complaint, I focus on the first. As relevant here, the\nfirst complaint contained four allegations: (1) that Scott failed\nto timely file a statement of candidacy in violation of 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30102(e)(1); (2) that Scott\u2019s campaign failed to timely file\nthe relevant organizational paperwork and disclosure reports in\nviolation of 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30103(a), 30104; (3) that New\nRepublican impermissibly raised and spent money in violation\nof 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125(e); and (4) that Scott impermissibly\nraised and spent money in violation of 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125(e). I\nrefer to the first two allegations as \u201cFiling Claims,\u201d and the\nlatter two as \u201cSoft-money Claims.\u201d\n\n     The Commission held four substantive votes. First, it\nvoted on whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that the Filing\nClaims stated FECA violations. The Commission split 3-3, so\nthe vote \u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 270 (May 28, 2021, Vote Certification).\nA few weeks later, the Commission voted on: (1) whether to\ndismiss the Filing Claims \u201cunder Heckler v. Chaney\u201d; (2)\nwhether there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d the Soft-money\nClaim against New Republican stated a FECA violation; and\n(3) whether to dismiss the Soft-money Claim against Scott.\nAgain, the Commission was evenly divided, so those votes also\n\u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021, Vote Certification).\nDeadlocked, the Commission agreed to \u201c[c]lose the file,\u201d\n\f                                9\nwhich administratively closed the case. J.A. 273 (June 14,\n2021, Vote Certification). Later, the so-called controlling\ncommissioners\u2014the ones who voted against moving forward\nwith enforcement\u2014issued a statement of reasons. They\nexplained that they (1) \u201cexercised [their] prosecutorial\ndiscretion regarding\u201d the Filing Claims; (2) \u201cvoted to find no\nreason to believe\u201d that New Republican violated the soft-\nmoney ban; and (3) \u201cdismissed [the Soft-money Claim against\nScott] for lack of evidence.\u201d J.A. 290-91.\n\n                               III.\n\n     The majority concludes that the dismissal of the first\ncomplaint is \u201cunreviewable\u201d under \u201cbinding precedent\u201d\nbecause \u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked\ntheir prosecutorial discretion.\u201d Maj. Op. 9, 11. I disagree.\nFirst, Commission on Hope and New Models are not binding\nprecedent because, as noted above, they conflict with earlier\ndecisions of the Supreme Court and this court. See Sierra Club\nv. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a\ndecision of one panel is inconsistent with the decision of a prior\npanel, the norm is that the later decision, being in violation of\nthat fixed law, cannot prevail.\u201d). Second, even assuming\nCommission on Hope and New Models are binding precedent,\nthe majority is wrong that all of the dismissals are\nunreviewable.\n\n                               A.\n\n     The majority repeats the mistakes from Commission on\nHope and New Models, which continue to call out for\ncorrection. Those cases held that, when a non-majority\npartisan bloc of commissioners invokes enforcement discretion\nto justify dismissing a complaint, courts cannot review that\ndecision under Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821. For at least\nthree reasons, that is incorrect.\n\f                              10\n    First, Heckler teaches that an \u201cagency\u2019s decision not to\nprosecute or enforce . . . is a decision generally committed to\nan agency\u2019s absolute discretion.\u201d 470 U.S. at 831 (emphasis\nadded). To count as action by the Commission, a decision to\n\u201cdismiss\u201d a claim must \u201cbe made by a majority vote.\u201d 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30106(c), 30109(a)(1). A dismissal vote predicated\non prosecutorial discretion by a majority of commissioners, for\nexample, would amount to an agency decision to refuse\nenforcement. If Heckler applied to FECA, that decision might\nbe unreviewable. In this case, though, the Commission\ndeadlocked; it could not garner a majority vote to do anything\nother than close the file.\n\n     Relying on Commission on Hope and New Models, the\nmajority erroneously treats the three controlling\ncommissioners\u2019 statement explaining their votes against\nenforcement as the Commission\u2019s decision to refuse\nenforcement. Maj. Op. 9-10. A statement of reasons, even by\na non-majority causing a deadlock, explains the standstill and\nhelps \u201cmake judicial review a meaningful exercise.\u201d Nat\u2019l\nRepublican Sen. Comm., 966 F.2d at 1476. But we do not\u2014\nand cannot\u2014treat the controlling commissioners\u2019 rationales or\nvotes as an \u201cexercise\u201d of the Commission\u2019s \u201cduties and\npowers.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(c). To the contrary, we have\nexplained that a statement of reasons for a non-majority\u2019s vote\ncannot be an \u201cofficial Commission decision,\u201d since the latter\nrequires \u201cat least a 4-2 majority vote.\u201d Common Cause, 842\nF.2d at 449 n.32 (emphasis in original). What is more, FECA\nalso provides for review of a \u201cfailure to act\u201d on a complaint\nwithin 120 days, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C), implying that a\ncourt may evaluate the legality of inaction even in the absence\nof any vote or statement of reasons.\n\n    Under the majority\u2019s view, it would make no difference\nwhether a partisan bloc of three commissioners or a bipartisan\n\f                              11\nmajority of four commissioners voted to dismiss a claim based\non prosecutorial discretion\u2014both would be unreviewable. But\nunder FECA, there is a critically important difference between\npartisan and bipartisan action. Even assuming a bipartisan\nmajority\u2019s vote to exercise prosecutorial discretion defeats\njudicial review, affording that power to a non-majority makes\na mockery of the \u201ccarefully balanced bipartisan structure which\nCongress has erected.\u201d Common Cause, 842 F.2d at 449 n.32.\nIt is perverse to treat a non-majority\u2019s statement of reasons,\nelicited to facilitate judicial review, as instead its ticket to\nbypass judicial review altogether. That alone shows that\nCommission on Hope and New Models are wrong.\n\n     Second, even if it were appropriate to treat a non-majority\ninvocation of prosecutorial discretion as an official\nCommission decision, Heckler still would not apply. Heckler\u2019s\npresumption of non-reviewability is just that: a presumption.\n470 U.S. at 831. It \u201cmay be rebutted where the substantive\nstatute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in\nexercising its enforcement powers.\u201d Id. at 833. In Akins, the\nSupreme Court ruled that FECA categorically rebuts that\npresumption because it \u201cexplicitly indicates\u201d that the\nCommission\u2019s decision \u201cnot to undertake an enforcement\naction\u201d is subject to judicial review to determine whether the\nCommission\u2019s passivity is contrary to law. 524 U.S. at 26.\nJudge Silberman, speaking for our en banc court in Akins,\ndescribed judicial review under FECA as \u201can unusual statutory\nprovision which permits a complainant to bring to federal court\nan agency\u2019s refusal to institute enforcement proceedings.\u201d 101\nF.3d 731, 734 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (distinguishing Chaney),\nvacated on other grounds, 524 U.S. 11 (1998). Commission on\nHope and New Models squarely contravene the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s and our own views in Akins, and multiple other\ndecisions of our circuit affirming the reviewability of the\nCommission\u2019s non-enforcement decisions. See, e.g., Chamber\n\f                               12\nof Commerce, 69 F.3d at 603; DCCC, 831 F.2d at 1133;\nOrloski, 795 F.2d at 161.\n\n     Third, Heckler emphasizes that an agency\u2019s non-\nenforcement decision is generally unreviewable because its\nenforcement activity should be \u201ccommitted to an agency\u2019s\nabsolute discretion.\u201d 470 U.S. at 831. That is so because the\nagency must itself assess \u201cwhether agency resources are best\nspent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely\nto succeed if it acts, [and] whether the particular enforcement\naction requested best fits the agency\u2019s overall policies.\u201d Id.\nBut judicial review under FECA need not intrude on the\nCommission\u2019s discretion to balance those factors. To the\ncontrary, FECA\u2019s creation of a private right of action means\nthat, if the Commission declines to investigate a complaint that\na court holds legally sufficient to proceed, private citizens may\ntake up the task without the Commission having to use its own\nresources or act under court direction. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). For this reason, too, the separation-of-\npowers concerns that animated Heckler (and that my\ncolleagues referenced in New Models I, see 993 F.3d at 888)\nare wholly misplaced in the context of FECA.\n\n    Crucially, the case before us does not raise the question\nwhether there may be some circumstances in which FECA\nauthorizes the Commission to exercise unreviewable\nenforcement discretion. For example, a bipartisan majority of\ncommissioners might be able to shut down the enforcement\nprocess at the reason-to-believe phase by explicitly dismissing\na complaint on enforcement-discretion grounds. 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(1); Guidebook at 12. In this case, though, the vote\nover whether to dismiss the Filing Claims \u201cunder Heckler v.\nChaney\u201d \u201cfailed\u201d\u2014it deadlocked 3-3. J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021,\nVote Certification). And the commissioners never even held\nsuch a vote with respect to the Soft-money Claims. So,\n\f                               13\nassuming a bipartisan majority of the Commission could wield\nunreviewable enforcement discretion, it did not do so in this\ncase. The Act also expressly grants discretion to halt a case if,\nafter the complaint travels through all the prescribed\ncheckpoints, the Commission votes against filing a civil action\nfor relief. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A). At that stage, the\nstatute switches from specifying that the commission \u201cshall\u201d\nproceed where statutory standards are met, id. \u00a7 30109(a)(2),\n(a)(4)(A)(i) (emphasis added), to providing that \u201cthe\nCommission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4 of its\nmembers, institute a civil action for relief,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A) (emphasis added). This case, however,\nstalled out at the very beginning, at the reason-to-believe phase.\nA non-majority incantation of enforcement discretion at that\nphase cannot interfere with the court\u2019s obligation under FECA\nto decide whether the Commission\u2019s inaction or dismissal was\n\u201ccontrary to law\u201d\u2014as it would be, for example, if the\ncommissioners voted to dismiss a complaint that, under the law\nas properly understood, gave \u201creason to believe that the\nrespondent has committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nFECA or the presidential campaign funding laws. Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(2), (a)(8)(C).\n\n     All these mistakes have something in common: They\nignore the many ways in which both the Commission and\nFECA\u2019s enforcement scheme are uniquely crafted to avoid\npartisan gridlock. The Supreme Court in Akins appreciated\nhow Congress intended to avoid that gridlock. And, before\nCommission on Hope, we did too.\n\n                               B.\n\n   The majority not only errs by applying Commission on\nHope and New Models; it also misreads the record in this case.\nThe majority rules that \u201cthe controlling commissioners\n\f                               14\nexpressly invoked their prosecutorial discretion when\ndismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj. Op. 9. That is incorrect. The\ncontrolling commissioners were clear in their statement of\nreasons that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. Because the Soft-money Claims\nwere dismissed on the merits, they are reviewable.\n\n     The majority contends that my opinion \u201cmisreads\u201d the\nstatement of reasons, Maj. Op. 11 n.4, but the statement speaks\nfor itself. Over and again, the controlling commissioners made\nclear that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. In the introduction, the controlling\ncommissions explained that they \u201cfound no reason to believe\nthat New Republican violated the soft money rules and\ndismissed the allegations that Scott untimely filed his\ncandidacy and organization paperwork under Heckler v.\nChaney.\u201d       J.A. 282.      In a footnote, the controlling\ncommissioners addressed the Soft-money Claim against Scott:\n\u201cHaving determined there was no path forward on those\nelements, we were required to dismiss\u201d the Soft-money Claim\nbecause that claim \u201cwould have required, at a minimum, a\nthreshold finding that Scott had failed to file a statement of\ncandidacy at the appropriate time, or that New Republican had\nviolated the soft money rules.\u201d J.A. 282 n.2. Later, the\ncontrolling commissioners repeated that \u201cas regards Rick\nScott\u2019s alleged failure to timely file his candidacy and\ncommittee paperwork, we invoked our prosecutorial discretion\npursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A. 290. And, in their\nconclusion, they summarized their votes:\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we voted to find no reason\n    to believe that New Republican violated the soft\n    money ban, exercised our prosecutorial discretion\n    regarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\n    committee failed to timely file candidacy and\n\f                              15\n    organization forms, and dismissed the remaining\n    allegations against the Respondents for lack of\n    evidence.\n\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\n     The controlling commissioners repeatedly tell us that they\nare dismissing the Soft-money claims on the merits, but the\nmajority refuses to take them at their word. It deems the\ndismissal of all four claims unreviewable on the theory that\n\u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked their\nprosecutorial discretion when dismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj.\nOp. 9. There is no basis for that conclusion. The majority\nemphasizes that the controlling commissioners at one point say\nthat they \u201cdetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of\nour prosecutorial discretion.\u201d J.A. 290. The majority appears\nto read \u201cthis Matter\u201d to mean \u201call the claims\u201d in the first\ncomplaint. Maj. Op. 11 n.4. That reading conflicts with what\nthe controlling commissioners actually say. After giving their\nreasons for invoking enforcement discretion, the controlling\ncommissioners clarify the scope of the invocation:\n\u201cAccordingly, as regards Rick Scott\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nfile his candidacy and committee paperwork, we invoked our\nprosecutorial discretion pursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A.\n290 (emphasis added). And they are even clearer in the\nconclusion, where they invoke prosecutorial discretion only\n\u201cregarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\ncommittee failed to timely file candidacy and organization\nforms.\u201d J.A. 290-91 (emphasis added). As to the Soft-money\nClaims, they say that they \u201cvoted to find no reason to believe\u201d\nNew Republican violated the soft money ban, and dismissed\nthe Soft-money Claim against Scott for \u201clack of evidence.\u201d\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\f                              16\n     The majority erroneously concludes that End Citizens\nUnited \u201cdid not raise this argument on appeal.\u201d Maj. Op. 11\nn.4. In fact, End Citizens United argued that dismissal of the\nSoft-money Claims was reviewable, Appellant\u2019s Br. 23-24,\nspecifically described that dismissal as based not on\nenforcement discretion but on an erroneous interpretation of\nFECA, id. 18, and confirmed during oral argument that the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims, not the Soft-money Claims, see\nOral Arg. Rec. at 7:43-9:48. The parties drew the same battle\nline in the district court, compare ECU Opp. to MTD 28-29,\nEnd Citizens United PAC v. FEC, No. 21-cv-2128 (D.D.C.\nSept. 16, 2022), ECF No. 25, with New Republican Reply 11,\nECF No. 29, and even New Republican does not assert\nforfeiture here.\n\n     The court has erred in empowering a partisan bloc of\ncommissioners to invoke enforcement discretion to evade\nreview the statute authorizes. Adding to the muddle that error\nhas created, today\u2019s majority relies on the bloc\u2019s discretionary\nreasoning about the Filing Claims to avoid reviewing the other\nclaims in the first complaint. Because the controlling\ncommissioners did not invoke enforcement discretion with\nrespect to the Soft-money Claims, I would hold the dismissal\nof those claims reviewable even under Commission on Hope\nand New Models.\n\n                             ***\n\n     As I have explained, Commission on Hope and New\nModels contravene FECA, ignore binding precedent, and\nundercut the distinctive features Congress crafted to prevent\npartisan gridlock. The majority\u2019s first mistake is to act as if\nthose decisions are \u201cbinding on this panel.\u201d Maj. Op. 12.\n\f                                  17\n     In any event, the majority overstates the reach of those\ncases. 3 It deems the dismissal of the Soft-money Claims\nunreviewable even though the controlling commissioners\nnever invoked prosecutorial discretion with respect to them.\nThat ruling does not follow from Commission on Hope or New\nModels. If our court is going to authorize a non-majority of\ncommissioners to thwart FECA by invoking prosecutorial\ndiscretion, we should take care to do so only where there is an\nactual invocation. I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Indeed, the majority\u2019s premise\u2014that Commission on Hope and\nNew Models govern this case\u2014is itself questionable. Those cases\nare best read as confined to circumstances in which the controlling\ncommissioners invoke prosecutorial discretion for reasons that are\nindependent of their view of the merits of the claim. See New Models\nII, 55 F.4th at 920-21 (Rao, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing\nen banc) (explaining that judicial review was foreclosed \u201c[b]ecause\nthe controlling commissioners relied on an independent ground of\nprosecutorial discretion\u201d); see also, e.g., Campaign Legal Ctr. v.\nFEC, No. 22-5339, 2024 WL 57355, at *5 (D.C.

See id. We think it would.\n\n       We will enforce an appeal waiver if (1) the appeal falls within the waiver\u2019s\n\n scope, (2) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal, and\n\n (3) enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. See Hahn,\n\n 359 F.3d at 1325.\n\n       Scope of the waiver. Mr. Frederick waived the right to appeal his conviction\n\n and sentence with one exception: He retained the right to challenge the substantive\n\n reasonableness of his sentence if it exceeded the advisory guidelines range. This\n\n exception does not apply, however, because his sentence fell within the guidelines\n\n range. And so his waiver covers this appeal.\n\n       Knowing and voluntary waiver. To determine if a waiver was knowing and\n\n voluntary, we typically focus on two factors\u2014whether the plea agreement says the\n\n defendant entered into it knowingly and voluntarily, and whether the district court\n\n conducted an adequate plea colloquy. See id.\n\n       These factors show that Mr. Frederick knowingly and voluntarily waived his\n\n right to appeal. The plea agreement describes the waiver clearly and says expressly\n\n that Mr. Frederick\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. And during the plea\n\n colloquy, Mr. Frederick confirmed that he understood the plea agreement contained\n\n an appeal waiver, that he had discussed the waiver with his attorney, and that he\n\n understood the rights he was waiving. In short, the record leaves no room for him to\n\n argue his waiver was unknowing or involuntary.\n\n                                            2\n\fAppellate Case: 23-6104     Document: 010110986258         Date Filed: 01\/19\/2024     Page: 3\n\n\n\n       Miscarriage of justice.

Initial Appeal File (IAF),\nTab 14 at 35. This is a dual status position, meaning the appellant was required\nas a condition of his employment to maintain membership in the Selected\nReserve. Id. at 38; see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 10216(a)(1)(A), (C); 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 709. The\nappellant satisfied that requirement through his membership in the Alaska Air\nNational Guard. IAF, Tab 14 at 53. However, on May 17, 2015, the appellant\nwas discharged from military service for medical reasons, and because of his loss\nof membership in the Selected Reserve, he was separated from his dual status\ncivilian Airplane Flight Instructor position effective July 10, 2015. IAF, Tab 13\nat 31-32, Tab 14 at 30. The appellant applied for disability retirement, and the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) granted the appellant\u2019s application under\nthe special provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8456. IAF, Tab 14 at 12. The appellant\u2019s\nannuity commenced September 8, 2015, retroactive to the date of his separation.\nIAF, Tab 13 at 9.\n      As OPM informed the appellant at the time of his retirement and each year\nthereafter, if his earned income in any calendar year were to exceed 80% of the\ncurrent salary of the position from which he retired, he would be considered\nrestored to earning capacity, and his disability annuity would cease on June 30,\nthe following year. IAF, Tab 15 at 9, Tab 16 at 8-13; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8455(a)(2);\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.402(a). On the date of his separation from service, the annual\nsalary of the appellant\u2019s Airplane Flight Instructor position was $104,626. IAF,\nTab 14 at 30.\n      The appellant reported his earned income to OPM every year as required,\nincluding on March 12, 2019, when he reported his earned income for 2018 as\n\f                                                                                    3\n\n$100,009. IAF, Tab 13 at 5. Suspecting that his 2018 earned income exceeded\nthe 80% limitation and having heard nothing about it from OPM, in June 2019,\nthe appellant reached out to an OPM official by telephone and left multiple\nvoicemails inquiring about the status of his disability retirement in light of his\n2018 earnings. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74. However, this official never returned the\nappellant\u2019s calls, and even after the June 30 cutoff date had passed, the appellant\ncontinued receiving his regular monthly annuity. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 12 at 28,\nTab 13 at 42.\n      Then, on January 29, 2020, OPM conducted a \u201cSocial Security Earnings\nMatch\u201d on the appellant\u2019s file and determined that the appellant\u2019s 2018 income\nhad exceeded the 80% limitation. IAF, Tab 12 at 49-52. On February 5, 2020,\nOPM notified the appellant of its findings and directed him to file certain\ndocumentation to verify his 2018 earned income. 2 Id. at 39-40. OPM further\ninformed the appellant that his 80% earnings limitation for 2018 was $88,440,\nand that if his 2018 earned income exceeded that amount, his annuity would be\nterminated retroactively and he would be responsible for repaying any\noverpayment.    Id. at 39-40.    On February 14, 2020, the appellant responded,\nconfirming his 2018 earned income and inquiring as to whether any overpayment\ncould be waived under the circumstances. Id. at 44-45.\n      On March 9, 2020, OPM terminated the appellant\u2019s annuity retroactive to\nJune 30, 2019. IAF, Tab 12 at 25, 35. On April 7, 2020, OPM informed the\nappellant that he had been overpaid a net $25,855.65 in disability retirement\nannuity benefits, which OPM intended to collect.         Id. at 25.    The appellant\nrequested reconsideration, and on July 1, 2020, OPM issued a final decision,\naffirming its initial decision as to the existence and amount of the overpayment,\n\n2\n  Unaware that this problem was caused by its own oversight, OPM was under the\nimpression that the appellant had misreported his 2018 earned income. IAF, Tab 12\nat 39. In fact, the appellant\u2019s self-report of 2018 earned income matched exactly with\nwhat OPM belatedly discovered through a search of his Social Security records. IAF,\nTab 11 at 5, Tab 12 at 51.\n\f                                                                                    4\n\nand proposing to collect the overpayment in monthly installments of $250.         Id.\nat 5-16.\n      The appellant filed a Board appeal in which he did not challenge the\nexistence or amount of the overpayment but instead sought a waiver. IAF, Tab 1\nat 3-5.    He waived his right to a hearing, and the appeal was decided on the\nwritten record. IAF, Tabs 23-24.\n      After the close of the record, the administrative judge issued an initial\ndecision affirming OPM\u2019s final decision. IAF, Tab 26, Initial Decision (ID). He\nfound that, although the appellant was without fault in creating the overpayment,\nthere was no basis to grant his request for a waiver because recovery would not\nbe against equity and good conscience. ID at 11-25. The administrative judge\nnoted that the appellant was also attempting to contest OPM\u2019s retroactive\ncancellation of his health insurance, which had caused him to incur thousands of\ndollars in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, as well as a statement in OPM\u2019s\ndecision letter that he would be ineligible for reinstatement of annuity even if his\nearned income fell below the 80% limitation in the future. ID at 7, 9; IAF, Tab 3\nat 12, Tab 12 at 6.    However, the administrative judge found that the Board\nlacked jurisdiction over these matters in the context of the instant appeal. ID at 9.\n      The appellant has filed a petition for review, disputing the administrative\njudge\u2019s overpayment waiver analysis, as well as his jurisdictional finding\nconcerning the termination of his health insurance. Petition for Review (PFR)\nFile, Tab 1. OPM has responded to the petition for review, and the appellant has\nfiled a reply to OPM\u2019s response. PFR File, Tabs 3-4.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n      Before proceeding to the issues of overpayment and waiver, we first\naddress the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s decision to terminate the appellant\u2019s\nhealth insurance coverage. In his initial decision, the administrative judge found\nthat the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider claims concerning Federal employee\n\f                                                                                        5\n\nhealth insurance benefits.        ID at 9; see Hudson v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 114 M.S.P.R. 669, \u00b6 10 (2010).               On petition for review, the\nappellant cites Chamblin v. Office of Personnel Management, 112 M.S.P.R. 266,\n\u00b6\u00b6 11-13 (2009), arguing that there are certain exceptions to this general rule,\nincluding situations in which the appellant is seeking waiver of an overpayment\ncaused by the retroactive application of insurance premiums. PFR File, Tab 1\nat 10-11.\n      The appellant is correct that the Board may have jurisdiction over health\ninsurance benefits decisions in this context. See Mitchell v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, \u00b6 12 (2004). However, the overpayment in this\ncase did not result from the retroactive application of health insurance premiums,\nand in fact, OPM reduced the amount of the overpayment by retroactively\ndeducting those premiums from the overpayment amount. IAF, Tab 12 at 25, 28.\nMoreover, even if this exception did apply, the Board would still lack jurisdiction\nover OPM\u2019s decision on the appellant\u2019s health insurance benefits per se and\nwould consider the matter only insofar as it bears on the issue of whether\ncollection of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience. See\nMitchell, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. We therefore find no basis to disturb the\nadministrative judge\u2019s finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s\ndecision to retroactively terminate the appellant\u2019s health insurance coverage. 3\nID at 9.\n      Despite finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s health\ninsurance benefits decision per se, consistent with the Board\u2019s holdings in\nChamblin and Mitchell, the administrative judge went on to consider the\nconsequences of this health insurance decision in the context of waiver.               ID\n\n3\n  Although the appellant does not contest this finding on review, we likewise agree with\nthe administrative judge that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the\nappellant\u2019s disability retirement could be reinstated if his income were to fall below the\n80% limitation in the future. ID at 9; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(h) (\u201cThe Board shall not\nissue advisory opinions.\u201d).\n\f                                                                                       6\n\nat 23-24. We likewise consider this matter in the context of our waiver analysis\nbelow.\n      OPM bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence the existence\nand amount of an annuity overpayment.                Vojas v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 115 M.S.P.R. 502, \u00b6 10 (2011); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(b)(2)(ii).\nBecause the appellant was restored to earning capacity as of December 31, 2018,\nhis disability retirement annuity should have ceased effective June 30, 2019. See\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8455(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.402(a). Because OPM continued to pay the\nannuity through February 2020 (eight extra monthly annuity payments), the\nappellant received an overpayment of annuity. IAF, Tab 7 at 23; see Ruskin v.\nOffice of Personnel Management, 73 M.S.P.R. 544, 547, 551 (1997).                   The\nappellant does not dispute OPM\u2019s calculation that the net overpayment amounted\nto $25,855.65.    IAF, Tab 11 at 9, Tab 12 at 5, 28.         This calculation appears\ncorrect on its face, and we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge\u2019s\nfinding that OPM proved the existence and the amount of the overpayment. ID\nat 10-11.\n      An overpayment of FERS annuity is subject to recovery under the\nprovisions of 5 C.F.R. part 845, subpart B. However, recovery of an overpayment\nmay not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of OPM, the\nindividual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good\nconscience. 4 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301. The appellant bears the\nburden of establishing his entitlement to a waiver by substantial evidence.\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.307(b), 1201.56(b)(2)(ii). For the reasons explained in the initial\ndecision, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was without\nfault in causing the overpayment, and OPM does not dispute this finding on\n\n4\n  The regulatory standards for waiver of overpayments under FERS are substantially\nsimilar, and indeed almost identical, to those under the Civil Service Retirement System\n(CSRS). Compare 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart N, with 5 C.F.R. part 845, subpart C. We\nfind the case law interpreting the CSRS regulations to be instructive in interpreting the\nFERS regulations.\n\f                                                                                  7\n\nreview. ID at 12-14. Therefore, the only remaining issue regarding waiver of the\noverpayment is whether recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\n      OPM\u2019s regulations set forth three circumstances under which recovery\nwould be against equity and good conscience\u2014financial hardship, detrimental\nreliance, and unconscionability.      5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.303.      In this case, the\nadministrative judge found that the appellant was seeking waiver on the bases of\ndetrimental reliance and unconscionability. ID at 17-18. However, he found that\nthe appellant knew or suspected that he was receiving erroneous payments from\nOPM, and was therefore obligated to set these payments aside pending resolution\nof the matter. ID at 18-22. Because the set-aside rule applied in this case, the\nadministrative judge found that only exceptional circumstances involving\nextremely egregious delays or errors by OPM would entitle the appellant to a\nwaiver.   ID at 22.   The administrative judge considered the nature of OPM\u2019s\nerrors, the length of the delays involved in correcting the overpayment, and the\ncircumstances surrounding the appellant\u2019s loss of health insurance, but he found\nthat these did not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances that would\nwarrant a waiver of the overpayment. ID at 22-25. The appellant disputes these\nfindings on review.\n      First, we address the appellant\u2019s argument that the set-aside rule should not\napply in his case. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-10. Under section I.C.4 of OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments, an individual who suspects an\noverpayment and promptly notifies OPM of the matter is required to set the\nmoney aside pending recovery by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15; see Slater v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 510, 516-17 (1989). This is known as the\n\u201cset-aside rule,\u201d and the collection of money subject to this rule is not against\nequity and good conscience absent exceptional circumstances involving extremely\negregious errors or delays by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15. The appellant argues that\nthe set-aside rule should not apply in his case because it was not reasonable to\nexpect him to calculate the 80% earning limitation, considering that this is OPM\u2019s\n\f                                                                                   8\n\njob and he did not have sufficient information to make an accurate calculation\nhimself. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-7. He further argues that he acted diligently by\ninquiring about the matter to OPM, and that he reasonably interpreted OPM\u2019s\nunresponsiveness as an indication that his 2018 income did not exceed the 80%\nlimitation. Id. at 7-10.\n      We agree with the appellant\u2019s argument.        As the administrative judge\ncorrectly found, regardless of whether the appellant should reasonably have\nsuspected that he exceeded the 80% income limitation for 2018, he did in fact\nsuspect this, as evidenced by his own admissions and his follow-up telephone\ncalls to OPM. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 17 at 15. However, this is not the end of the\nmatter. The appellant\u2019s suspicion was not that he had received an overpayment\nbut that he had exceeded the 80% income limitation and that his annuity would\ntherefore be terminated in the future; the appellant had not actually received any\noverpayment of annuity until the month after he left OPM two voicemails about\nthe situation. In this regard, we find substantial evidence that the appellant acted\nin a reasonably prudent manner by timely and accurately reporting his 2018\nincome to OPM and then following up with OPM when he had not gotten notice\nthat his annuity would be terminated. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74, Tab 13 at 5.\n      Furthermore, the appellant reasonably directed his follow-up inquiries to\nthe telephone number listed by the OPM official who had previously responded to\nthe appellant about another matter concerning his disability retirement annuity.\nIAF, Tab 3 at 74, Tab 12 at 23.      Therefore, regardless of what the appellant\nsuspected or should have suspected based on his 2018 income alone, by the time\nhe actually started receiving the annuity overpayment, things had changed\nbecause OPM had remained persistently silent about the appellant\u2019s annuity status\ndespite his multiple inquiries, thus leading him to believe that there was not any\nproblem with his annuity. As the appellant accurately points out, OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines specifically state that a determination of whether an individual \u201cknew\u201d\nor \u201cshould have known\u201d something should account for \u201cwhether OPM failed to\n\f                                                                                       9\n\nrespond to an inquiry by the debtor as to the correctness of payment(s) and, thus,\ncaused the debtor to reasonably believe that the payment(s) was correct.\u201d PFR\nFile, Tab 1 at 9, Tab 17 at 11-12. Based on the facts above, we find substantial\nevidence to support the appellant\u2019s claim that, despite his earlier suspicions,\nOPM\u2019s failure to respond to his multiple inquiries led him to reasonably assume\nthat he was still eligible for disability retirement benefits. IAF, Tab 6 at 6-7.\n      We acknowledge that the appellant could perhaps have done more by\npersisting in his inquiries to OPM until he received a definitive answer one way\nor the other.   However, this is a level of persistence not required by OPM\u2019s\nGuidelines.     IAF, Tab 17 at 12.        Furthermore, we find that it would be\ninappropriate to place such a level of responsibility on a disability retirement\nannuitant because he is not responsible for administering his own annuity, and he\nshould be entitled to presume that OPM would not likely create an overpayment\nsituation by failing to take note of his income report both when he filed it and\nwhen he contacted OPM multiple times to ask about it. For these reasons, we\nfind substantial evidence that, by the time the appellant began receiving an\nannuity overpayment in July 2019, he no longer reasonably suspected that his\nannuity was continuing in error, and that the set -aside rule does not apply. 5 See\nWright v. Office of Personnel Management, 105 M.S.P.R. 419, \u00b6 5 (2007).\n      We emphasize that the appellant\u2019s burden of proving entitlement to waiver\nof an annuity overpayment is by substantial evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.307(b),\n1201.56(b)(2)(ii). This is a lower standard of proof than preponderance of the\nevidence and is defined as \u201c[t]he degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable\nperson, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a\n5\n  The appellant argues in the alternative that, even if the rule applies, waiver is still\nwarranted due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d PFR File, Tab 1 at 16-26; IAF, Tab 17\nat 15; see James v. Office of Personnel Management, 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 217 (1996)\n(explaining that collection of monies subject to the set-aside rule may be waived only in\nexceptional circumstances). Because we have found that the set-aside rule does not\napply, we decline to make any findings on this issue. However, we have considered the\nappellant\u2019s arguments in this regard to the extent that they bear on whether collection\nwould be unconscionable under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c).\n\f                                                                                  10\n\nconclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree.\u201d           5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1201.4(p). Even if the evidence could be interpreted another way, that does not\nmean that the interpretation discussed in paragraphs 17-19 above is not also\nreasonable. This is all that is required for the appellant to carry his burden on the\nissue of waiver. See In re Jolley, 308 F.3d 1317, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cIf the\nevidence in record will support several reasonable but contradictory conclusions,\nwe will not find the Board\u2019s decision unsupported by substantial evidence simply\nbecause the Board chose one conclusion over another plausible alternative.\u201d).\n      Because the set-aside rule does not apply, we now consider whether\nrecovery would be against equity and good conscience under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301,\non the bases of financial hardship, detrimental reliance, or unconscionability. See\nHarrison v. Office of Personnel Management, 57 M.S.P.R. 89, 94-95 & n.5\n(1993). Regarding financial hardship, although the appellant argues that he has\nbeen financially damaged by OPM\u2019s delay in terminating his annuity, we do not\nconstrue this as an argument that collection of the overpayment would result in\n\u201cfinancial hardship\u201d within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.301(a) and 845.304,\ni.e., that he lacks the means to repay the debt without impoverishing himself.\nIAF, Tab 17 at 16-19.\n      Nor do we find that the appellant is entitled to wavier under 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 845.301(c) on the basis of unconscionability. Consistent with OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, the Board has found that the unconscionability criterion is a high\nstandard that will only be met under exceptional circumstances.         IAF, Tab 17\nat 21-22; see Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549\n(1989). Because the concept of unconscionability is generally defined in terms of\nbroad, equitable considerations, the Board will consider all relevant factors using\na \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d approach in order to determine whether recovery\nof an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case. Id. at 550.\n      The appellant cites to OPM\u2019s multiple failures to take note of his 2018\nearnings and its consequent delay in terminating his annuity, as well as OPM\u2019s\n\f                                                                                      11\n\naccusations of fraud and attempts to blame him for the overpayment. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 16-29. However, OPM\u2019s delay in terminating the appellant\u2019s annuity\nand notifying him of the overpayment was less than a year. IAF, Tab 12 at 25,\n35. Although this delay was unfortunate, we find that it was not so egregiously\nexcessive as to meet the high standard of unconscionability in 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 845.301(c). 6    See also Newcomb v. Office of Personnel Management,\n42 M.S.P.R. 552, 554, 559 (finding that OPM\u2019s delay of less than 2 years in\ndiscovering an overpayment did not render collection unconscionable); cf. Estate\nof Konschak v. Office of Personnel Management, 84 M.S.P.R. 555, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14\n(1999) (finding that OPM\u2019s 22-year delay in discovering an overpayment of more\nthan $100,000 rendered collection of that amount from an 82-year old annuitant\nunconscionable).    As for OPM\u2019s recriminations against him, the appellant no\ndoubt found these to be both insulting and frustrating. However, we agree with\nthe administrative judge that there is insufficient basis to conclude that OPM\u2019s\naccusations were knowingly false, and in any event, this error was without\nconsequence to the appeal. ID at 22. The appellant has suffered no tangible harm\nfrom OPM\u2019s erroneous attribution of fault.          Nor do there appear to be any\nextenuating circumstances such as advanced age or mental disability that might\nweigh in favor of a finding of unconscionability. For the reasons explained in the\ninitial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that the totality of the\ncircumstances do not support a finding that recovery would be unconscionable\nunder the circumstances. 7 ID at 22-25.\n\n6\n  In making this determination, we have considered that the delays involved in this case\nare far shorter than the 4 years necessary to carry a presumption of unconscionability\nunder OPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines. IAF, Tab 17 at 22; see Newcomb v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 552, 558-59 (1989).\n7\n  The administrative judge made this finding in the context of his analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed to warrant waiver of the overpayment\nnotwithstanding the set-aside rule. ID at 22-25. However, under OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, the standard for waiver notwithstanding the set-aside rule is similar to the\nstandard for waiver based on unconscionability. IAF, Tab 17 at 15, 21-22. Therefore,\nwe find that the administrative judge\u2019s analysis was not inconsistent with an analysis of\n\f                                                                                   12\n\n      Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we agree with the appellant that he\nis entitled to a partial waiver of the overpayment based on detrimental reliance\nunder 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c). PFR File, Tab 1 at 11-16. Under OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, detrimental reliance occurs when the overpayment recipient\nrelinquishes a valuable right or changes positions for the worse because of the\nerroneous payment or because of notice that such payment would be made. IAF,\nTab 17 at 19. To justify waiver, the loss of right or change of position must be\ndirectly caused by the overpayment or notice of payment, detrimental to the\nrecipient, material, and irrevocable.    Id.   OPM defines \u201cvaluable right\u201d as a\nprivilege, claim, entitlement, or benefit that has monetary worth.           Id.   An\nindividual changes positions for the worse when he is left in a worse financial\nposition after recovery than he was prior to his receipt of the overpayment. Id.\nat 20. The concepts of losing a valuable right and changing positions for the\nworse can often simultaneously apply to the same situation. Id.\n      In this case, we find that the overpayment of annuity directly caused the\nappellant to relinquish the valuable right of employer-sponsored health insurance.\nAs the appellant explains it, if OPM had notified him in timely manner that his\ndisability retirement benefits were going to be terminated, he would have\npurchased employer-sponsored health insurance in July 2019.             IAF, Tab 6\nat 13-14. However, relying on OPM\u2019s failure to terminate his annuity and its\nsilence in the face of his multiple inquiries, the appellant believed that his Federal\nhealth insurance benefits would continue, and so he did not purchase alternative\ninsurance at that time.   Id. Believing that he was still covered under Federal\nhealth insurance benefits, the appellant continued to incur healthcare expenses\nover the following months, and his medical bills continued to be paid by his\ninsurance, which had not yet been canceled.         Then, when OPM retroactively\ncancelled the appellant\u2019s Federal health insurance benefits on March 9, 2020, his\n\nwhether exceptional circumstances existed so as to warrant waiver of the overpayment\non unconscionability grounds under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c).\n\f                                                                                      13\n\nformer insurer sought reimbursement from providers for all the claims that he had\nmade since August 2019, 8 resulting in $5,451.95 in uninsured healthcare liability\nfor the appellant. IAF, Tab 3 at 12, 51, 62-73.\n      Furthermore, the appellant has shown that the timing of OPM\u2019s actions\nrendered him unable, as a practical matter, to obtain employer-sponsored health\ninsurance for the 17-month period from between August 2019 and January 2021.\nIAF, Tab 3 at 7. Specifically, health insurance open enrollment at the appellant\u2019s\nemployer occurs in the fall, and coverage begins the following January. PFR\nFile, Tab 1 at 12. To obtain coverage outside that period, an individual must\nenroll within 31 days of a qualifying life event.        IAF, Tab 3 at 13, 53.      The\nappellant\u2019s loss of Federal health insurance constituted a qualifying life event, but\ndue to its retroactive nature, the appellant was not apprised of it until well after\nthe 31-day window had passed, and his employer denied the appellant\u2019s\nApril 2020 application for out-of-season enrollment for that reason. Id. at 54-61.\nBecause the 2019 open enrollment season had already passed by the time OPM\ninformed the appellant about his retroactive loss of coverage, the appellant\u2019s next\nopportunity to enroll with his employer was in the 2020 open season, for\ncoverage beginning January 1, 2021. PFR File, Tab 1 at 12.\n      Turning to the criteria set forth in OPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines for waiver\nbased on the loss of a valuable right, IAF, Tab 17 at 19, for the reasons explained\nabove, we find that employer-sponsored health insurance is a valuable right and\nthat the appellant\u2019s decision to forego it is directly attributable to the\noverpayment of annuity. 9     We also find that the appellant\u2019s relinquishment of\nemployer-sponsored health insurance was materially detrimental to his financial\n8\n  This accounts for the June 30, 2019 termination of the appellant\u2019s coverage, as well as\na 31-day extension that allowed his claims to be covered through July 2019. IAF, Tab 3\nat 51.\n9\n  We note that the appellant\u2019s Federal health insurance premiums were paid for by\ndeductions from his disability retirement annuity and that his eligibility for Federal\nhealth insurance benefits was inextricably linked to his status as an annuitant. See\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306(a)(1).\n\f                                                                                   14\n\nsituation because it resulted in a financial loss to him in the form of substantial\nout-of-pocket medical expenses that would otherwise have been paid by his\ninsurer. We further find that the relinquishment of this benefit is irrevocable, as\nwe are unaware of any mechanism for obtaining retroactive health insurance\ncoverage. We therefore find that the appellant has proven by substantial evidence\nthat he is entitled to waiver under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(b) on the basis of his loss\nof a valuable right.      IAF, Tab 17 at 19; see King v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 730 F.3d 1342, 1348-51 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Observing that, after\ncollection of the overpayment, the appellant will be left in a worse financial\nposition than if he had never received the overpayment in the first place, we also\nfind that the appellant is entitled to waiver under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(b) because\nhe has changed his position for the worse. IAF, Tab 17 at 20; see Gromo v.\nOffice of Personnel Management, 944 F.2d 882, 884-85 (1991).\n         Nevertheless, because the appellant\u2019s claimed financial losses of $5,451.95\nrepresent a relatively small part of the total overpayment amount, we find that it\nwould be inappropriate to grant a waiver for the entire $25,855.65. According to\nOPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines, the amount of the waiver should depend on the degree\nto which the individual\u2019s position was changed for the worse, and a partial waiver\nmay be granted that appropriately reflects the degree of detrimental reliance.\nIAF, Tab 17 at 20-21; see Fearon v. Office of Personnel Management,\n109 M.S.P.R. 606, \u00b6 5 (2008). In this case, we find that it would be appropriate\nto grant a partial waiver of the overpayment, such that the appellant will not\nrealize a windfall but will still not be in a worse financial position due to his loss\nof health insurance coverage fairly attributable to OPM\u2019s error.\n         Nevertheless, the precise amount of the waiver that should be granted is not\nclear from the extant record.      The appellant below stated that the retroactive\ntermination of his annuity resulted in $5,451.95 in extra uncovered healthcare\nexpenses for him, and he has provided some documentation to substantiate his\nclaim.     IAF, Tab 3 at 12, 51, 62-73.      However, on petition for review, the\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nappellant appears to be claiming a total of $5,600 in extra expenses. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 14. Furthermore, it does not seem that the appellant deducted from this\ntotal the healthcare premiums that he would have otherwise been paying through\nhis employer if OPM had timely notified him of the termination of his annuity.\nNor is it clear to us whether the appellant\u2019s claimed amount represents only the\nperiod of retroactivity or whether it also encompasses uncovered healthcare\nexpenses that he may have incurred between March 9, 2020, and the\ncommencement of his employer-sponsored insurance on January 1, 2021.            For\nthese reasons, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for the administrative\njudge to take relevant evidence and argument and decide on an appropriate partial\nwaiver amount in the first instance. This might be a rather complex calculation\nwith many factors involved and may require a considerable amount of judgment\nand discretion. Therefore, the parties are strongly encouraged to cooperate in\ngood faith and, if possible, arrive at a mutually agreeable figure to present to the\nadministrative judge.\n\n                                     ORDER\n      For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the Western\nRegional Office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                        ______________________________\n                                      Jennifer Everling\n                                      Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f","                       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n                    MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD\n\n\n    JOSHUA D.

In contrast, a\nprecedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\nas significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law.

The initial decision became the Board\u2019s\nfinal decision on December 22, 2016, after neither party filed a petition for\nreview. In the compliance initial decision, the administrative judge ordered the\nagency to submit evidence of full compliance.          CID at 5.

CID at 5-6; see 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1201.183(a)(6)(i). He also informed the parties of their option to request Board\nreview of the compliance initial decision by filing a petition for review by\nMarch 20, 2018, the date on which the findings of noncompliance would become\nfinal unless a petition for review was filed.

Neither party filed any\nsubmission with the Clerk\u2019s Office within the time limit set forth in 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1201.114.       Accordingly,   pursuant   to   5   C.F.R.   \u00a7 1201.183(b)-(c),   the\nadministrative judge\u2019s findings of noncompliance became final, and the\nappellant\u2019s petition for enforcement was referred to the Board for a final decision\non issues of compliance.

For the reasons discussed below, we GRANT the appellant\u2019s petition for\nreview, AFFIRM the initial decision\u2019s finding that, although the appellant\nadministratively   exhausted    seven    personnel   actions   and   eight   protected\n1\n   A nonprecedential order is one that the Board has determined does not add\nsignificantly to the body of MSPB case law. Parties may cite nonprecedential orders,\nbut such orders have no precedential value; the Board and administrative judges are not\nrequired to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a\nprecedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\nas significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117(c).\n\f                                                                                     2\n\ndisclosures, certain other personnel actions were not exhausted, AFFIRM the\ninitial decision\u2019s determination that the appellant established by preponderant\nevidence that he made protected disclosures that were contributing factors in the\nchallenged personnel actions, REVERSE the initial decision\u2019s finding that the\nappellant did not administratively exhaust three disclosures made to the Office of\nInspector General (OIG) in May and June 2012, FIND that the appellant\nnonfrivolously   alleged   that   these   three   disclosures   were   protected   and\ncontributing factors in at least some of the personnel actions at issue in this case,\nVACATE the remainder of the initial decision, and REMAND the case to the\nregional office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n      In September 2011, the appellant was assigned to the position of Deputy\nDirector, 48th Force Support Squadron, 48th Mission Support Group, 48th Fighter\nWing, RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom.             Initial Appeal File (IAF), Tab 113\nat 4. In late 2012, the agency ended his assignment to the United Kingdom and\nreturned him to a position in the United States. Id. at 7.\n      The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\non March 21, 2013. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II. In his OSC complaint, he alleged\nthat, in reprisal for protected disclosures he made beginning in February 2012, the\nagency (1) threatened to curtail his overseas tour, (2) denied him a performance\naward, (3) placed him on administrative leave, (4) temporarily reassigned him,\n(5) suspended him for 7 days, (6) threatened again to curtail his overseas tour,\n(7) initiated several investigations targeting him, and (8) reassigned him from his\nassignment in the United Kingdom to a position in the United States. Id. at 11.\nIn addition to those acts of alleged whistleblower reprisal, the appellant also\nalleged in his OSC complaint that the agency had engaged in several other\nprohibited personnel practices. Id. at 6.\n\f                                                                                    3\n\n      On June 20, 2013, OSC issued a letter closing out its investigation and\nnotifying the appellant of his right to file an IRA appeal. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I\nat 20. He timely filed this appeal on August 16, 2013. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I. He\ninitially requested a hearing, id. at 3, but he later withdrew that request, IAF,\nTab 121.\n      In her initial decision, the administrative judge 2 found that the appellant\nhad exhausted his administrative remedies as to the eight allegedly retaliatory\npersonnel actions enumerated in his OSC complaint and initial appeal.            IAF,\nTab 135, Initial Decision (ID) at 9. She found, however, that the appellant had\nnot exhausted as to the additional alleged prohibited personnel practices he\nidentified in his OSC complaint because he did not specifically identify those\nactions to OSC as alleged whistleblower reprisal. Id. The administrative judge\nfurther found that the appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies as\nto any additional disclosures he made in complaints to the agency\u2019s OIG because\nhe did not specifically identify those disclosures as whistleblowing disclosures\nprotected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). ID at 10-11.\n      After finding that the appellant had established jurisdiction over his IRA\nappeal, ID at 13-15, the administrative judge found that the appellant proved by\npreponderant evidence that he made protected disclosures that were a contributing\nfactor in the personnel actions at issue, ID at 15-18, thus establishing his prima\nfacie case of whistleblower reprisal.       The administrative judge also found,\nhowever, that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would\nhave taken each of the personnel actions in the absence of the appellant\u2019s\ndisclosures.   ID at 19-40.     She therefore denied the appellant\u2019s request for\ncorrective action. ID at 41.\n      The appellant has timely filed a petition for review of the initial decision.\nPetition for Review (PFR) File, Tab 1. He argues that the administrative judge\n2\n  The appeal was reassigned to a different administrative judge in February 2016, IAF,\nTab 51, approximately 6 months before the initial decision was issued, IAF, Tab 135,\nInitial Decision.\n\f                                                                                      4\n\nerred in finding that he failed to exhaust his claims regarding the additional\ndisclosures to OIG. Id. at 6-7. He also argues that the administrative judge erred\nin failing to consider either the alleged retaliatory investigations or the denial of\nhis grievance as separate personnel actions. Id. at 7-8. In addition, the appellant\nchallenges the administrative judge\u2019s findings that the agency proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that it would have taken each of the personnel actions at\nissue in the absence of his protected disclosures. Id. at 9-23. The appellant also\nargues that the administrative judge made errors in her procedural and\ndiscovery-related rulings.    Id. at 24-27.    The agency has filed a response in\nopposition to the petition for review, PFR File, Tab 3, and the appellant has filed\na reply, PFR File, Tab 4.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\nThe appellant did not make an informed decision to withdraw his request for a\nhearing.\n      The appellant withdrew his hearing request and requested a decision on the\nwritten record on June 27, 2016, two days before the scheduled hearing. IAF,\nTabs 112, 121. In withdrawing his hearing request, the appellant cited a number\nof factors.   First, he cited the administrative judge\u2019s failure to suspend case\nprocessing in light of the agency\u2019s production of documents in discovery shortly\nbefore the scheduled hearing date. 3      IAF, Tab 121 at 4.        He also cited the\nadministrative judge\u2019s denial of his request to conduct self-recorded oral\ndepositions. Id. However, he indicated that in light of the parties\u2019 stipulations,\nalong with the evidence already in the record and the opportunity to submit a\nsworn statement, he believed there were sufficient undisputed material facts\nbefore the Board to make a finding of retaliation without a hearing. Id. In an\norder issued the following day, the administrative judge indicated that the\n3\n  On May 27 and June 8, 2016, the appellant requested that the administrative judge\nsuspend case processing in light of the difficulty he was having obtaining and reviewing\ndiscovery documents from the agency. IAF, Tabs 93, 108. The administrative judge\ndenied both requests. IAF, Tabs 96, 112.\n\f                                                                                        5\n\nappellant\u2019s pleading withdrawing his hearing request had misstated the status of\nthe parties\u2019 stipulations. IAF, Tab 122 at 1. She therefore gave the appellant\nuntil later the same day to rescind his withdrawal and proceed with a hearing. Id.\nThe appellant filed a pleading later that day in response to the administrative\njudge\u2019s order, but he did not indicate that he wanted to go forward with the\nhearing. IAF, Tab 123.\n      An appellant before the Board has the right to withdraw his request for a\nhearing; however, there is a strong policy in favor of granting an appellant a\nhearing on the merits of his case, and therefore, withdrawal of a hearing request\nmust come by way of clear, unequivocal, or decisive action.                 Pariseau v.\nDepartment of the Air Force, 113 M.S.P.R. 370, \u00b6 9 (2010); Conant v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 79 M.S.P.R. 148, 150 (1998). Further, the decision to\nwithdraw a hearing request must be informed, i.e., the appellant must be fully\napprised of the relevant adjudicatory requirements and options.                Pariseau,\n113 M.S.P.R. 370, \u00b6 9.\n      Although the appellant\u2019s withdrawal of his hearing request was clear and\nequivocal, we find that it was not informed. An appellant\u2019s waiver of the right to\na hearing is informed when he has been fully apprised of the relevant\nadjudicatory requirements and options in his case, including the right to request a\npostponement or continuance of the hearing and a dismissal of the appeal without\nprejudice to its timely refiling. Conant, 79 M.S.P.R. at 151. Here, the record\nreflects that the appellant was aware of his right to request a suspension of case\nprocessing.    IAF, Tabs 93, 108.       However, there is nothing in the record to\nindicate that the administrative judge apprised the appellant that he could request\na dismissal without prejudice as an alternative to withdrawing his hearing\nrequest. 4 Therefore, given the strong policy in favor of granting an appellant a\n\n\n4\n The lack of such notice is particularly significant here, wherein the appellant cited the\nadministrative judge\u2019s refusal to suspend case processing as a significant factor in his\ndecision to withdraw his hearing request.\n\f                                                                                    6\n\nhearing on the merits of his appeal, the appellant may be entitled to the hearing\nhe initially requested and which he evidently still desires.\n\nThe appellant established Board jurisdiction over his alleged disclosures to OIG.\n      Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(3), an employee is required to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies with OSC before seeking corrective action from the\nBoard in an IRA appeal.          Mason v. Department of Homeland Security,\n116 M.S.P.R. 135, \u00b6 8 (2011). The Board may consider only those disclosures of\ninformation and personnel actions that the appellant raised before OSC. Id. To\nsatisfy the exhaustion requirement of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(3), an appellant must\nhave provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation into his\nallegations of whistleblower reprisal. Skarada v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Chambers v. Department of Homeland Security, 2022 MSPB\n8, \u00b6 10. Generally, an appellant may demonstrate exhaustion through his initial\nOSC complaint, evidence that he amended the original complaint (including but\nnot limited to OSC\u2019s determination letter and other letters from OSC referencing\nany amended allegations), and his written responses to OSC.               Skarada,\n2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Mason, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, \u00b6 8. Alternatively, an appellant\nmay prove exhaustion though other sufficiently reliable evidence, such as an\naffidavit or declaration attesting that he raised with OSC the substance of the\nfacts in his appeal. Skarada, 2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Chambers, 2022 MSPB 8, \u00b6 11.\n      Here, the administrative judge found that, although the appellant had\nexhausted his administrative remedies as to eight alleged protected disclosures, he\nfailed to exhaust as to three additional disclosures made to OIG in May and\nJune 2012 because he did not specifically identify those disclosures to OSC as\nwhistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).        ID at 10-11.    The\nadministrative judge acknowledged that information regarding the three\nadditional disclosures were among the materials the appellant submitted to OSC,\nbut she found that their inclusion \u201camong the hundreds of pages of other\ndocuments he submitted to OSC\u201d was insufficient to satisfy the exhaustion\n\f                                                                                       7\n\nrequirement. ID at 11. She noted that the appellant had not included those OIG\ncomplaints among the list of eight protected disclosures he specifically identified\nin his complaint to OSC. Id. 5\n      Although the appellant did not specifically identify the three additional\ndisclosures to OIG as alleged whistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8), the labels he used are not determinative. See McCarthy v. Merit\nSystems Protection Board, 809 F.3d 1365, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (noting that \u201cthe\nfocus of the exhaustion requirement is on substance,\u201d rather than whether the\nappellant correctly affixed legal labels to the facts alleged).          The appellant\nprovided information to OSC about the content of his complaints to OIG. IAF,\nTab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab A at 7-8; IAF, Tab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab C,\nSubtabs 44, 46. He also alleged before OSC that his OIG complaints constituted\nprotected disclosures that were the bases for at least some allegedly retaliatory\npersonnel actions. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab B at 6-7. This was sufficient\nfor OSC to pursue an investigation into whether the agency violated 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8) or (b)(9) by retaliating against the appellant for filing his OIG\ncomplaints. 6   We therefore find that the appellant satisfied the exhaustion\nrequirement as to the three additional disclosures to OIG. We must therefore\ndetermine whether the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his disclosures to\nOIG constituted protected disclosures that were a contributing factor in one or\nmore of the challenged personnel actions. See Yunus v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the Board has jurisdiction over an\n\n5\n  We agree with the administrative judge that because the events at issue in this case\ntook place before the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act\nof 2012, the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in this IRA appeal is limited to claims of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Therefore, the appellant\u2019s claim that the\nagency retaliated against him for filing OIG complaints in violation of 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(9) is not itself a basis for Board jurisdiction. Colbert v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, \u00b6 7 (2014).\n6\n  OSC is required to investigate all allegations of prohibited personnel practices,\nregardless of whether those allegations can form the basis of an IRA appeal before the\nBoard. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A).\n\f                                                                                      8\n\nIRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies\nbefore OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that (1) he engaged in\nwhistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure and (2) the disclosure\nwas a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a\npersonnel action).\n      A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the\nmatter at issue. Bradley v. Department of Homeland Security, 123 M.S.P.R. 547,\n\u00b6 6 (2016); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.4(s). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit has found that, in the context of an IRA appeal, a nonfrivolous allegation\nis an allegation of \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board, 979 F.3d\n1362, 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2020).        Whether allegations are nonfrivolous is\ndetermined on the basis of the written record. Bradley, 123 M.S.P.R. 547, \u00b6 6.\nAny doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant made nonfrivolous\njurisdictional allegations should be resolved in favor of finding jurisdiction. Id.\n      A nonfrivolous allegation of a protected whistleblowing disclosure is an\nallegation of fact that, if proven, would show that the appellant disclosed a matter\nthat a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced one of the\ncategories of wrongdoing specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).               Salerno v.\nDepartment of the Interior, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, \u00b6 6 (2016). The test to determine\nwhether a putative whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the disclosure is an\nobjective one: whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential\nfacts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably\nconclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of any law, rule, or\nregulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority,\nor a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Id.; see 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8).   For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that each of his disclosures to OIG was protected.\n\f                                                                                      9\n\n      On May 21, 2012, the appellant filed a complaint with OIG alleging that\nthe agency violated its own procedures in suspending his clearance. IAF, Tab 1,\nVolume II at 616-19. On May 16, 2012, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat his security clearance was being suspended temporarily and he was being\nplaced on administrative leave pending an investigation into alleged misconduct.\nId. at 603. In his OIG complaint, the appellant alleged that the suspension of his\nclearance violated the procedures set forth in the agency\u2019s internal rules.         Id.\nat 617.   According to the appellant, he was later informed that despite his\ncommander\u2019s notice, his security clearance was not formally suspended.              Id.\nat 74-76. Nevertheless, the appellant reasonably believed at the time he filed his\nOIG complaint that the agency had suspended his security clearance contrary to\nits own policies. We find the appellant has thus nonfrivolously alleged that he\ndisclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation, and that the disclosure in his first\nOIG complaint is therefore protected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).\n      The appellant filed a second OIG complaint 2 days after the first alleging\nthat one of his supervisors was retaliating against him for meeting with OIG\n2 days earlier.   IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 621-24.        Specifically, the appellant\nalleged that shortly after he informed a management official that he had an\nappointment with OIG on May 21, the agency started a new security investigation\ninto him. The appellant alleged that the facts giving rise to the investigation were\nknown to the agency for 2 days, but the agency only initiated the investigation\nafter it learned of the appellant\u2019s contact with OIG.       Id. at 622. The facts as\nalleged by the appellant appear to support a reasonable belief that the agency was\nretaliating against him for his meeting with OIG. Such an action would be a\nviolation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(C), which makes it a prohibited personnel\npractice to retaliate against an employee for \u201ccooperating with or disclosing\ninformation to the Inspector General of an agency . . . in accordance with\napplicable provisions of law.\u201d Under the law in effect at the time of the events at\nissue in this case, it was a protected whistleblowing disclosure to disclose to the\n\f                                                                                  10\n\nInspector General of an agency \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(B)(i) (2012). 7   We therefore find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that his second OIG complaint constituted a protected\ndisclosure.\n      The appellant filed a third OIG complaint in early July 2012 seeking to\ncompel the agency to produce documents he had requested under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA).      IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 24, 459.          The agency\nacknowledged that it received the appellant\u2019s FOIA request on May 2, 2012, and\nhad not responded by May 31, 2012, as promised. IAF, Tab 113 at 8, 18. In\nresponse to inquiries from OIG about the status of the appellant\u2019s request, the\nagency indicated on July 5, 2012, that the request was still under review.        Id.\nat 21. We therefore find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that, at the time\nhe filed his third OIG complaint, he reasonably believed that the agency was\nviolating FOIA by failing to timely respond to his request.\n      To satisfy the contributing factor criterion at the jurisdictional stage, an\nappellant only need raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of,\nthe protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action\nin any way. Ontivero v. Department of Homeland Security, 117 M.S.P.R. 600,\n\u00b6 21 (2012). One way to establish this criterion is the knowledge\/timing test,\nunder which an employee may nonfrivolously allege that the disclosure was a\ncontributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as\nevidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and\nthat the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable\nperson could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the\npersonnel action. Id. The Board has held that a personnel action taken within\n7\n  Section 101(a)(2) of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA),\nPub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465, amended 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(B)(i) to strike \u201ca\nviolation\u201d and insert \u201cany violation (other than a violation of this section).\u201d Thus,\nalthough disclosing a violation of section 2302 itself would not be a protected\ndisclosure under the WPEA, it was a protected disclosure under the pre-WPEA law we\nare applying here.\n\f                                                                                     11\n\napproximately 1 to 2 years of the appellant\u2019s disclosures satisfies the\nknowledge\/timing test.     Id., \u00b6 23.   We find that the appellant nonfrivolously\nalleged that his OIG disclosures were a contributing factor in at least some of the\nchallenged personnel actions.\n      In a June 12, 2012 memorandum, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat he would be loaned to work in another organization pending final action on\ninvestigations against him. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 633. In his memo, the\ncommander acknowledged \u201cmatters and complaints [the appellant] raised through\nInspector General channels at various levels of command.\u201d Id. This evidence is\nsufficient to establish that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the\ncommander was aware of his May 21 and 23 complaints to OIG. Accordingly, we\nfind that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his May 21 and 23 disclosures\nto OIG were a contributing factor in those personnel actions taking place on or\nafter June 12, 2012, which include the loan itself as well as the 7-day suspension\nand the curtailment of the appellant\u2019s overseas assignment. As to the appellant\u2019s\nFOIA disclosure, the agency submitted email traffic that shows that it was aware\nof the appellant\u2019s complaint shortly after it was filed. IAF, Tab 113 at 17-25.\nThus, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his FOIA disclosure\nwas a contributing factor in at least some of the challenged personnel actions,\nincluding the 7-day suspension and the curtailment of his overseas assignment.\nAccordingly, the appellant is entitled to have those claims of whistleblower\nreprisal adjudicated on the merits on remand. 8\n\n\n8\n  The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies as to several additional personnel actions, which she found were presented to\nOSC not as whistleblower reprisal, but as other prohibited personnel practices. ID at 9.\nOn review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should not have even\nincluded those personnel actions in her prehearing conference summary because he did\nnot ask for them to be adjudicated in this appeal. PFR File, Tab 1 at 24. Because the\nappellant has indicated that he does not wish to pursue those additional personnel\nactions in this IRA appeal, we need not review the administrative judge\u2019s determination\nthat those personnel actions were not exhausted before OSC.\n\f                                                                                    12\n\nThe administrative judge should consider the appellant\u2019s retaliatory investigation\nclaims further on remand.\n         The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to\nconsider alleged retaliatory investigations as personnel actions. PFR File, Tab 1\nat 7-8.    He cites the Board\u2019s holding in Russell v. Department of Justice,\n76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (1997), in support of this argument.           However, the\nBoard in Russell did not hold that investigations should be considered as separate\npersonnel actions. Rather, the Board held that it will consider evidence regarding\nthe conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely\nrelated to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering\nevidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity. Id. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s consideration of the agency\u2019s investigations in this case\nwas consistent with that holding.       ID at 13 (citing Wadhwa v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 111 M.S.P.R. 26, \u00b6 9, aff\u2019d, 353 F. App\u2019x 434 (Fed. Cir. 2009),\noverruled on other grounds by Hau v. Department of Homeland Security,\n123 M.S.P.R. 620, \u00b6 16 (2016), aff\u2019d sub nom. Bryant v. Merit Systems Protection\nBoard, 878 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).\n         Nevertheless, we find that the administrative judge should consider on\nremand whether the appellant\u2019s claims regarding agency investigations are\nactionable in light of Board decisions issued since the initial decision in this case.\nSpecifically, the Board clarified that, although an investigation is not a personnel\naction per se, an investigation can qualify as a personnel action in an IRA appeal\nif it amounts to a significant change in job duties, responsibilities, or working\nconditions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). Spivey v. Department of Justice,\n2022 MSPB 24, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. The Board also clarified that only agency actions that,\nindividually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall\nnature     and   quality   of   an   employee\u2019s   working   conditions,   duties,   or\nresponsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by\nsection 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).     Skarada, 2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 16.        On remand, the\n\f                                                                                  13\n\nadministrative judge should consider whether the appellant can establish an\nadditional personnel action under the standard set forth in Spivey and Skarada.\n\nThe appellant\u2019s remaining arguments have not established adjudicatory error.\n        The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred by failing to\naddress a grievance he filed. PFR File, Tab 1 at 8. To the extent the appellant is\narguing that the administrative judge should have adjudicated the grievance as a\nseparate personnel action, we find that the grievance was not among the personnel\nactions identified by the appellant in his initial appeal. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I\nat 5.    Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge\u2019s failure to\nadjudicate the grievance as an independent personnel action.\n        The appellant raises a number of arguments on petition for review relating\nto discovery. PFR File, Tab 1 at 24-27. In addition to challenging several of the\nadministrative judges\u2019 actions, the appellant argues more broadly that both\nadministrative judges assigned to the appeal demonstrated bias against him in\ntheir procedural and discovery rulings. Id.\n        In making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a\nparty must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies\nadministrative adjudicators. Oliver v. Department of Transportation, 1 M.S.P.R.\n382, 386 (1980). An administrative judge\u2019s conduct during the course of a Board\nproceeding warrants a new adjudication only if her comments or actions evidence\n\u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment\nimpossible.\u201d Bieber v. Department of the Army, 287 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed.\nCir. 2002) (quoting Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994)); Scoggins\nv. Department of the Army, 123 M.S.P.R. 592, \u00b6 19 (2016). None of the rulings\nor actions cited by the appellant are sufficient to overcome the presumption of\nhonesty and integrity, nor do they evidence a deep-seated favoritism or\nantagonism on the part of either administrative judge. We therefore find that the\nappellant has failed to establish administrative judge bias.\n\f                                                                                 14\n\n      Putting aside the issue of bias, we next turn to the specific discovery\nmatters raised by the appellant on petition for review. An administrative judge\nhas broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters, and absent an abuse of\ndiscretion, the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings. E.g., Kingsley\nv. U.S. Postal Service, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, \u00b6 16 (2016). For the reasons set forth\nbelow, we find that the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge\ncommitted any reversible error regarding discovery.\n      First, the appellant challenges the administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions he sought to take. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25. Specifically, the appellant\nsought an order from the administrative judge not only requiring that depositions\ntake place, but also authorizing the appellant to record those depositions himself\nrather than hiring a court reporter to record or transcribe them. IAF, Tab 56 at 5.\nThe administrative judge informed the appellant that he could conduct\ndepositions \u201ceither in the presence of a certified court reporter or upon written\nquestions.\u201d   IAF, Tab 61 at 2.     The appellant moved for certification of an\ninterlocutory appeal regarding his request to self-record depositions, IAF, Tab 65,\nbut the administrative judge denied that motion, IAF, Tab 66. In denying the\nappellant\u2019s motion, the administrative judge explained that the appellant was free\nto interview witnesses without a court reporter present, but that any audio\nrecording or \u201cunqualified transcription\u201d of such interviews would not be\nadmissible.   IAF, Tab 66 at 2.     The administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions are consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 28(a) (limiting the individuals before whom a deposition may be taken),\nwhich may be used as a general guide for discovery practices in Board\nproceedings, see Special Counsel v. Zimmerman, 36 M.S.P.R. 274, 286 (1988).\nWe therefore find no abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s rulings\nregarding depositions. We also agree with her determination that the criteria for\ncertifying an interlocutory appeal were not met. See Robinson v. Department of\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nthe Army, 50 M.S.P.R. 412, 418 (1991); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.92 (setting forth the\ncriteria for certification of an interlocutory appeal).\n       The appellant also argues that the administrative judge improperly delayed\nher ruling on the agency\u2019s assertion of the deliberative process privilege and that\nshe otherwise erred in failing to compel discovery or sanction the agency for its\ninadequate discovery responses. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25-26. However, we find\nthat he has not shown any abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s\nhandling of discovery matters. Because we are remanding this appeal for further\nadjudication, we need not address the appellant\u2019s arguments challenging the\nadministrative judge\u2019s findings on the merits of his whistleblower reprisal claims.\n\n                                       ORDER\n       For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the regional office\nfor further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.                 The\nadministrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing on remand if he requests\none.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                          ______________________________\n                                        Jennifer Everling\n                                        Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f","[Cite as Wilkinson v.

For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                                                                        -2-\n\n\n\n\n                          I.     Facts and Procedural Background\n\n       {\u00b6 2} This case arises from the shooting deaths of Aisha Nelson and her minor\n\ndaughter Harper Guynn. Because this case was resolved upon a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss, the facts are gleaned from the allegations as set forth in the complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At the time of the shooting, Nelson and Guynn resided at 337 Burleigh\n\nAvenue in Dayton. Waverly \u201cDante\u201d Hawes, with whom Nelson was in a relationship,\n\nalso resided at that address.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} During the evening hours of June 22, 2022, Nelson contacted the Dayton\n\nPolice Department and reported that Hawes had \u201cthreatened her life.\u201d She asked the\n\ndispatcher to have officers meet her at a nearby store \u201cso as not to arouse Hawes\u2019\n\nsuspicions.\u201d   \u201cAfter waiting for some time,\u201d Nelson again called the Dayton Police\n\nDepartment and stated that \u201cshe had seen several police cars, [but] none of them had\n\nstopped. She had her daughter in the vehicle[,] and it was late at night so she advised\n\nthat she was going to go home and would make a report the next day.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 5} During the early morning hours of June 23, 2022, \u201cHawes called police to the\n\nhome on Burleigh and stated he wanted [Nelson] to leave.\u201d Dayton Police Department\n\nOfficers Kathryn Santos and Terrell Moore responded to the residence and spoke with\n\nboth Hawes and Nelson. During her interview, Nelson \u201cinformed Santos that Hawes had\n\nmade multiple threats to her life and that there was a weapon in the house that Hawes\n\nhad easy access to.\u201d She further stated that Hawes had repeatedly \u201cbrandish[ed] a gun\u201d\n\nand \u201cthreatened violence against [her]\u201d in the presence of Guynn and Hawes\u2019s own\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\ndaughter. Nelson stated \u201cthat Hawes was like a \u2018[l]ion in a concrete jungle in here, but\n\nit\u2019s like he locked himself in that basement. He\u2019s down in that basement with his gun\n\nrocking in recliner [sic] back and forth.\u201d Nelson further stated that Hawes had \u201ccut up her\n\ncredit cards and emptied her accounts leaving her with no option of anywhere to go.\u201d\n\nNelson asked the officers to remove Hawes from the home.\n\n      {\u00b6 6} Moore and Santos left the residence at approximately 2:35 a.m. without\n\nmaking an arrest or \u201ctaking a formal report.\u201d At some point between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00\n\na.m., Hawes fatally shot both Nelson and Guynn. Hawes fled the scene, but he was later\n\nfound dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n      {\u00b6 7} Patricia Wilkinson was appointed administrator of the estates of Nelson and\n\nGuynn. Wilkinson filed this action on December 5, 2022. She filed a first amended\n\ncomplaint the following day.     The suit named the City of Dayton, the Dayton City\n\nCommission, the City of Dayton Commissioners, the Dayton Chief of Police, and Officers\n\nMoore and Santos as defendants. The suit also named \u201cJohn and\/or Jane Doe(s) 1-10\n\nindividually and as agents of the City of Dayton\u201d as defendants.\n\n      {\u00b6 8} On March 6, 2023, Santos and Moore filed a joint motion to dismiss. The\n\nother defendants also filed motions to dismiss. On April 12, 2023, Wilkinson filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a second amended complaint along with the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint. On April 14, 2023, she filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to\n\ndismiss filed by Moore and Santos. On April 17, 2023, she voluntarily dismissed her\n\nclaims against all defendants except Moore and Santos.\n\n      {\u00b6 9} On May 5, 2023, the trial court granted Moore and Santos\u2019s motion and\n\f                                                                                         -4-\n\n\ndismissed all pending claims against them. The trial court also overruled Wilkinson\u2019s\n\nmotion for leave to file a seconded amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Wilkinson appeals.\n\n\n\n                           II.

Petition for Discovery\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Wilkinson\u2019s first cause of action, which seeks the production of certain\n\ndocuments, is labeled as a \u201cPetition for Discovery Against Defendants City, Commission,\n\nand Afzal [the police chief].\u201d Wilkinson does not state whether she relies on Civ.R. 34(D)\n\nor R.C. 2317.48 as authority for the petition. Thus, we must examine both in determining\n\nwhether the decision to dismiss was appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} R.C. 2317.48 states, in part:\n\f                                                                                       -6-\n\n\n      When a person claiming to have a cause of action or a defense to an action\n\n      commenced against him, without the discovery of a fact from the adverse\n\n      party, is unable to file his complaint or answer, he may bring an action for\n\n      discovery, setting forth in his complaint in the action for discovery the\n\n      necessity and the grounds for the action, with any interrogatories relating to\n\n      the subject matter of the discovery that are necessary to procure the\n\n      discovery sought. * * *\n\n      {\u00b6 17} The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that an \u201caction for discovery\n\npursuant to R.C. 2317.48 is limited solely to interrogatories specifically concerning the\n\nfacts necessary to the complaint or answer * * *.\u201d Riverview Health Inst., L.L.C. v.

R.C. 2317.48 does not apply to a request for production of documents.\n\nRiverview at \u00b6 18.

Civil Liability for Criminal Offenses \u2013 R.C. 2307.60\n\n       {\u00b6 28} For her sixth cause of action, Wilkinson asserted an entitlement to damages\n\nas provided in R.C. 2307.60. That statute \u201cindependently authorize[s] a civil action for\n\ndamages caused by criminal acts, unless otherwise prohibited by law[.]\u201d Jacobson v.\n\nKaforey, 149 Ohio St.3d 398, 2016-Ohio-8434, 75 N.E.3d 203, \u00b6 6. 10. In pertinent part,\n\nthe statute states:\n\n       Anyone injured in person or property by a criminal act has, and may recover\n\n       full damages in, a civil action unless specifically excepted by law, may\n\n       recover the costs of maintaining the civil action and attorney's fees if\n\n       authorized by any provision of the Rules of Civil Procedure or another\n\n       section of the Revised Code or under the common law of this state, and\n\n       may recover punitive or exemplary damages if authorized by section\n\n       2315.21 or another section of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 29} In the first amended complaint, Wilkerson asserted that Moore and Santos\n\nwere guilty of the crime of dereliction of duty as proscribed by R.C. 2921.44. Specifically,\n\nthat complaint cited R.C. 2921.44(E), which states that \u201c[n]o public servant shall\n\nrecklessly fail to perform a duty expressly imposed by law with respect to the public\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nservant\u2019s office, or recklessly do any act expressly forbidden by law with respect to the\n\npublic servant\u2019s office.\u201d The first amended complaint then asserted that Santos and\n\nMoore \u201cwantonly, willfully, intentionally, maliciously, and not in good faith failed to perform\n\ntheir duties * * *,\u201d and that this failure was \u201ca crime under R.C. 2921.44(F).\u201d From this,\n\nthe first amended complaint asserted a right to recovery under R.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 30} In their motion to dismiss, Santos and Moore argued that, to avoid a Civ.R.\n\n12(B)(6) dismissal, Wilkerson had to \u201cidentify a duty expressly imposed by law on * * *\n\nSantos and Moore, the violation of which caused injury.\u201d Santos and Moore then argued\n\nthat, if the first amended complaint asserted that they had a duty to arrest Hawes for\n\ndomestic violence under R.C. 2935.032, this assertion was incorrect because R.C.\n\n2935.032 \u201conly impose[s] an arrest obligation if an officer determine[s] that an offender\n\n[has] committed felonious assault or aggravated assault\u201d; the first amended complaint did\n\nnot contain this allegation.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} The trial court determined that the sixth cause of action was subject to\n\ndismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), reasoning that R.C. 2921.44(E) requires the underlying\n\nstatute \u201cto expressly impose a duty upon the accused; an implied duty is therefore\n\ninsufficient to support a charge of dereliction of duty.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Then, the trial\n\ncourt concluded:\n\n       [Wilkinson] argue[s] [Santos and Moore] had a duty to arrest [Hawes] and\/or\n\n       remove him from the premises but fail[s] to point to a duty expressly\n\n       imposed by law. Instead, [Wilkinson] * * * mis-cite[s] laws not imposing an\n\f                                                                                         -12-\n\n\n       express duty to arrest or remove and * * * guideline policies3 created by [the\n\n       Dayton Police Department] which, by their very nature, do not require arrest\n\n       and removal. Therefore, [Wilkinson\u2019s] sixth cause of action is dismissed.\n\n(Emphasis sic.) (Footnote added.)\n\n       {\u00b6 32} We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Based upon the facts set forth\n\nin the first amended complaint, neither the domestic violence statute nor the Dayton\n\nPolice Department domestic violence guidelines imposed an express duty upon Officers\n\nSantos and Moore to arrest Hawes, to remove him from the premises, or to take any other\n\naction. Instead, both the statue and the guidelines state that, under certain circumstances,\n\nan arrest is the \u201cpreferred course of action.\u201d This language clearly gives the officers\n\nsome degree of discretion in determining whether to make an arrest, and thus cannot be\n\nconsidered an express legal duty. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing the sixth cause of action.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Wilkinson also claims the trial court erred in dismissing this cause of action\n\nbecause another section of R.C. 2921.44 provided a basis for liability. Specifically, she\n\nargues that under R.C. 2921.44(A), a law enforcement officer commits the crime of\n\ndereliction of duty when he or she negligently \u201c[f]ail[s] to prevent or halt the commission\n\nof an offense or to apprehend an offender, when it is in the law enforcement officer's\n\npower to do so alone or with available assistance.\u201d         Wilkinson contends that this\n\nprovision made the officers\u2019 failure to take action against Hawes a crime.\n\n\n\n3\n Dayton Police Department General Order 2.01-2, which articulates the department\u2019s\ndomestic violence response guidelines, was attached to the first amended complaint as\nExhibit 2.\n\f                                                                                          -13-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 34} However, this argument was not raised by Wilkinson at any time in the trial\n\ncourt. Indeed, she raised it for the first time in her appellate reply brief. \u201c[A]rguments\n\nraised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by an appellate court.\u201d Budz v.\n\nSomerfield, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 29550, 2023-Ohio-155, \u00b6 30, citing Powell v.\n\nCleveland, 2022-Ohio-4286, 202 N.E.3d 794, \u00b6 53 (8th Dist.). The rationale for this\n\nconclusion is that a party should not be \u201cgiven a second chance to raise arguments that\n\nthey should have raised below.\u201d Id., citing Hamper v. Suburban Umpires Assn., Inc., 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 92505, 2009-Ohio-5376, \u00b6 27, quoting Perlmutter v. People's Jewelry\n\nCo., 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-04-1271, 2005-Ohio-5031, \u00b6 29.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Wilkinson attempts to evade a finding of waiver by arguing that, because\n\nOhio is a notice pleading state, her general citation to R.C. 2921.44 was sufficient to place\n\nthe defendants on notice of her claims under R.C. 2921.44(A). We disagree. While\n\nWilkinson\u2019s complaint did make a general reference to R.C. 2921.44, the pleadings\n\nspecifically relied upon subsection (E) as the basis for her right to relief. Furthermore, in\n\ntheir motion to dismiss, consistent with the content of the first amended complaint, Moore\n\nand Santos exclusively argued that subsection (E) did not create liability. If Wilkinson\n\nintended to rely upon a different or additional section of R.C. 2921.44, she had an\n\nobligation to make that argument in her motion in opposition to the motion to dismiss so\n\nthat the trial court could have considered the claim. See Budz at \u00b6 31 (\u201cif the nonmoving\n\nparty fails to raise an issue when responding to the moving party's motion for summary\n\njudgment, the nonmoving party has waived that issue on appeal.\u201d) Accord Tchankpa v.\n\nAscena Retail Group, Inc., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 19AP-760, 2020-Ohio-3291, \u00b6 20\n\f                                                                                           -14-\n\n\n(failure to raise an argument in response to a motion for summary judgment waives the\n\nargument for purposes of appeal). Because Wilkinson failed to raise this argument in\n\nthe trial court, we will not consider it. Again, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision\n\nto dismiss the sixth cause of action alleging civil liability for criminal actions.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} Based upon the record before us, we find Wilkinson\u2019s arguments regarding\n\nthe trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss lack merit. Accordingly, the first assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n\n\n                III.   Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint\n\n       {\u00b6 37} Wilkinson\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:\n\n                THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY OVERRULING APPELLANTS\u2019\n\n       MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} Wilkinson contends the trial court erred by denying her request for leave to\n\nfile a second amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Civ.R. 15(A) provides that a party may amend its pleading once as a matter\n\nof course within 28 days after serving it or within 28 days after service of a Civ.R. 12(B)\n\nmotion, whichever comes first. Absent compliance with these deadlines, a party may\n\namend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or after obtaining leave\n\nof court.   Civ.R. 15(A).     As to amendments requiring leave of court, Civ.R. 15(A)\n\ndemands that \u201c[l]eave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d However,\n\na trial court may properly refuse to grant leave to amend when the amendment would be\n\nfutile.

The second amended\n\ncomplaint also did not state any new theories for civil recovery under R.C. 2307.60.\n\nInstead, it relied upon the same claim of dereliction of duty, R.C. 2921.44(E), and did not\n\f                                                                                    -16-\n\n\nadd a claim for dereliction of duty under R.C. 2921.44(A).\n\n       {\u00b6 43} From our review of the record, we conclude the trial court did not err by\n\ndenying Wilkinson\u2019s request to file a second amended complaint.\n\n\n\n                                      IV.

Schwartz, on the brief).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      Defendant appeals from two orders following a bench trial and argues it\n\ndid not have an obligation to continue to pay condominium association dues\n\nbecause plaintiff breached a 2016 settlement agreement by not making repairs\n\nto defendant's units. Defendant also challenges the attorneys' fee award. We\n\nconclude the settlement agreement between the parties did not give defendant\n\nthe right to withhold payment of condominium association dues and affirm the\n\ntrial court's order. We also affirm the award of attorney's fees.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      Empress House is overseen by the Empress House Condominium\n\nAssociation (the Association), a non-profit organization. The complex consists\n\nof 150 residential units and two commercial units.            According to the\n\nAssociation's Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions and bylaws, the size of\n\nthe unit, the percentage of interest in the common elements of Empress House,\n\nand the amount of Association dues all correlate \u2013 the larger the unit the greater\n\nthe association fee. These fees are used by the Association as the annual\n\noperating budget for Empress House, including payment of utilities,\n\nmaintenance and repair of common areas, and staff payroll.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        2\n\f      In March 2013, Turn Bright at Paterson LLC (Turn Bright) purchased the\n\ntwo commercial units for $145,000 and immediately rented out both units to a\n\nchildcare center. By the time of trial, several childcare centers had occupied the\n\nspaces, although they all had difficulty meeting the rental payments.\n\n      The units had historically experienced water issues, including pipe\n\ncondensation and broken or leaky pipes. In the summertime, the pipes above\n\nthe commercial units sweat, condensate, and water drips to the lowest level of\n\nthe building, where the two units were located, causing ceiling leaks. Defendant\n\nwas aware of heating and plumbing issues in the commercial units prior to its\n\npurchase. Despite renovations in March of 2013, water damage persisted in the\n\nform of leaks and floods. Flooding also occurred due to an exterior sewer\n\nbackup. Turn Bright's owner believed the Association was not upholding its\n\nresponsibilities due to the worsening condition of the premises. As a result, Turn\n\nBright stopped paying the monthly Association dues.\n\n      In 2014, Turn Bright sued the Association, alleging it had breached its\n\nduty to maintain and repair the premises. The 2014 litigation was eventually\n\nresolved in a March 18, 2016 Stipulation of Settlement (the 2016 Settlement\n\nAgreement), which was intended to serve as a \"clean-slate\" between the parties.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, Turn Bright agreed to pay the Association five\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        3\n\fmonths' worth of condominium association dues. This effectively resulted in\n\n$97,000 in unpaid dues being forgiven by the Association.\n\n      Turn Bright also agreed to pay all future monthly Association dues\n\nstarting April 1, 2016. These payments were to be made through an \"auto -pay\"\n\nservice.   The Association agreed to earmark $1,000 per month from the\n\nAssociation dues paid by Turn Bright to make repairs to the commercial units.\n\nThe money could be used to repair or prevent future damage to any type of\n\npiping in the ceiling of the units. However, the reserved money was not to be\n\nused for repairs that would ordinarily be considered the burden of the owner.\n\nThere was no agreement between the parties as to which party would oversee or\n\npay for specific repairs.\n\n      The 2016 Settlement Agreement was in force for a 48-month period, from\n\nthe effective date of November 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. In the event either\n\nparty defaulted on any of the material terms of the agreement, the other party\n\nwas entitled to refile the lawsuit claiming funds that may still be due.\n\n      The leaks continued, and in August of 2016 Turn Bright stopped making\n\nits required payments of Association dues. Turn Bright made a few sporadic\n\npayments in September 2017, November 2017, and June 2018 but made no\n\npayments in the intervening months and the following years. As of January 4,\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        4\n\f2021, Turn Bright owed the Association a total of $163,425.27 in unpaid\n\nAssociation dues.\n\n      In January 2017, the Association spent $11,008.13 to make a few interim\n\nrepairs but notified Turn Bright it was awaiting payment of its 2017 dues to\n\nmake further repairs. Turn Bright did not send the funds, and claimed the\n\nproposed work was not the subject of the 2016 Settlement Agreement. The\n\nAssociation continued to make sporadic repairs, including an evaluation of a\n\nblockage and cleaning of the commercial units' sewer line.\n\n      On November 2, 2018, the Association filed a complaint against Turn\n\nBright, seeking payment of the unpaid Association dues. A five-day bench trial\n\nwas conducted. A representative of the Association testified it could not make\n\nthe capital improvements necessary because Turn Bright did not provide\n\nadequate funds. In response, the owner of Turn Bright testified, given the\n\ncontinuation of the water damage, it \"did not have any other legal remedies but\n\nto stop payment.\" Further, he explained that while Turn Bright received rental\n\npayments from March 2016 to April 2019 for one of the units, it was unable to\n\nrent the other unit due to water damage.\n\n      The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Association. It found\n\n\"[t]here [was] no question that there ha[d] been an ongoing problem of water\n\n\n                                                                        A-2049-21\n                                       5\n\finfiltration\" in the two commercial units. It also found the Association's efforts\n\nto rectify the sewer backups, overflows from heavy rainstorms, and clogged\n\ndrains were \"reasonable.\" However, the Association's efforts to respond to and\n\nrepair the condensation-related water issues were \"woefully deficient.\" The\n\ncourt noted the 2016 Settlement Agreement was not specific as to the agreed to\n\nrepairs, when they needed to be completed, or which party was responsible for\n\noverseeing the repairs. Nevertheless, the court explained that water infiltration\n\ncaused by condensation was clearly an issue and the Association's efforts to\n\nrepair the issue had been \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\n      Although the court was critical of the way the Association ran its business,\n\nit determined Turn Bright took advantage of the Association to try \"to evade its\n\nobligations to pay common area maintenance charges.\" It found the Association\n\nwas entitled to recover the unpaid association charges and rejected Turn Bright's\n\nargument that plaintiff was not entitled to association charges pursuant to the\n\ntheory of unclean hands. According to the court, \"[a] unit owner's obligations\n\nto pay common expenses is unconditional.\"\n\n      The court also rejected Turn Bright's contention its damages should be\n\noffset by $168,884.35 for lost rental income. The court found insufficient\n\nevidence to demonstrate the condition of the premises impacted the ability to\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        6\n\frent the space. Instead, it found Turn Bright made no effort to mitigate its\n\ndamages, by either fixing the leaks itself, or attempting to collect rent from or\n\nevicting its non-paying tenants. The court characterized this failure to mitigate\n\nas \"a calculated effort to obtain a windfall similar to what [Turn Bright] did in\n\nthe 2014 suit,\" rejected Turn Bright's counterclaim for offset damages, and\n\nentered a judgment in the amount of $159,151.27 in favor of the Association.\n\n      According to the Association's bylaws, the Board of the Association had\n\nthe right to charge interest on association fees not timely paid. The Board could\n\nalso charge a sum for reasonable counsel fees. Therefore, the court allowed the\n\nAssociation to submit an affidavit detailing the attorneys' fees it had incurred.\n\n      The court determined there was no legal justification for Turn Bright to\n\nhave stopped paying its Association dues and plaintiff was entitled to an award\n\nof attorneys' fees pursuant to its master deed and bylaws. The court noted Turn\n\nBright did not dispute the reasonableness of the attorneys' rate, but rather the\n\naward of fees. Plaintiff's attorneys billed a total of $31,350. After it considered\n\nthe fees \"it deem[ed] necessary for the prosecution of [plaintiff's] case in chief,\"\n\nthe court awarded plaintiff $20,728 in reasonable fees.\n\n      Defendant appeals from both the February 28, 2021 order finding Turn\n\nBright liable in the amount of $159,151.27 for unpaid dues and the March 10,\n\n\n                                                                             A-2049-21\n                                         7\n\f2021 order finding Turn Bright liable for $20,728 in attorneys ' fees. It argues\n\nthe trial court erred by awarding plaintiff all the association fees and charges\n\ndespite finding plaintiff breached its own obligations pursuant to the parties\u2019\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement and failed to apply the governing agreement in its\n\ncalculation of damages owed to the Association. It also argues the trial court\n\nerred in awarding $20,325 in attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff. We disagree and affirm\n\nboth of the trial court's orders.\n\n                                       II.\n\n      Appellate courts review a \"trial court's determinations, premised on the\n\ntestimony of witnesses and written evidence at a bench trial,\" pursuant to a\n\ndeferential standard.

Lee\n\nHo, 120 N.J. 465, 472 (1990)).\n\n      Both parties signed the 2016 \"Stipulation of Settlement\" where the\n\nAssociation agreed to forgive approximately $97,000 in outstanding dues. The\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement was intended by the parties to represent a \"clean\n\nslate.\"\n\n      Pursuant to general contract principles, if one party commits a \"breach of\n\na material term of an agreement, the non-breaching party is relieved of its\n\nobligations under the agreement.\" Roach v. BM Motoring, LLC, 228 N.J. 163,\n\n174 (2017) (quoting Nolan, 120 N.J. at 472). \"[A] breach is material if it 'goes\n\nto the essence of the contract.'\" Ibid. (quoting Ross Sys. v. Linden Dari-Delite,\n\nInc., 35 N.J. 329, 341 (1961)).\n\n\n                                                                          A-2049-21\n                                       9\n\f      Turn Bright argues the Association's failure to adequately repair the\n\ncondensation leak issue constituted a material breach, which entitled Turn\n\nBright to withhold payment of Association dues. The trial court found the\n\nAssociation's failure to repair the condensation leak issue in a timely manner\n\nconstituted a \"breach\" of the agreement. However, it also held that even if the\n\nAssociation breached the 2016 Settlement Agreement, the agreement did not\n\nallow Turn Bright to stop payment of Association dues. We agree.\n\n      Turn Bright cannot point to any language in the agreement that provided\n\nthat remedy. Turn Bright could have sued the Association for breach of the\n\nagreement, but it did not. Instead, it stopped making payments of Association\n\ndues in August 2016, soon after the agreement was reached. In the agreement\n\nthe Association agreed to \"reserve\" $1,000 per month from Turn Bright's\n\nmonthly dues \"for the purpose of making repairs.\" The Association eventually\n\ncompleted the repairs to resolve the condensation leak issue in May 2020,\n\ndespite Turn Bright's failure to pay Association dues.\n\n      Even if the Association's failure to fix the condensation leak issue by\n\nAugust 2016 amounted to a \"material breach,\" which the trial court did not find,\n\nTurn Bright would not have been permitted to withhold Association dues\n\nbecause the 2016 Settlement Agreement did not expressly allow that remedy.\n\n\n                                                                         A-2049-21\n                                      10\n\fPlaintiff has not pointed to any language in the agreement that would absolve it\n\nof its obligation to make those payments pursuant to the New Jersey\n\nCondominium Act (the Condominium Act). N.J.S.A. 46:8B-1 to -38. In the\n\nabsence of such a contractual provision, we agree with the trial court that the\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement did not afford Turn Bright the right to stop paying\n\nAssociation dues for breach of the agreement. See E. Brunswick Sewerage\n\nAuth. v. E. Mill Assocs., Inc., 365 N.J. Super. 120, 125, 838 A.2d 494, 497\n\n(App. Div. 2004) (citing Washington Const. Co. v. Spinella, 8 N.J. 212, 217\n\n(1951) (explaining \"the court will not make a different or a better contract than\n\nthe parties themselves have seen fit to enter into\")).\n\n      Generally, \"[a] unit owner's obligation to pay common expenses is\n\nunconditional.\" Glen v. June 344 N.J. Super. 371, 377 (App. Div. 2001) (citing\n\nN.J.S.A. 46:8B-17). However, a unit owner may be entitled to damages, as\n\n\"measured by the reasonable value of the loss of use . . . for the period he was\n\ndeprived thereof,\" to be \"set off\" against his outstanding fees. Id. at 380. Turn\n\nBright argues Glen is inapposite because that case involved only the\n\nCondominium Act, whereas Turn Bright's obligation to continue paying\n\nassociation dues arose pursuant to the 2016 Settlement Agreement.             We\n\ndisagree. Turn Bright's obligation to pay Association fees stems from the master\n\n\n                                                                          A-2049-21\n                                       11\n\fdeed and bylaws, not the 2016 Settlement Agreement. Although the agreement\n\nforgave a portion of past dues, it did not address the payment of future fees\n\nexcept to acknowledge that Turn Bright would resume paying dues upon the\n\nexecution of the agreement. That obligation exists by virtue of its ownership of\n\nthe condominium units. Plaintiff's alleged breach of a material term of an\n\nagreement does not relieve defendant of his unconditional obligation to pay\n\nfuture dues.\n\n      Turn Bright had an obligation to continue paying its Association dues, and\n\nbreached its obligation when it stopped making payments in August 2016. The\n\nAssociation's failure to rectify the leakage problems, at least by the time Turn\n\nBright stopped paying its dues, was not a breach of the express terms of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, and, even if it was, Turn Bright would not have been\n\nentitled to withhold payment of Association dues.\n\n      B. The Counterclaim for an offset for damages.\n\n      We also find adequate, credible evidence in the record to support the trial\n\ncourt's determination that Turn Bright did not take reasonable steps to mitigate\n\nits damages by attempting to evict or collect rent from its tenants. We, therefore,\n\naffirm the court's denial of an offset on defendant's counterclaim. In Glen, we\n\nexplained the appropriate remedy available to a unit owner who has suffered\n\n\n                                                                            A-2049-21\n                                       12\n\fdamages as a result of a condominium association's breach. 344 N.J. Super. at\n\n380-81.\n\n      Turn Bright asserted it was entitled to offset $168,884.35 from the damage\n\naward due to lost rental income resulting from the Association's breach of its\n\nobligations. The trial court found defendant did not meet its burden in proving\n\nit took reasonable steps to mitigate damages.       There is sufficient credible\n\nevidence in the record to support the trial court's finding, including the lack of\n\nany effort by Turn Bright to evict its non-paying tenants or pay Association dues\n\ndespite collecting rent on one of the two units.\n\n      C. The Attorneys' Fees.\n\n      Appellate courts review an award of attorney's fees for abuse of discretion.\n\nNoren v. Heartland Payment Sys., Inc., 448 N.J. Super. 486, 497 (App. Div.\n\n2017). Determinations regarding attorney's fees will be disturbed \"only on the\n\nrarest of occasions, and then only because of a clear abuse of discretion.\" Litton\n\nIndus., Inc. v. IMO Indus., Inc., 200 N.J. 372, 386 (2009) (quoting Packard-\n\nBamberger & Co. v. Collier, 167 N.J. 427, 444 (2001)).\n\n      New Jersey follows the American Rule: a prevailing party is entitled to\n\nattorney's fees only if it is authorized by the parties' contract, court rule, or\n\nstatute. Litton Indus., 200 N.J. at 385 (quoting Packard-Bamberger, 167 N.J. at\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                       13\n\f444); id. at 404 (Rivera-Soto, J., concurring). The Condominium Act authorizes\n\nthe collection of \"reasonable attorney's fees imposed or incurred in the collection\n\nof [an] unpaid assessment.\" N.J.S.A. 46:8B-21(a). Additionally, section 11 of\n\nthe Association's bylaws authorizes the collection of \"reasonable counsel fees\"\n\nincurred in the collection of unpaid Association dues.\n\n      The court determined there was no legal justification for Turn Bright to\n\nhave stopped paying its Association dues and plaintiff was entitled to an award\n\nof attorneys' fees pursuant to its master deed and the bylaws. The court noted\n\nTurn Bright did not dispute the reasonableness of the rate or amount of plaintiff's\n\nattorneys' fees.

Plaintiff appeals from a December 10, 2021 order granting the\n\nsummary judgment motion of defendants Wingate Vineland, Roth 55\n\nDevelopment Corp., Edward Roth, and Henry Roth (collectively the\n\ndefendants), and a January 22, 2022 order denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration. We affirm.\n\n      The facts in this case are not in dispute. Plaintiff was employed by\n\nOsmose Utilities Services, Inc. as a technician and worked alongside his friend\n\nand roommate, Ivan Scott Strayer, at the time of Strayer's murder. Plaintiff,\n\nStrayer, and other utility workers were assigned to work crews and traveled to\n\nvarious locations around the country, living together in hotels while on\n\nassignment. According to plaintiff, the crew led by Mark Knowles had worked\n\non five to six different sites before October 2016. Plaintiff and Strayer had been\n\nhotel roommates on the prior ten to twelve work assignments.           They also\n\nsocialized frequently outside of work. Plaintiff was the best man at Strayer's\n\nwedding. Plaintiff considered Strayer family, knew his wife, and attended his\n\nfamily functions.\n\n      Approximately one month before Strayer's murder, plaintiff and other\n\nmembers of the Osmose work crew checked into the Wingate Hotel in Vineland.\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                        3\n\fKnowles always made their hotel reservations and took the lead in making their\n\nroom assignments. The crew, consisting of five crew members, checked into\n\nthe hotel together, and included plaintiff, Strayer, Knowles, Charles Pulcine\n\n(Chuck), and his brother Larry Pulcine (Larry), who had recently joined the\n\ncrew. Knowles spoke to the front desk clerk while the remaining crew members\n\nprovided their identification to the front desk clerk and \"wrote on some\n\ncard . . . who was in which room.\" The crew members were assigned to three\n\nrooms as follows: plaintiff and Strayer were assigned Room 404, the Pulcine\n\nbrothers were assigned Room 405, and Knowles was assigned Room 406.\n\n      On the evening of October 10, 2016, plaintiff had gone to Bennigan's\n\nRestaurant, located in front of the hotel, to eat dinner and watch a baseball game.\n\nHe went alone, but Strayer eventually met him at the restaurant. Strayer left the\n\nrestaurant and returned to the hotel between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. while plaintiff\n\nstayed to watch the end of the baseball game. When plaintiff returned to their\n\nhotel room around 10:00 p.m., he observed the television was on, and Strayer\n\nappeared to be sleeping. That same evening plaintiff received a text message\n\nfrom Chuck around 10:03 p.m. inviting him to hang out and drink some beers in\n\nhis room. At approximately 10:05 p.m., plaintiff went to the Pulcines' room,\n\nalthough he briefly returned to his room to grab a few beers. He did not make\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                        4\n\fany observations of Strayer at that time. He then returned to the Pulcines' room,\n\nwhere he stayed until approximately 11:30 p.m.\n\n      While plaintiff was in the Pulcines' room, Larry left for approximately\n\nthirty minutes, stating he was going to do laundry, and when he returned, Larry\n\nwas \"shooting his mouth off to [plaintiff] . . . [plaintiff] wasn't in a good mood[,]\n\nso [plaintiff] just left.\" When plaintiff finally returned to his room, he noticed\n\nthe television was off but did not make any observation of, or hear anything\n\nfrom, Strayer at that time and \"[w]ent to bed. . . . [and] didn't turn on the light\n\nor anything . . . .\"\n\n      On October 11, 2016, plaintiff woke up around 5:00 to 5:15 a.m. and\n\nStrayer was still in bed, which was unusual because Strayer \"was normally up\n\nbefore [plaintiff].\" Plaintiff said:\n\n                       [I] looked over and . . . saw [Strayer's],\n                       eyes were open, but he was not\u2014nothing\n                       really going on, you know. So I ran over,\n                       grabbed his foot. It was ice cold. And,\n                       then I went to\u2014I grabbed his arm and\n                       checked his pulse twice. I'll never forget\n                       the noise it made. And I . . . panicked so I\n                       ran out of the room. Went to Mark's\n                       room . . . told him what I saw . . . And, I []\n                       it was wild 'cause I mean, I didn't even\n                       think [] I didn't hear anything, didn't see\n                       any[.]\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                             5\n\fAccording to plaintiff, he felt shocked at finding his friend's body and fear for\n\nhis own safety. Plaintiff later learned Strayer had been shot with a handgun.\n\nPlaintiff did not witness the murder and did not encounter the murderer in his\n\nhotel room. He was not physically harmed.\n\n      Larry was taken into police custody after video surveillance from the\n\nhotel's front lobby area revealed that at approximately 10:00 p.m. on October\n\n10, 2016, the Pulcine brothers had entered the lobby and approached the front\n\ndesk. According to the police report, the front desk clerk on duty at the time\n\ncreated two keycards: one for room 404 and another for room 405 at around\n\n10:00 p.m. and Charles took possession of the keycards from the clerk.\n\nAccording to the keycard access log, the new keycard for Room 404 given to\n\nthe Pulcines was used to access Room 404 at 10:28 p.m. A responding police\n\ndetective estimated that Strayer was shot between 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\n\nwhile plaintiff was across the hall in Room 405.       Larry was subsequently\n\narrested for, charged with, and convicted of Strayer's murder.\n\n      Strayer's wife brought a wrongful death and survivorship action under\n\nN.J.S.A. 2A:31-2 and 2A:15-3 against defendants, while plaintiff brought a\n\nseparate action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Both matters were\n\nconsolidated and proceeded to discovery where the parties retained liability and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                       6\n\fmedical experts and took depositions. Strayer's wife's claims have since been\n\nsettled.\n\n      Plaintiff retained an expert on hotel management and operations and a\n\nmedical expert. His hotel management and operations expert, Kenneth Free,\n\nopined that \"the Wingate Hotel was aware of its safety obligations and deviated\n\nfrom the industry standard of care that created a foreseeable risk of harm to the\n\nhotel\u2019s guests.\" Free explained Larry's criminal acts are the type of criminal\n\nactivity that adequate safety and security measures are intended to prevent and\n\nwere, therefore, foreseeable. Free concluded that the failure to identify or\n\nproperly register the Osmose crew was inconsistent with proper keycard control\n\nand resulted in a foreseeable risk of harm to guests, and the implementation and\n\nenforcement of a proper keycard control protocol system could have prevented\n\nLarry's unauthorized entry into plaintiff's and Strayer\u2019s room.\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on October 7, 2021.               On\n\nDecember 10, 2021, the motion judge heard argument, after which he rendered\n\nhis decision from the bench. The motion judge found that plaintiff had failed to\n\ndemonstrate defendants' actions proximately caused plaintiff's emotional\n\ninjuries. He found plaintiff's injuries were \"not based upon the handing of a\n\nkeycard\" and that neither defendants nor their employees \"cause[d] any of the\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                        7\n\femotional distresses being suffered by plaintiff.\"        He acknowledged that\n\ndefendants' employee \"shouldn\u2019t have given the keycard to Mr. Pulcine\" but\n\nsubsequently concluded:\n\n            you know, they were all friends. They had been in the\n            hotel. They were seen together and all those things.\n            It\u2019s not like they gave the keycard to a stranger, but\n            putting that all aside, the Defendants here didn\u2019t cause,\n            whether negligently, intentionally or recklessly, any of\n            the emotional distress caused\u2014that Plaintiff is now\n            suffering from.\n\nIn his brief discussion of the law, the motion judge also relied on Falzone v.\n\nBusch, 45 N.J. 559, 561 (1965), to support his causation determination, stating:\n\n            when you come to emotional distress types of claims\n            as, you know, started in this road down with Falzone\n            and its been kind of muddled by subsequent cases, there\n            still has to be the requirement that the [d]efendants are\n            the ones that caused the emotional distress. And I think\n            that\u2019s clear -- made clear in the model jury charge under\n            3.30.f, that there has to -- it\u2019s the plain -- it\u2019s the\n            [d]efendants that have to be the cause of the emotional\n            distress. And I think that\u2019s really what Falzone talks\n            about at least initially, not directly, but I mean, I think\n            it\u2019s obviously inherent in it that it\u2019s the [d]efendants\n            that cause it.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n                                        I.\n\n      We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same\n\nstandard as the trial court. Samolyk v. Berthe, 251 N.J. 73, 78 (2022). That\n\n\n                                                                          A-0787-22\n                                        8\n\fstandard requires us to \"determine whether 'the pleadings, depositions, answers\n\nto interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.'\" Branch\n\nv.

Martinez, 242 N.J. 449, 472 (2020) (quoting Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)). We do not defer to the trial court's legal\n\nanalysis. RSI Bank v. Providence Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 234 N.J. 459, 472 (2018).\n\n        A. Bystander Claim for Negligent Infliction of Emotional\n           Distress.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff argues the motion judge erred by ruling that, as a\n\nmatter of law, plaintiff's emotional injuries were solely caused by the actions of\n\nLarry and that defendants' negligence did not cause his alleged injuries.\n\nAccording to plaintiff, the motion judge erroneously \"based [his] grant of\n\nsummary judgment entirely upon [his] determination that defendants' negligence\n\nin giving the keycard to [plaintiff's] hotel room to an unauthorized individual,\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                        9\n\fwho used the keycard to access the room and murder [Strayer], did not\n\nproximately cause any emotional distress to [plaintiff].\"\n\n      Plaintiff continues to assert, as he did at summary judgment, that this case\n\nis not a Portee v. Jaffee, 84 N.J. 88 (1980), bystander claim of negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress. Instead, he avers he is entitled to recover based\n\non a theory of direct negligence.\n\n      In Portee, our Supreme Court recognized a cause of action for the unique\n\nemotional distress suffered by a mother as she watched her seven-year-old son\n\ndie an excruciating death, trapped in a malfunctioning elevator shaft. 84 N.J. at\n\n91-92. Portee marked a pivotal development in the law, creating an exception\n\nthat allowed bystanders to recover damages for emotional injuries based on the\n\ntheory of negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Court considered the\n\nfacts that police attempted to rescue the child for four and a half hours, and the\n\nplaintiff had to endure witnessing her son \"moan, cr[y] out, and flail his arms.\"\n\nIbid. The plaintiff's son eventually died during the rescue attempt, and as a\n\nresult, the plaintiff \"became severely depressed and seriously self-destructive,\"\n\nculminating in an unsuccessful attempt to take her own life, which \"required\n\nconsiderable physical therapy and . . . [she] received extensive counseling and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                       10\n\fpsychotherapy to help overcome the mental and emotional problems caused by\n\nher son's death.\" Ibid.\n\n      Plaintiff disputes defendants' contention that the analysis set forth in\n\nPortee is applicable. Instead, he maintains defendants owed him a direct duty\n\nof care, the same duty of care that was owed to Strayer as a guest of the hotel,\n\nthere was a breach of the duty of care to him and Strayer, and that breach\n\nproximately caused him severe emotional distress.\n\n      Defendants frame this issue as one that must be analyzed pursuant to\n\nPortee. Confronted with a set of facts where a bystander suffered emotional\n\ndistress as a result of witnessing the death of her child, the Portee Court set forth\n\na four-factor test for bystander negligent infliction of emotional distress claims:\n\n\"(1) the death or serious physical injury of another caused by defendant's\n\nnegligence; (2) a marital or intimate, familial relationship between plaintiff and\n\nthe injured person; (3) observation of the death or injury at the scene of the\n\naccident; and (4) resulting severe emotional distress.\" Id. at 101. Defendants\n\nmaintain that plaintiff cannot satisfy an essential element of a Portee claim\n\nbecause plaintiff and Strayer lacked the requisite familial relationship, despite\n\ntheir personal friendship and plaintiff's claim that he considered Strayer family.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                        11\n\f      Defendants further note that our Supreme Court in McDougall v. Lamm\n\nreaffirmed Portee's narrow application to specified relationships, namely\n\n\"marital or intimate, familial relationship[s],\" when it denied the plaintiff\n\nrecovery for emotional distress suffered as result of witnessing the death of a\n\npet. 211 N.J. 203, 229 (2012). The Court emphasized that Portee claims have\n\nbeen limited to relationships with a \"plain and obvious emotional bond,\" such\n\nas between a \"parent, child, spouse, or an individual with whom one shares a\n\nmarital-like or intimate familial relationship[.]\" Ibid. Thus, defendants aver the\n\nrelationship between the co-workers here does not rise to the level required by\n\nPortee.\n\n      Although we recognize that the relationship between Strayer and plaintiff\n\nmay be more than that of mere co-workers, it does not rise to the level required\n\nby Portee, and we see no basis to relax the Supreme Court's requirement of a\n\n\"marital-like or intimate familial relationship.\" McDougall, 211 N.J. at 229.\n\nThus, plaintiff did not, and cannot, establish a claim under Portee for negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n          B. Direct Claim for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.\n\n      Plaintiff concedes he cannot sustain his burden under Portee, but argues\n\nthe court nonetheless erred in granting defendant summary judgment because he\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                       12\n\fhas a direct claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress based on\n\ndefendants' breach of a duty it owed directly to him. The argument ignores the\n\nlimited bases supporting a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Jablonowski v. Suther, held:\n\n            Generally, then, an individual can maintain an\n            independent tort action for negligent infliction of\n            emotional distress in two instances. A plaintiff can\n            demonstrate that the defendant's negligent conduct\n            placed the plaintiff in reasonable fear of immediate\n            personal injury, which gave rise to emotional distress\n            that resulted in a substantial bodily injury or sickness.\n            See Falzone, 45 N.J. at 569. Alternatively, a plaintiff\n            can state a prima facie claim for negligent infliction of\n            emotional distress by satisfying the four elements set\n            forth in Portee.\n\n            [195 N.J. 91, 104 (2008); accord Abousaid v. Mansard\n            Gardens Assocs., LLC, 207 N.J. 67, 76-77 (2011).]\n\n      Plaintiff contends he is entitled to recover damages based on a direct claim\n\nof negligent infliction of emotional distress that follows traditional negligence\n\nanalysis, which he claims \"can be understood as negligent conduct that is the\n\nproximate cause of emotional distress in a person to whom the actor owes a legal\n\nduty to exercise reasonable care.\" Russo v. Nagel, 358 N.J. Super. 254, 269-70\n\n(App. Div. 2003) (quoting Decker v. Princeton Packet, 116 N.J. 418, 429\n\n(1989)).\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                       13\n\f      Here, plaintiff relies on Falzone, 45 N.J. 559, Strachan v. John F. Kennedy\n\nMemorial Hospital, 109 N.J. 523 (1988), and Lascurian v. City of Newark, 349\n\nN.J. Super. 251, 277 (App. Div. 2002). He distinguishes these cases from the\n\nPortee line of cases, arguing that defendants owed a duty directly to him\u2014as a\n\nguest in their hotel\u2014that included not giving keycard access to his room to any\n\nother person.    Plaintiff argues that defendants, through their negligent\n\ndistribution of the keycard, breached a duty owed directly to him, and are\n\ntherefore liable for his emotional distress damages. Ibid.\n\n      Defendants argue that under Falzone's \"zone of danger\" test, 45 N.J. at\n\n569, plaintiff cannot show he was in imminent fear of harm. In Falzone, the\n\ndefendant-motorist's car struck the plaintiff's husband, who was standing in a\n\nfield as the plaintiff sat in her car, which was parked nearby. 45 N.J. at 561.\n\nThe plaintiff observed the oncoming car, although she was not physically struck\n\nor injured. The plaintiff's husband suffered serious injuries as a result of the\n\ncollision. The plaintiff filed suit, alleging negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress for having witnessed her husband's injuries and because she was also in\n\nfear of her own bodily injury as she witnessed the accident. The trial court\n\ngranted the defendant summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                      14\n\f      However, the Court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment\n\nto the defendant and held a plaintiff could recover for bodily injury or sickness\n\nresulting from fear for her own safety caused by a negligent defendant where\n\nshe was placed in danger by such negligence, although there was no physical\n\nimpact. Id. at 569.\n\n      By eschewing the \"prior inflexible requirement of physical impact,\"\n\nFalzone expanded the potential reach of liability for claims for emotional\n\ndistress \"where negligence causes fright from a reasonable fear of immediate\n\npersonal injury.\" Ibid.; see also Portee, 84 N.J. at 934. Plaintiff relies on the\n\nCourt's reasoning and holding in Falzone for the proposition that, like the\n\nplaintiff in Falzone, who the Court recognized had been equally \"fearful of\n\nimmediate injury\" because of her proximity to her husband when he was struck\n\nby the defendant's vehicle, he was in the zone of danger by virtue of sharing the\n\nsame hotel room and awaking to find the body of his murdered friend and co-\n\nworker.\n\n      Plaintiff also maintains that the Court's reasoning in Falzone is equally\n\napplicable here because although not physically injured, he suffered emotional\n\nharm by virtue of being fearful of immediate injury when he realized his\n\nroommate and friend was dead in the bed next to him. He, therefore, seeks\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                      15\n\freversal of the order granting summary judgment to defendants, arguing that\n\nunder Falzone, witnesses to harm suffered by others can establish liability on\n\nthe contention that they were \"fearful of immediate injury.\"\n\n      The problem with plaintiff's argument is that Falzone, as the Court\n\nrecognized in Portee, 84 N.J. at 93, Jablonowska, 195 N.J. at 104, and Abousaid,\n\n207 N.J. at 77, requires a plaintiff to demonstrate \"a reasonable fear of\n\nimmediate personal injury,\" Falzone, 45 N.J. at 569, and plaintiff has failed to\n\nmake that showing. Plaintiff understandably may have felt shock and even fear\n\nwhen he discovered his roommate's dead body, but the evidence in the record\n\ndoes not establish he had a \"reasonable fear of immediate personal injury.\" Ibid.\n\nTo the contrary, plaintiff testified he \"didn't even think . . . didn't hear anything,\n\ndidn't see any[thing]\" in the moments after he found Strayer's dead body in the\n\nhotel room.\n\n      As the record shows, plaintiff was not present when Strayer was murdered,\n\nplaintiff did not encounter the murderer in his hotel room, Strayer's body was\n\n\"ice cold\" when plaintiff touched it, and plaintiff was not even aware that Strayer\n\nhad been murdered until he was so advised by investigating officers later in the\n\nday. According to plaintiff's deposition testimony, when he returned to his room\n\nthe night of the murder, all the lights were off, and he \"used [his] phone light to\n\n\n                                                                                A-0787-22\n                                         16\n\fguide [him] to [his] bed so as to not disturb Strayer,\" whom he believed was\n\nsleeping. He then \"put [his] phone on the . . . nightstand and [he] crawl[ed] into\n\nbed\" to go to sleep. It was only when he awoke early the next morning that he\n\nsaw Strayer was still in bed and eventually realized that something was wrong.\n\nHe then \"ran up to him, grabbed his foot, leg\" and \"pushed his chest and checked\n\nhis pulse twice.\" And, once he realized Strayer was unresponsive, he testified,\n\n\"obviously, I didn't know what to do\" and \"didn't know what was [going] on\"\n\nand \"just\u2014ran out.\" Plaintiff also testified that it was his understanding when\n\nhe discovered Strayer's body that \"he had passed away[, but he] didn't know that\n\nhe was shot.\" A police officer called to the scene later told plaintiff, who was\n\nthen sitting in the hallway, that Strayer had been shot with a handgun. On these\n\nfacts, plaintiff has not demonstrated that he had a reasonable fear of any personal\n\ninjury, never mind the requisite \"reasonable fear of immediate personal injury.\"\n\nIbid. see also Jablonowski, 195 N.J. at 104.\n\n      Based upon these undisputed facts, we cannot conclude that the principles\n\nof liability addressed in Falzone support plaintiff's cause of action. We also\n\nconsider that based upon plaintiff's own testimony, for all he knew at the time,\n\nStayer could have died from natural causes. He was understandably distraught,\n\nconfused, and in shock, but those facts do not establish that he was in the zone\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                       17\n\fof danger or reasonably fearful of immediate harm, under the principles\n\nexplained in Falzone.1\n\n      Plaintiff concedes that he does not have a claim or cause of action under\n\nPortee, and we otherwise conclude he cannot sustain his burden of proving a\n\nPortee claim. We also find he cannot otherwise sustain the asserted negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress claim because he failed to present any evidence\n\nhe suffered a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury under Falzone. See\n\nFriedman v. Martinez, 242 N.J. 449, 472 (2020) (\"Summary judgment should be\n\ngranted . . .

Kelsey, appellant pro se.\n\n                   Adam M. Schneider, attorney for respondents.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n          Plaintiff appeals from the January 19, 2022 order denying his motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint which was dismissed without prejudice in June 2021.\n\fThe June 2021 order was issued sua sponte and stated if plaintiff did not file a\n\ncomplaint for guardianship, the dismissal would convert to a dismissal with\n\nprejudice. We conclude the court should have granted plaintiff's motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint. Therefore, we reverse and remand for the trial court to\n\nset a preemptory trial date.\n\n         The parties are neighbors and have a longstanding dispute regarding their\n\nproperty line. After defendants installed a fence in 2006 or 2007, plaintiff asked\n\nthem to remove it, claiming the fence was on his property. Defendants did not\n\ndo so.\n\n         In 2011, defendants sought permission from the East Hanover Land Use\n\nBoard (Board) to construct a two-story addition on their home. Their application\n\nincluded requests for certain variances. Plaintiff objected to the application,\n\nraising the property line dispute. Defendants withdrew the application.\n\n         In April 2019, defendants applied to the Board for permission to construct\n\na one-story addition on their house, with variances for setbacks and location of\n\na garage. Plaintiff again objected to the application, reiterating the continued\n\ndispute regarding the property line, and asserting a discrepancy between the\n\nparties' surveys. The Board approved defendants' application with amendments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                          2\n\f        Thereafter, the self-represented plaintiff filed a complaint against\n\ndefendants asserting causes of action for adverse possession, trespass, and to\n\nquiet title, and sought a declaratory judgment. In the complaint, he asserted he\n\nwas disabled and suffered from unspecified \"medical ailments.\" He stated his\n\nvolunteer caregiver had assisted him in the proceedings before the Board in 2011\n\nand 2019, and in filing the complaint.\n\n        In October 2019, the case was transferred to the Chancery Division. It\n\nwas referred to mediation in March 2020 but the parties were unable to reach a\n\nsettlement. A trial date was scheduled for September 9, 2020, but the trial did\n\nnot take place.1 In January 2021, the court issued a case management order\n\nsetting various deadlines and technical specifications in anticipation of a vi rtual\n\ntrial set for March 25, 2021.\n\n        Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment and filed a pretrial\n\nmemorandum.         Plaintiff retained counsel who requested a thirty-day\n\nadjournment of the trial date. The trial was adjourned to April 27, 2021.\n\n        On March 23, 2021, plaintiff sought leave to file an amended complaint\n\nseeking (1) an injunction of defendants' variances, and (2) the removal of\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The record does not reflect why the trial was not convened.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         3\n\fdefendants' fence from plaintiff's property. Defendants opposed the motion and\n\nplaintiff filed opposition to defendants' summary judgment application.\n\n        In early April, plaintiff's counsel requested an adjournment of the April\n\n20, 2021 pretrial conference because of a family vacation. He also requested\n\nthe court adjourn the trial date to May 4, 2021.\n\n        In an April 21, 2021 letter, plaintiff's counsel advised the court that\n\nplaintiff \"is not well and is in need of psychiatric treatment.\" Counsel further\n\nstated that plaintiff \"will be seen by a doctor soon and a proper letter from this\n\ndoctor will be submitted to the court upon receipt.\"\n\n        On May 14, 2021, the court: (1) granted defendants' partial summary\n\njudgment, dismissing the adverse possession claim; and (2) denied plaintiff's\n\nmotion to file an amended complaint.\n\n        On June 10, 2021, the court sua sponte entered an order of dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice for failure to prosecute. The order stated: \"Unless a [v]erified\n\n[c]omplaint for [g]uardianship of [p]laintiff is filed within [thirty] days,\n\ndismissal shall convert to a dismissal with prejudice of the above action.\"\n\n        On July 8, 2021 2, plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the court seeking\n\nreinstatement of the case on the trial calendar. Counsel explained that plaintiff\n\n\n2\n    The letter is mistakenly dated June 8, 2021.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         4\n\f\"has been under the care of a psychiatrist which was the basis for the dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice.\"      However, \"[u]nder further evaluation, [the] doctor\n\ndetermined [plaintiff] is deemed to be competent to stand trial on his own\n\nbehalf.\" Counsel promised to send \"corroboration\" of the psychiatrist's finding\n\nonce the doctor returned from vacation at the end of July and requested the court\n\n\"kindly reinstate this case on the trial calendar.\"\n\n      Defendants responded in a letter, opposing reinstatement of the litigation,\n\nand citing plaintiff's \"pattern\" of delaying the trial. Defendants urged the court\n\nto enforce its \"specific\" order and permanently dismiss the complaint.\n\n      In reply, plaintiff's counsel advised the court that plaintiff had acted in\n\ngood faith and in accordance with the recommendations of his treating doctor.\n\nCounsel stated the doctor found plaintiff could participate in a trial with the\n\nassistance of counsel and did not need \"a guardian for his day[-]to[-]day\n\nactivities at this time.\" Counsel also reminded the court that defendants had also\n\nrequested adjournments at the commencement of the litigation \"in an effort to\n\nstall same while they were completing the construction of their home.\" He\n\nrequested that \"the matter proceed to trial at the court's earliest convenience .\"\n\n      On August 6, 2021, plaintiff moved to vacate the dismissal order and to\n\nreinstate his complaint.     In support of the motion, plaintiff submitted a\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                         5\n\fcertification from counsel, attached to which was a physician's note indicating\n\nthat plaintiff had \"the capacity to understand, listen and digest information and\n\nto act in a logical and rational way on such information.\"3\n\n      By order and written statement of reasons dated January 19, 2022, the\n\ncourt denied plaintiff's motion to vacate the order of dismissal. The court found\n\nplaintiff had not complied with the terms of the June 10, 2021 order that required\n\nhim to file a guardianship complaint, and defendants had been \"significantly\n\nprejudiced\" by plaintiff's \"inexcusable delays.\"\n\n      The court explained:\n\n            Trial has been delayed or adjourned due to plaintiff's\n            inability to proceed since September 2020. The court\n            has had the opportunity to interact with plaintiff and\n            witness his demeanor, resulting in the directive to his\n            attorney that a [c]omplaint for [g]uardianship be filed\n            on his behalf. Without a [g]uardianship [c]omplaint,\n            the court cannot properly ascertain whether plaintiff\n            has the ability to act in his best interest, even if\n            represented by counsel.\n\n                  Plaintiff's continued delays have considerably\n            prejudiced defendants in this matter.        Though\n            defendant[s] ha[ve] not attached a schedule of\n            attorney's fees, [they] ha[ve] objected to multiple\n\n\n3\n  The appellate record does not include this certification or the physician's note.\nWe have derived this information from the trial court's January 19, 2022\nstatement of reasons issued with the order denying plaintiff's motion to vacate\nthe dismissal order.\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                        6\n\f            delays in this matter, citing prejudice to defendant[s]\n            based on \"increased legal fees.\" . . . .\n\n                  Plaintiff did not file any compliant motion\n            pursuant to the June 10, 2021, [o]rder, and, despite\n            notice, filed no motion until after his case was\n            dismissed with prejudice. Specifically, two days before\n            the required motion was due, plaintiff filed a letter\n            explaining why [he] would not be filing any motion.\n\n            [(citations omitted).]\n\nThe court concluded: \"This case remains dismissed with prejudice.\"\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in not vacating the June\n\n10, 2021 order because: (1) it was unsigned and therefore invalid; (2) it required\n\nplaintiff to file a guardianship complaint as a precondition to vacatur and\n\nreinstatement of the complaint; and (3) the court did not consider the expert\n\nmedical proof that plaintiff was competent to proceed to trial.\n\n      We review the order denying plaintiff's motion for vacatur and\n\nreinstatement for an abuse of discretion. Est. of Semprevivo ex rel. Semprevivo\n\nv. Lahham, 468 N.J. Super. 1, 11 (App. Div. 2021).\n\n      Plaintiff correctly notes that the June 10, 2021 order is not signed by the\n\njudge. However, plaintiff has not shown any harm resulting from this technical\n\noversight, which is insufficient to warrant reversal of the order on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-2423-21\n                                        7\n\f      However, it is the court's mandate within the June 2021 order and the\n\nprocedural deficiency in the manner in which the order was issued that\n\nconstrains us to reverse the subsequent January 2022 order denying vacatur and\n\nreinstatement.   Importantly, because defendants did not file a motion for\n\ndismissal, plaintiff was deprived an opportunity to present opposition. Instead,\n\nthe court sua sponte dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to prosecute\n\nand required plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint to avoid dismissal with\n\nprejudice. There is no authority for that process.\n\n      Rule 1:13-7 addresses the dismissal of civil cases for lack of prosecution;\n\nRule 1:13-7(a) sets forth the procedure for a dismissal:\n\n            [E]xcept as otherwise provided by rule or court order,\n            whenever an action has been pending for four months\n            or, if a general equity action, for two months, without a\n            required proceeding having been taken therein as\n            hereinafter defined in subsection (b), the court shall\n            issue written notice to the plaintiff advising that the\n            action as to any or all defendants will be dismissed\n            without prejudice 60 days following the date of the\n            notice or 30 days thereafter in general equity cases\n            unless, within said period, action specified in\n            subsection (c) is taken. If no such action is taken, the\n            court shall enter an order of dismissal without prejudice\n            as to any named defendant and shall furnish the plaintiff\n            with a copy thereof.\n\n            [(emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2423-21\n                                        8\n\f      An action can only be dismissed by the court on its own order if a party\n\nhas failed to complete a required proceeding as defined under Rule 1:13-7(b):\n\nfailure to file (1) a proof or acknowledgement of service; (2) an answer; or (3)\n\nan entry of default or default judgment. Plaintiff was not deficient regarding\n\nany of those proceedings. In addition, the court did not issue written notice to\n\nplaintiff that it intended to dismiss the case without prejudice within thirty days\n\nif plaintiff did not comply with Rule 1:13-7(c).\n\n      Moreover, the court created its own required proceeding or required\n\naction, that is, a guardianship complaint, in order for plaintiff to avoid dismissal\n\nwith prejudice. However, the Rule does not include that action as a premise for\n\na court-initiated dismissal.\n\n      Guardianship proceedings are addressed in N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24 to -29 and\n\nRule 4:86-1 to -8. To appoint a guardian, a court must find that a person is\n\nincapacitated, N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24.1, with an \"[i]ncapacitated individual\" defined\n\nas \"an individual who is impaired by reason of mental illness or intellectual\n\ndisability to the extent that the individual lacks sufficient capacity to govern\n\nhimself and manage his affairs.\" N.J.S.A. 3B:1-2.\n\n      The record does not support the need for a guardianship proceeding. The\n\nonly reference to any issue relating to plaintiff's competence was in his counsel's\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         9\n\fApril 21, 2021 letter to the court indicating that plaintiff was \"not well\" and\n\nneeded \"psychiatric treatment.\" That is not sufficient to establish that plaintiff\n\nwas an \"incapacitated individual.\" And the court's June 2021 order does not\n\ninclude any reasons for its directive to plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint\n\nor face a permanent dismissal of his action.\n\n      There may have been discussions between counsel and perhaps with the\n\ncourt about plaintiff's competency.       But there is no record of any such\n\nconversations. We are supplied only with the correspondence as outlined above\n\nand the court's brief reference in its January 2022 order that it ordered the filing\n\nof a guardianship complaint following an \"interaction\" with plaintiff and\n\nobserving his demeanor.\n\n      But even accepting plaintiff's counsel raised a flag regarding plaintiff's\n\nmental health, the record does not support an order compelling a guardianship\n\ncomplaint. To the contrary, the record reflects plaintiff was examined by a\n\npsychiatrist and within several weeks counsel informed the court and defense\n\ncounsel that the psychiatrist deemed plaintiff competent and able to participate\n\nin a trial. Furthermore, plaintiff presented the court with documentation from\n\nhis doctor supporting his competency assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                        10\n\f      Under Rule 1:13-7(a), a plaintiff may move to vacate a dismissal order\n\nand reinstate its complaint. \"The motion shall be granted on good cause shown\n\nif filed within 90 days of the order of dismissal, and thereafter shall be granted\n\nonly on a showing of exceptional circumstances.\" R. 1:13-7(a).\n\n      Plaintiff filed the motion to vacate within ninety days of the June 2021\n\norder. Moreover, plaintiff established \"good cause\" warranting reinstatement of\n\nthe complaint. The June 2021 order was noncompliant with the court rules, and\n\nplaintiff's counsel's submissions attested to plaintiff's mental competence and\n\nthe lack of any need for a guardianship proceeding, as well as his ability to go\n\nto trial \"at the court's earliest convenience.\" As we have previously stated:\n\n                   \"Good cause\" is an amorphous term, that is, it \"is\n            difficult of precise delineation. Its application requires\n            the exercise of sound discretion in light of the facts and\n            circumstances of the particular case considered in the\n            context of the purposes of the [c]ourt [r]ule being\n            applied.\" Del[.] Valley Wholesale Florist, Inc. v.\n            Addalia, 349 [N.J.

Therefore, the\n\ncourt erred in denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the June 2021 order and\n\nreinstate the complaint. Moreover, the court did not find, and defendants did\n\nnot establish, any prejudice other than a reference to legal fees.

He argues the\n\nPCR court erred by rejecting his claim that trial counsel was ineffective by\n\nfailing to argue defendant's relative age\u2014twenty-three when he committed the\n\noffenses to which he pleaded guilty\u2014and difficult upbringing should have been\n\nconsidered by the trial court in mitigation of his sentence. Unpersuaded by\n\ndefendant's arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      A grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with second-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit kidnapping, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:13-\n\n1(b)(1);   first-degree   kidnapping,   N.J.S.A.   2C:13-1(b)(1);   first-degree\n\nconspiracy to commit murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and\n\n(2); first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2); first-degree felony\n\nmurder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(3); second-degree unlawful possession of a\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                        2\n\fhandgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b); and second-degree possession of a weapon for\n\nan unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a).\n\n      Defendant later pleaded guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement\n\nwith the State. Under the agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to an amended\n\ncharge of first-degree aggravated manslaughter, first-degree kidnapping, first-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit murder, and second-degree unlawful possession of\n\na handgun. The State agreed to recommend dismissal of the remaining charges\n\nand that the court impose an aggregate sentence not to exceed twenty-years\n\nsubject to the requirements of the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:43-7.2.\n\n      At the plea proceeding, defendant testified that he and three of his co-\n\ndefendants traveled by car from Newark to Jersey City and kidnapped the victim\n\nby forcibly placing her in the trunk of their vehicle for the purpose of\n\ntransporting her to Newark where she would be \"badly hurt or killed.\" After\n\ndefendant and his cohorts transported the victim to Newark, she was taken out\n\nof the trunk and brought into an abandoned house by one of the co-defendants\n\nfor the purpose of \"shoot[ing] her dead.\" Defendant testified he knew one of the\n\nco-defendants had a gun and was going \"to shoot [the victim] dead.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                       3\n\f      Defendant admitted he stood outside the house as a \"lookout\" \"to make\n\nsure that no police or anyone else came by while\" the co-defendant was in the\n\nhouse with the victim. Defendant testified his participation in the kidnapping\n\nand murder was \"all part of an agreement [he] had made\" with the co-defendants.\n\nDefendant admitted he had the ability to exercise control over the handgun the\n\nco-defendant used to shoot the victim and that he exercised constructive\n\npossession of the handgun. Defendant also testified that as he stood outside the\n\nhouse, he heard gunshots from within it.\n\n      The court accepted defendant's plea and later sentenced defendant in\n\naccordance with the plea agreement. At sentencing, the court noted defendant\n\nwas then twenty-eight years old, of good mental health, and had admitted to\n\nprior drug use. The court noted defendant's membership in the Pirus sect of the\n\nBloods gang, his two adjudications and one deferred disposition as a juvenile,\n\nand his seventeen disorderly persons convictions as an adult.\n\n      The sentencing court found aggravating factors: three, the risk defendant\n\nwill commit another offense, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3); five, there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood defendant is involved in organized criminal activity, N.J.S.A. 2C:44 -\n\n1(a)(5); six, the extent of defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness\n\nof the offenses for which he had been convicted, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(6); and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                       4\n\fnine, the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:44-1(a)(9). The court did not list any mitigating factors on the judgment of\n\nconviction.\n\n      The court imposed an aggregate sentence of twenty years subject to the\n\nrequirements of NERA.1 We affirmed defendant's aggregate sentence on his\n\ndirect appeal, State v. Adams, No. A-3302-17 (App. Div. Dec. 3, 2018), but\n\nremanded for entry of an amended judgment of conviction merging defendant's\n\nconviction for conspiracy to commit murder with his conviction on the amended\n\ncharge of aggravated manslaughter.\n\n      The court later entered an amended judgment of conviction reflecting the\n\nmerger, but it did not alter or modify defendant's aggregate twenty-year\n\nsentence. The Supreme Court denied defendant's petition for certification from\n\nour affirmance of his sentence. State v. Adams, 238 N.J. 43 (2019).\n\n      Defendant filed a timely pro se PCR petition, claiming the trial court erred\n\nby failing to consider \"mitigating factors during sentencing\" and trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective by failing to \"argue these mitigating factors.\"        In a brief\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The court imposed concurrent twenty-year sentences on the first-degree\nkidnapping, conspiracy to commit murder, and aggravated manslaughter\noffenses.\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        5\n\fsubmitted by his PCR counsel, defendant made the following arguments in\n\nsupport of his petition:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE TRIAL COURT\n            WAS IMPROPER, ILLEGAL, OR OTHERWISE\n            UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n\n            POINT II\n\n            DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE   OF   TRIAL   COUNSEL    IN\n            VIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES AND NEW\n            JERSEY CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n            POINT III\n\n            THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ERRORS\n            COMPLAINED OF RENDERED THE TRIAL\n            UNFAIR.\n\n            POINT IV\n\n            DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF APPELLATE COUNSEL.\n\n            POINT V\n\n            AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS REQUIRED WITH\n            REGARD    TO   THE    ALLEGATIONS    OF\n            DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR [PCR].\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  A-0227-22\n                                  6\n\f            POINT VI\n\n            [] DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR [PCR] SHOULD\n            NOT    BE  BARRED    BY    PROCEDURAL\n            CONSIDERATION[].\n\n      Following argument on the petition, the court issued an opinion from the\n\nbench.   The court explained that the kidnapping was captured on a video\n\nrecording. The sentencing court described the video in detail, explaining it\n\nshowed the victim was \"taken from in front of her friend's house in Jersey City,\n\nmanhandled across the sidewalk at gunpoint, stuck in the trunk of a car at\n\ngunpoint, [and] hit over the head as she entered it.\" The sentencing court further\n\nnoted the video showed defendant \"fetch[] the gun\" that a co-defendant placed\n\nto the victim's head during the kidnapping, and that after the victim was placed\n\nin the trunk of the car and driven to Newark, she was \"executed\"\u2014\"shot five\n\ntimes\"\u2014\"as discipline for her violation of gang rules.\" The sentencing court\n\nfurther detailed defendant's testimony during the plea proceeding describing his\n\nparticipation in the kidnapping and execution.\n\n      The PCR court, which also presided over defendant's sentencing,\n\nexplained that it had considered mitigating factor twelve, the willingness of\n\ndefendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-\n\n1(b)(12) at sentencing, but did not list it on defendant's judgment of conviction\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        7\n\fbased on a concern it would have \"adverse collateral consequences\" for him\n\nwhile incarcerated.2 The court further noted it had considered the non-statutory\n\nmitigating factor of defendant's age at the time it imposed sentence, but\n\nacknowledged the \"factor was not mentioned\" and it \"did not make a specific\n\nruling\" as to the factor.\n\n      The court further explained that had defendant's trial counsel argued the\n\nnon-statutory factor of defendant's relative youth at sentencing, it would have\n\nrejected the contention due to defendant's juvenile record, the numerous\n\ndisorderly persons convictions defendant had as an adult, and defendant's \"gang\n\naffiliation . . . which was intimately affiliated with the motive for the crime[s]\"\n\nfor which he was sentenced. The court further noted it was aware of \"the\n\ncognitive science about the . . . development of the [human] brain,\" but that\n\ndefendant's crimes were \"not . . . act[s] of an impetuous . . . youthful folly\" and\n\ninstead constituted \"an orchestrated kidnapping and execution.\"\n\n      The PCR court also noted appellate counsel on defendant's direct appeal\n\nargued the sentencing court \"didn't properly account for\" defendant's youth. The\n\nPCR court further explained we had rejected defendant's argument, affirmed his\n\n\n\n2\n The PCR court explained that it would amend the JOC to reflect its finding of\nmitigating factor twelve in its prior determination of defendant's sentence.\n                                                                             A-0227-22\n                                        8\n\fsentence, and concluded \"the sentence was not manifestly excessive or unduly\n\npunitive and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\"\n\n      The PCR court concluded defendant's argument trial counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to argue at sentencing that the court should find the non-\n\nstatutory mitigating factor of defendant's relative youth was barred under Rule\n\n3:22-5. The Rule provides that \"[a] prior adjudication upon the merits of any\n\nground for relief\" in a PCR petition \"is conclusive whether made in the\n\nproceedings resulting in the conviction or in any post-conviction proceeding\n\nbrought pursuant to [Rule 3:22] or prior to the adoption thereof, or in any appeal\n\ntaken from such proceedings.\"        R. 3:22-5.    The PCR court determined\n\ndefendant's claim the court erred by failing to consider his relative youth at\n\nsentencing had been addressed and rejected by this court on defendant's direct\n\nappeal and, therefore, the claim could not properly support a PCR petition under\n\nRule 3:22-5.\n\n      The PCR court also considered the merits of defendant's argument that his\n\nsentence was illegal because the trial court had purportedly failed to properly\n\nfind and weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. The court rejected the\n\ncontention, finding a court's failure to correctly find and weigh the statutory\n\nfactors in its imposition of sentence does not result in an illegal sentence. See\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        9\n\fState v. Acevedo, 205 N.J. 40, 47 (2011) (explaining an \"allegation[] of\n\nimproper consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors\" does not support\n\na cognizable illegal-sentence claim in a PCR petition).\n\n      The PCR court also addressed defendant's claim trial counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to argue at sentencing the court should find the non -\n\nstatutory mitigating factor of defendant's relative youth. The court analyzed the\n\nclaim under the two-pronged standard established in Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984), and adopted as applicable under the New Jersey\n\nConstitution by our Supreme Court in State v. Fritz, 105 N.J. 42, 58 (1987), for\n\nassessing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court determined\n\ndefendant failed to sustain his burden under the standard and rejected the claim.\n\n      The court entered an order denying defendant's PCR petition without an\n\nevidentiary hearing. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, defendant presents the following arguments:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY\n            HEARING AS HE ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE\n            CASE THAT SENTENCING COUNSEL'S FAILURE\n            TO ADDRESS DEFENDANT'S RELATIVE YOUTH\n            AT THE TIME HE COMMITTED THE INSTANT\n            OFFENSES AS A NON-STATUTORY MITIGATING\n            FACTOR      CONSTITUTES      INEFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF SENTENCING COUNSEL.\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      10\n\f            POINT II\n\n            DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR [PCR] SHOULD\n            NOT   BE   BARRED    BY   PROCEDURAL\n            CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n                                       II.\n\n      We review the legal conclusions of a PCR court de novo. State v. Harris,\n\n181 N.J. 391, 419 (2004). The de novo standard of review also applies to mixed\n\nquestions of fact and law. Id. at 420. Where an evidentiary hearing has not been\n\nheld, it is within our authority \"to conduct a de novo review of both the factual\n\nfindings and legal conclusions of the PCR court.\" Id. at 421 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). We apply these standards here.\n\n      The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\nParagraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution guarantee that a defendant in a\n\ncriminal proceeding has the right to the assistance of counsel in his or her\n\ndefense. The right to counsel includes \"the right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\" State v. Nash, 212 N.J. 518, 541 (2013) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 686).\n\n      In Strickland, the Court established a two-part test as the standard to\n\ndetermine whether a defendant has been deprived of the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; see also Fritz, 105 N.J. at 58. Under the\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      11\n\ffirst prong of the Strickland standard, a petitioner must show counsel's\n\nperformance was deficient.     Ibid. A petitioner must demonstrate counsel's\n\nhandling of the matter \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and\n\n\"counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel'\n\nguaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" Id. at 687-88. Under the\n\nstandard's second prong, a defendant must \"affirmatively prove\" \"a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\" State v. Gideon, 244 N.J. 538, 551\n\n(2021) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\n\n      \"With respect to both prongs of the Strickland test, a defendant asserting\n\nineffective assistance of counsel on PCR bears the burden of proving his or her\n\nright to relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\" State v. Gaitan, 209 N.J.\n\n339, 350 (2012) (citing State v. Echols, 199 N.J. 344, 357 (2009); State v.\n\nGoodwin, 173 N.J. 583, 593 (2002)). A failure to satisfy either prong of the\n\nStrickland standard requires the denial of a PCR petition. Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 700; Nash, 212 N.J. at 542; Fritz, 105 N.J. at 52.\n\n      Defendant committed the crimes for which he was convicted when he was\n\ntwenty-three years old, and he was sentenced in 2014 when he was twenty-six.\n\nAt the time of sentencing, the Legislature had not yet enacted mitigating factor\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                       12\n\ffourteen, which requires that a sentencing court consider that a defendant was\n\nunder the age of twenty-six at the time of the commission of the offenses for\n\nwhich sentence shall be imposed. N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(14).3 Thus, there was\n\nno statutory mitigating factor based on defendant's relative youth that could have\n\nbeen properly argued by trial counsel at defendant's 2014 sentencing.\n\n      Prior to defendant's 2014 sentencing, the Supreme Court had explained\n\nthat a \"defendant's relative youth ordinarily would inure to his [or her] benefit\"\n\nin the determination of an appropriate sentence. State v. Dunbar, 108 N.J. 80,\n\n95 (1987); see also State v. Pindale, 249 N.J. Super. 266, 289 (App. Div. 1991)\n\n(explaining youth was \"not one of the delineated statutory mitigating\n\ncircumstances,\" but noting the sentencing court's failure to give \"consideration\n\nto [the] defendant's youth\"); State v. Tanksley, 245 N.J. Super. 390, 397 (App.\n\nDiv. 1991) (quoting Dunbar, 108 N.J. at 95) (remanding for resentencing a\n\nseventeen-year-old defendant on an aggravated manslaughter conviction and\n\nnoting the defendant's relative youth should \"inure to his benefit\" at\n\nresentencing). As such, when the court imposed defendant's sentence, there was\n\n\n3\n    In 2020, the legislature amended N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b) to add statutory\nmitigating factor fourteen\u2014\"[t]he defendant was under [twenty-six] years of age\nat the time of the commission of the offense.\" L. 2020, c. 110, \u00a7 1 (eff. Oct. 19,\n2020). In State v. Lane, 251 N.J. 84, 87 (2022), the Court held mitigating factor\nfourteen applies only to sentences imposed on or after the date of its enactment.\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                       13\n\fwell-established precedent supporting an argument that his relative youth should\n\n\"inure to his benefit\" in the sentencing calculus. Dunbar, 108 N.J. at 95; see\n\nalso State v. Rivera, 249 N.J. 285, 301 (2021) (summarizing precedent\n\nestablishing \"the importance of considering youth in making sentencing\n\ndecisions\").\n\n         Defendant correctly notes trial counsel did not argue at sentencing that\n\ndefendant's relative youth should be considered by the court in mitigation of his\n\nsentence. He claims trial counsel was ineffective by failing to urge the court to\n\nconsider his relative youth at sentencing and the PCR court erred by finding he\n\nhad not satisfied his burden under the Strickland standard based on counsel's\n\nerror.\n\n         \"Although a demonstration of prejudice constitutes the second part of the\n\nStrickland analysis, courts are permitted leeway to choose to examine first\n\nwhether a defendant has been prejudiced, and if not, to dismiss the claim without\n\ndetermining whether counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient .\"\n\nGaitan, 209 N.J. at 350 (citation omitted). Here, based on our review of the\n\nrecord, we are convinced the court correctly denied defendant's PCR petition\n\nbecause he did not satisfy the \"second, and far more difficult prong of the\"\n\nStrickland standard, Gideon, 244 N.J. at 550; that is, defendant failed to\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        14\n\faffirmatively demonstrate there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's\n\nalleged error, the result of his sentencing proceeding would have been different,\n\nid. at 550-51; see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n      As the PCR court\u2014which, as noted was also the sentencing court\u2014\n\nexplained, even if trial counsel had argued defendant's relative youth in\n\nmitigation of sentence, that non-statutory mitigating factor would not have\n\nchanged the sentence imposed.       The court explained that defendant's prior\n\njuvenile and adult criminal history, his participation in organized criminal\n\nactivity, the premediated kidnapping and execution of the victim, the need to\n\ndeter defendant and others from violating the law, and the risk defendant would\n\ncommit another offense so outweighed any reasonable reliance on defendant's\n\nrelative youth as a non-statutory mitigating factor that there is no probability\n\ndefendant's sentence would have been different if his counsel had argued his\n\nrelative youth should also be considered as a factor in sentencing.         More\n\nimportantly, however, defendant made and makes no affirmative showing that\n\nhad his counsel argued his relative youth in mitigation of his sentence, there is\n\na reasonable probability the outcome of his sentencing proceeding would have\n\nbeen different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Gideon, 244 N.J. at 550-51.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                       15\n\f      Additionally, the court was aware of defendant's age at the time he\n\ncommitted the very serious offenses for which he was convicted. The court\n\nnoted defendant's age\u2014twenty-six\u2014at the time of sentencing, knew that the\n\ncrimes were committed three years earlier, and therefore was fully aware of\n\ndefendant's age\u2014twenty-three\u2014when he committed the offenses.            And, on\n\ndefendant's direct appeal, we rejected defendant's claim the sentencing court\n\nerred by failing to consider his relative youth as a non-statutory mitigating\n\nfactor, concluding his sentence was not unfair, excessive, or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Stated differently, we determined that based on the other\n\ncircumstances presented by defendant at sentencing, the court's failure to\n\nconsider defendant's relative youth was of no moment.\n\n      Thus, on the record presented, defendant failed to sustain his burden of\n\ndemonstrating prejudice under Strickland's second prong and, for that reason\n\nalone, his PCR claim his counsel was ineffective at sentencing fails. Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 700; Gaitan, 209 N.J. at 350.\n\n      Because we are convinced defendant failed to sustain his burden under\n\nStrickland's second prong, it is unnecessary to address his claim trial counsel's\n\nperformance was deficient under Strickland's first prong by failing to argue\n\ndefendant's relative youth should be considered as a non-statutory mitigating\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      16\n\ffactor at sentencing. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700 (explaining a failure to\n\nsatisfy either prong of the standard requires the denial of a PCR petition); Nash,\n\n212 N.J. at 543 (explaining a defendant must satisfy both prongs of the\n\nStrickland standard to obtain PCR on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).\n\nWe note only that in State v. Hess, the Court held that a failure to \"present\n\nmitigating evidence or argue for mitigating factors\" at sentencing constitutes\n\ndeficient performance under Strickland's first prong where \"the sentencing court\n\nwas deprived of information and arguments that might well have led it to impose\n\na lesser term,\" 207 N.J. 123, 154 (2011). For the reasons we have explained,\n\ndefendant has not made that showing here.\n\n      In sum, defendant failed to sustain his burden of establishing a prima facie\n\ncase of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Strickland standard.4 We\n\ntherefore affirm the court's order denying his PCR petition and find it\n\n\n\n4\n   Defendant challenges only the PCR court's determinations that he failed to\nsustain his burden of establishing a prima facie claim his trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance at sentencing and that the claim is also barred under Rule\n3:22-5. Defendant does not argue on appeal the PCR court erred by rejecting\nany of the other arguments he presented in support of his petition. We therefore\ndeem those arguments abandoned.

After a trial, defendant was convicted on robbery, aggravated assault,\n\nand drug possession charges and was sentenced to an aggregate term of thirty-\n\nfour years subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2.\n\nWe affirmed on direct appeal, and defendant filed his petition, which the trial\n\ncourt denied without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant contends the PCR court\n\nerred by rejecting his claims that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nHe contends, among other things, trial counsel failed to:        investigate alibi\n\nwitnesses; file certain motions; and obtain a plea offer from the State. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      We glean the facts and relevant procedural history in part from our opinion\n\naffirming defendant's conviction and sentence, State v. Dukes, No. A-4668-17\n\n(App. Div. Mar. 26, 2021) (slip op. at 4).\n\n                  During the early morning hours of April 10,\n            2017, [the three victims] Rodriguez, Ramos-Sanchez,\n            and Paz left a nightclub and headed towards a\n            restaurant. A nearby surveillance camera captured\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                        2\n\fthem on film as they passed by shortly before the\nrobbery. At trial, Rodriguez identified the man, seen\nwearing a hat, walking behind the group almost\nimmediately after they went out of camera range, as the\nperson who punched him in the head from behind,\nknocking him to the ground. Paz screamed for help,\nsomehow fell, broke her ankle, and rolled beneath a\nparked car. Rodriguez attempted to get up to help her,\nbut [he] was struck again by the man with a hat, this\ntime with an object. That blow left a laceration on\nRodriguez's forehead requiring twelve stitches that left\na visible scar shown to the jury. The man with the hat\ndemanded Rodriguez's money and searched his\npockets.\n\n      ....\n\n      Paz's recollection was that as the group was\nwalking, someone demanded their money. She thought\nthe assailants were in front of the group but could not\nbe certain.\n\n      Ramos-Sanchez said she saw two men approach\nfrom the rear and heard them demand money; she was\nsprayed in the face with an irritant. She immediately\nran to an intersecting street, and the men chasing her\nturned away. Ramos-Sanchez encountered pedestrians\nleaving a bar, who called the police on her behalf. Her\neye remained cloudy after the incident, although she\nrefused medical attention at the time.\n\n      None of the victims, who had been drinking,\ncould identify their attackers. Rodriguez remembered\nonly that the man who struck him in the forehead wore\ndark clothes and a cap. He initially thought he was hit\nwith a gun, but over time became uncertain as to the\nnature of the object. Rodriguez and Ramos-Sanchez\n\n\n                                                           A-2227-22\n                           3\n\f           were sure there were only two assailants; Paz thought\n           there may have been three or four.\n\n                 New Brunswick Police Sergeant Theirry\n           Lemmerling obtained the surveillance videos, shown to\n           the jury, from two neighborhood stores.                He\n           downloaded them onto a flash drive, then transferring\n           them to a disc. During trial, all three victims identified\n           themselves on the video. The person walking closest to\n           the group as it leaves camera range was wearing a hat.\n           Lemmerling made still photographs from the video\n           footage of the two men walking behind the victims,\n           including the man with a hat. A few days later, two\n           New Brunswick police officers drove by defendant\n           standing at a corner. They had been shown the still\n           photograph that morning and knew there was an\n           outstanding warrant for his arrest related to the robbery.\n           The officers stopped, and when one of them told\n           defendant he had an arrest warrant, defendant fled. A\n           third officer saw defendant running, saw him discard\n           ten glassine envelopes containing heroin and fiorinal\n           fentanyl, and caught him. When arrested, defendant\n           was carrying a can of pepper spray.\n\n                 At the station, New Brunswick Police\n           Department Detective Brandt Gregus questioned\n           defendant and showed him the still photo. Defendant\n           admitted he was the man wearing a hat walking a few\n           paces behind the three victims[,] moments before the\n           robbery. That picture was admitted into evidence and\n           shown to the jury when Gregus testified.\n\n     Defendant was indicted by a grand jury, and charged, along with a co-\n\ndefendant, Ricky Greene, with: three counts of first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:15-1; second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(a) and\n\n\n                                                                        A-2227-22\n                                       4\n\f2C:15-1; and two counts of second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-\n\n1b(1). Defendant alone was also charged with third-degree possession of heroin,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:35-10a(1), and fourth-degree resisting arrest, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2a(2).\n\n      The State made a joint plea offer to defendants. The proposed agreement\n\nwas conditioned upon each defendant pleading guilty. One defendant would\n\nplead guilty to second-degree aggravated assault, with a recommended eight-\n\nyear sentence subject to NERA, while the other defendant would plead to\n\nsecond-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, for which the State would\n\nrecommend a sentence in the third-degree range. Co-defendant Greene rejected\n\nthe dual plea offer and elected to proceed to trial.\n\n      Defendant continued his plea negotiations, and eventually at a pretrial\n\nconference he advised the court through trial counsel that he did not want to go\n\nto trial and was willing to plead to second-degree aggravated assault in exchange\n\nfor a five-year sentence. However, the State indicated that it would agree to\n\nthose terms only if defendant agreed to inculpate Greene. Plea negotiations with\n\ndefendant ceased, as the State conditioned defendant's plea on getting a plea\n\nfrom Greene. The following colloquy between the trial court and defendant took\n\nplace at a pretrial conference:\n\n            THE COURT: Mr. Dukes, you know what the deal is\n            here. I can't force the prosecutor to give you a deal that\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                         5\n\fhe doesn't want to give you. You want \u2013 he wants to\ngive you five years. . . . Mr. Dukes you were present in\ncourt when I spoke to Mr. Greene, you understand\nwhat's at risk here, right? You have priors?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: All right. So you understand what's at\nrisk here. If you're convicted, conceivably you can go\nto prison for the rest of your life, right? The\nprosecutor's offering you five years, but he wants you\nto inculpate Mr. Greene who's seated right next to you.\nBecause the prosecutor thinks that he was involved to\nthe same extent that you were involved in this robbery.\nI understand your position is . . . I want the deal, I want\nto tell the truth, but the truth is, Mr. Greene wasn't\ninvolved to the same extent that I was involved in,\nright?\n\nDEFENDANT: Exactly.\n\nTHE COURT: Right. But I can't give you that deal\nbecause the deals don't come from me, the deal comes\nfrom the prosecutor. You understand that? So right\nnow \u2013 and you know what the proofs are in this case,\nbecause the prosecutor just laid it out on the record\nwhen we spoke about Mr. Greene. So all we can do\nhere is schedule this matter for trial. You have two\nchoices. We can go to trial, you know what the risks\nare. Or you can take the deal, but the deal that the\nprosecutor is demanding is that you give up Mr. \u2013 you\ngive up Mr. Greene, you understand that? All right. So\nwhat we're [going to] do is, we're scheduling this for\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              A-2227-22\n                            6\n\f      After defendant's trial, a jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree\n\nrobbery, second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of second-\n\ndegree aggravated assault, third-degree heroin possession, and resisting arrest.\n\nThe court sentenced defendant to an aggregate thirty-four-year term of\n\nincarceration.   We affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence on direct\n\nappeal. Dukes, slip op. at 6-10.\n\n      Defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief, alleging: his ability to\n\naccept a lesser plea was hindered by personal conflict between his trial counsel\n\nand the assistant prosecutor representing the State; his attorney failed to\n\ninvestigate potential alibi witnesses; and other errors by his trial attorney\n\namounted to cumulative error contrary to his right to effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Defendant also argued that \"inconsistent and questionable\" witness\n\ntestimony compromised his right to a fair trial.\n\n      The PCR court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing, making\n\noral findings. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim, finding the record did not support the theory that a personal dispute\n\nbetween counsel and the prosecutor caused negotiations to fail. The court also\n\nfound defendant presented no facts to support a potential alibi, and that if he\n\nhad, any testimony regarding an alibi would have been undermined by\n\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                        7\n\fdefendant's admission he was at the scene. The court also found that other errors\n\nalleged by defendant, such as failing to file certain pre-trial motions, did not\n\nconstitute a prima facie cause of ineffective assistance of counsel, and concluded\n\nthere was no cumulative error. Finally, the court determined that certain of\n\ndefendant's arguments were inapposite for PCR because they should have been\n\nraised on direct appeal.\n\n      Defendant raises the following points in his appeal:\n\n            POINT I:\n\n            THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT\n            DEFENDANT WAS NOT DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE     OF    TRIAL    COUNSEL.\n            ALTERNATIVELY, DEFENDANT ESTABLISHED\n            A PRIMA FACIE CLAIM OF INEFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL WHICH WAS\n            SUPPORTED BY MATERIAL ISSUES OF\n            DISPUTED FACTS LYING OUTSIDE THE\n            RECORD. THE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTED\n            FACTS NECESSITATED AN EVIDENTIARY\n            HEARING. THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FAILING\n            TO CONDUCT SUCH A HEARING.\n\n            POINT II:\n\n            FOR THE REASONS EXPRESSED IN POINT I,\n            SUPRA, THE PCR COURT ERRED WHEN IT\n            RULED THAT DEFENDANT FAILED TO\n            ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF\n            INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL.\n            THIS ERROR LED IT TO ERRONEOUSLY REJECT\n            DEFENDANT'S CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR.\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                        8\n\f            POINT III:\n\n            DEFENDANT      WAS     CONVICTED     BY\n            INCONSISTENT     AND      QUESTIONABLE\n            WITNESSES' TESTIMONIES. BASIC FAIR PLAY\n            AND FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS REQUIRED\n            THAT HE BE GRANTED A NEW TRIAL BY THE\n            PCR COURT.\n\n                                 II.\n\n      We use a de novo standard of review when a PCR court denies relief\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing. State v. Aburoumi, 464 N.J. Super. 326, 338\n\n(App. Div. 2020); see also State v. Nash, 212 N.J. 518, 540-41 (2013). Our rules\n\nrequire a court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition, \"only upon\n\nthe establishment of a prima facie case in support of post-conviction relief.\" R.\n\n3:22-10(b). \"A prima facie case is established when a defendant demonstrates\n\n'a reasonable likelihood that his or her claim, viewing the facts alleged in the\n\nlight most favorable to the defendant, will ultimately succeed on the merits.'\"\n\nState v. Porter, 216 N.J. 343, 355 (2013) (quoting R. 3:22-10(b)).\n\n      To establish a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\ndefendant must show: (1) counsel's performance was deficient; and (2) the\n\ndeficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; State v. Fritz,\n\n105 N.J. 42, 52 (1987) (adopting Strickland). A successful showing requires\n\ndefendant to establish \"by a preponderance of the credible evidence\" entitlement\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                       9\n\fto the requested relief. Nash, 212 N.J. at 541 (quoting State v. Preciose, 129\n\nN.J. 451, 459 (1992)).\n\n      To satisfy the first Strickland prong, \"a defendant must overcome a 'strong\n\npresumption' that counsel exercised 'reasonable professional judgment' and\n\n'sound trial strategy' in fulfilling [their] responsibilities.\" State v. Hess, 207 N.J.\n\n123, 147 (2011) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689-90). \"[I]f counsel makes\n\na thorough investigation of the law and facts and considers all likely options,\n\ncounsel's trial strategy is 'virtually unchallengeable.'\" State v. Chew, 179 N.J.\n\n186, 217 (2004) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91).\n\n      Because prejudice under Strickland's second prong is not presumed, Fritz,\n\n105 N.J. at 52, a defendant must demonstrate \"how specific errors of counsel\n\nundermined the reliability\" of the proceeding. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S.\n\n648, 659 n.26 (1984). To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is\n\na probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d             State v.\n\nGideon, 244 N.J. 538, 550-51 (2021) (alteration in original) (quoting Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 694).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                A-2227-22\n                                         10\n\f                                       III.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      Defendant argues he did not receive effective assistance of counsel during\n\nplea negotiations. Specifically, he contends that he wanted to accept a plea\n\noffer, but the offer was rescinded because of interpersonal conflict between trial\n\ncounsel and the assistant prosecutor. He alleges trial counsel informed him of\n\nthis ongoing conflict. Plaintiff posits this issue at least represents a factual\n\nquestion which justifies an evidentiary hearing. We disagree.\n\n      \"A defendant asserting plea counsel's assistance was ineffective may meet\n\nthe first prong of the Strickland standard if the defendant can show counsel's\n\nrepresentation fell short of the prevailing standards expected of criminal defense\n\nattorneys.\" State v. Vanness, 474 N.J. Super. 609, 624 (App. Div. 2023) (citing\n\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 366-67 (2010)). \"Plea counsel's performance\n\nwill not be deemed deficient if counsel has provided the defendant 'correct\n\ninformation concerning all of the relevant material consequences that flow from\n\nsuch a plea.'\" Id. at 624 (quoting State v. Agathis, 424 N.J. Super. 16, 22 (App.\n\nDiv. 2012)); see also Nu\u00f1ez-Valdez, 200 N.J. 129, 138-39 (2009).\n\n      Defendant fails to establish a prima facie claim for ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel during his plea negotiations. His claim that his plea was rescinded\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       11\n\fdue to personal issues between the lawyers is not borne out in the record. Even\n\naccepting defendant's claims about conflict as true, the record shows defendant's\n\npredicament was entirely attributable to either Greene's refusal to plead or his\n\nrefusal to testify against Greene.\n\n      The colloquy at his plea hearing shows defendant clearly understood the\n\nrequirements of the proposed plea agreement and the potential ramifications of\n\ngoing to trial. His decision to proceed to trial was knowing and voluntary. The\n\nrecord further shows trial counsel worked diligently to obtain a non-contingent\n\nplea offer from the State, even requesting a meeting with the assistant\n\nprosecutor's supervisor. Defendant failed to present proof that trial counsel\n\nprovided him with inaccurate or incomplete information during plea\n\nnegotiations.   On this question, defendant has failed to show ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n                                       B.\n\n      Defendant argues his trial counsel failed to fully investigate his case. He\n\nalleges that he asked his attorney to speak with two alibi witnesses, but counsel\n\nnever did. He contends this was ineffective assistance of counsel. We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                      12\n\f      \"Failure to investigate an alibi defense is a serious deficiency that can\n\nresult in the reversal of a conviction.\" Porter, 216 N.J. at 353. \"Indeed, 'few\n\ndefenses have greater potential for creating reasonable doubt as to a defendant's\n\nguilt in the minds of the jury [than an alibi].'\" Ibid. (quoting State v. Mitchell,\n\n149 N.J. Super. 259, 262 (App. Div. 1977)). A PCR petitioner asserting that his\n\ntrial attorney inadequately investigated a potential witness \"must assert the facts\n\nthat an investigation would have revealed, supported by affidavits or\n\ncertifications based upon the personal knowledge of the affiant or the person\n\nmaking the certification.\" Ibid. (quoting State v. Cummings, 321 N.J. Super.\n\n154, 170 (App. Div. 1999)).\n\n      Defendant's claim has no merit, as he fails to assert any specific facts\n\nwhich an investigation of his alibi witnesses would have revealed. Even if\n\ncounsel erred in failing to contact these witnesses, any potential testimony they\n\nmight have offered regarding an alibi would be critically undermined by\n\ndefendant's own admission placing himself at the scene, so he cannot show\n\nprejudice under the second prong of Strickland.\n\n      In a related argument, defendant suggests the PCR court erred by rejecting\n\nhis claim that his admission placing himself at the scene of the crime was not\n\nprobative of his guilt. Defendant's attempt to persuade the PCR court, and now\n\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                       13\n\fus, that this fact is not dispositive on a Strickland prong two analysis has no\n\nmerit. His argument that being present at the scene of the crime does not\n\nconclusively establish guilt misses the point. While true, it is not relevant in a\n\nStrickland analysis, as an alibi witness could not credibly support a theory that\n\ndefendant was present at the scene, but was somehow not the assailant.\n\nDefendant failed to present proof of ineffective assistance of counsel on this\n\nquestion and, if he had, he could not have overcome his own admission in order\n\nto show prejudice.\n\n                                        C.\n\n        Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file\n\nmotions for suppression, dismissal of the indictment, and for a Wade1 hearing.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n        A motion to suppress evidence seized at the scene of the arrest would have\n\nfailed as the heroin, which he was observed discarding while fleeing the police,\n\nwas lawfully seized as abandoned property. See State v. Johnson, 193 N.J. 528,\n\n548-549 (2008).      Similarly, a Wade hearing to challenge his out-of-court\n\nidentification by witnesses would have been futile, as witnesses were never able\n\n\n\n\n1\n    United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967).\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                        14\n\fto identify defendant. Defendant placed himself at the scene. See Pressler &\n\nVerniero, Current N.J. Court Rules, cmt. 2 on R. 3:11 (2024).\n\n      Finally, a motion to dismiss the indictment would not have succeeded as\n\ndefendant has not alleged any defect in the indictment. See State v. Bell, 241\n\nN.J. 552, 560 (2020) (\"[A] court should dismiss [an] indictment 'only on the\n\nclearest and plainest ground, and only when the indictment is manifestly\n\ndeficient or palpably defective.'\" (quoting State v. Twiggs, 233 N.J. 513, 531-\n\n32 (2018))).\n\n      Again, defendant has not established a prima facie case for ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel under Strickland.\n\n                                       D.\n\n      Defendant argues a new trial is warranted based on the doctrine of\n\nfundamental fairness pursuant to Rule 3:20-1, because he was convicted based\n\non inconsistent evidence.    Defendant specifically submits that none of the\n\nvictims were able to identify him as an assailant. A petition for PCR is not the\n\nproper vehicle for these arguments.\n\n      Grounds for a motion for post-conviction relief are limited and include:\n\n(1) deprivations of defendant's constitutional rights; (2) lack of jurisdiction by\n\nthe trial court; (3) illegal sentences; (4) collateral attack by habeus corpus or\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       15\n\fother common-law or statutory remedy; and (5) ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. R. 3:22-2. Issues that could have been raised in prior proceedings are\n\ngenerally barred from being brought in a PCR. R. 3:22-4(a).\n\n      Defendant's fundamental fairness claims are not cognizable on this record.\n\nTo the extent defendant argues for a new trial in the interest of justice pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:20-2, defendant's argument claim is time barred, as he did not raise it\n\nwithin 10 days of the jury's verdict or offer newly-discovered evidence. To the\n\nextent defendant argues sufficiency of the evidence, it was argued in his direct\n\nappeal, and cannot be raised again in a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:22. The PCR court properly rejected these claims.\n\n      To the extent we have not addressed defendant's remaining arguments, we\n\nconclude they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(2).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       16\n\f","                                NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                               APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not \"constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .\" Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited.

In proceedings where the Nebraska Evidence Rules\n                    apply, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by these rules; judicial\n                    discretion is involved only when the rules make discretion a factor in\n                    determining admissibility.\n                 3. Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists when\n                    the reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly\n                    depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in mat-\n                    ters submitted for disposition.\n                 4. Rules of Evidence: Hearsay: Appeal and Error. Apart from rul-\n                    ings under the residual hearsay exception, an appellate court reviews\n                    for clear error the factual findings underpinning a trial court\u2019s hear-\n                    say ruling and reviews de novo the court\u2019s ultimate determination to\n                    admit evidence over a hearsay objection or exclude evidence on hear-\n                    say grounds.\n                 5. Jurisdiction. One who invokes the power of the court on an issue other\n                    than the court\u2019s jurisdiction over one\u2019s person makes a general appear-\n                    ance so as to confer on the court personal jurisdiction over that person.\n                 6.

It provided notice to Christian that\nif he wished to appear and show cause why the order should\nnot remain in effect, he needed to complete the provided\n\u201cRequest for Hearing\u201d form and return it to the clerk of the\ndistrict court within 10 business days. An information sheet\nincluded with the ex parte order stated that the court would\nschedule a hearing within 30 days after reviewing the request\nfor a hearing.\n   Three days later, the court received Christian\u2019s request for\nhearing form. Later that day, the court entered an order which\nset a hearing on Monday, January 30, 2023, at 10:30 a.m.\nThe certificate of service showed that the order was sent to\nChristian via U.S. mail on January 24.\n   On January 30, 2023, Christian did not appear for the hear-\ning. The same day, the court entered an order affirming the\nprotection order.\n              Motion to Vacate Proceedings\n   Ten days later, Christian filed a motion to vacate the\nJanuary 30, 2023, order.

He attached an affidavit\nto this motion. The affidavit included an exhibit purporting to\nbe an email from the U.S. Postal Service.\n   During a hearing on the motion to vacate, Christian asserted\nthat the court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter a final\nprotection order against a nonresident respondent. The court\ninquired whether Christian submitted himself to the court\u2019s\njurisdiction when he requested a hearing. Christian argued\nthat no one could know whether he requested a hearing\nfor the purpose of challenging personal jurisdiction. Paw\u2019s\ncounsel \u201cremind[ed]\u201d the court that \u201cin the parties\u2019 pater-\nnity\/custody case, [Christian was] ordered to come here to\nNebraska to pick up his child to bring him back to Iowa every\nother weekend.\u201d\n   During the hearing, Christian offered his own affidavit with\na copy of an email attached to it. The copy of the email dif-\nfered somewhat from the one attached to his earlier affida-\nvit. Christian\u2019s affidavit stated that he did not receive the\ncourt\u2019s order for hearing until the afternoon of January 30,\n2023. He averred that the attached email had been transmit-\nted from \u201c\u2018USPS Informed Delivery\u2019\u201d to his email address at\n7:24 a.m. on January 30. The email included an image of the\nfront of an envelope from the clerk of the district court. Paw\nobjected based on foundation and hearsay. Christian argued\nthat the rules of evidence do not apply during a hearing on a\nmotion to vacate. Nonetheless, the court sustained Paw\u2019s hear-\nsay objection.\n   The court subsequently entered an order overruling the\nmotion to vacate. With respect to personal jurisdiction, the\ncourt reasoned that \u201c[t]he incidents of abuse occurred in\nNebraska and were part of regular contact from [Christian]\nto [Paw] in Nebraska.\u201d Although the bill of exceptions of\nthe hearing on the motion to vacate did not show a ruling on\nPaw\u2019s foundational objection, the order stated that the court\nsustained \u201cthe objections.\u201d It further stated that Christian\u2019s\n\f                                  - 785 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                        PAW K.

He alleged that the district court erred\nin (1) denying his motion to vacate when the district court\ndid not have personal jurisdiction over him, (2) denying his\nmotion to vacate when he was not served with the order con-\ntaining the hearing date until after the hearing had occurred,\nand (3) refusing to receive his affidavit.\n   In a published opinion, 2 the Court of Appeals affirmed. It\ndetermined that Christian \u201cwaived personal jurisdiction\u201d 3 and\nthat the district court properly sustained Paw\u2019s hearsay objec-\ntion to Christian\u2019s affidavit. The appellate court reasoned that\n\u201cChristian\u2019s affidavit was an out-of-court statement offered in\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that he\ndid not receive, or was not served, the order for hearing . . .\nuntil after the hearing had already occurred.\u201d 4 Christian filed\na timely petition for further review, which we granted.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Christian assigns, reordered, that the Court of Appeals erred\nin (1) holding that Christian waived personal jurisdiction in\nthe district court by not \u201c\u2018fil[ing] a motion to dismiss for\nlack of personal jurisdiction\u2019\u201d and not \u201c\u2018specifically stat[ing]\nin his request for hearing on the protection order that he was\nchallenging personal jurisdiction\u2019\u201d; (2) holding that Christian\nforfeited the issue of personal jurisdiction on appeal by not\nrequesting a bill of exceptions of the January 30, 2023, hear-\ning; and (3) finding no error in the district court\u2019s sustaining\nPaw\u2019s hearsay objection to Christian\u2019s affidavit.\n2\n  Id.\n3\n  Id. at 327, 997 N.W.2d at 92.\n4\n  Id. at 331, 997 N.W.2d at 94.\n\f                             - 786 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                     PAW K.

The Court of Appeals determined that\nChristian waived that defense because he did not file a motion\nto dismiss on that ground or specifically state in his request\nfor hearing that he was challenging personal jurisdiction.

We reject\nthese positions.\n   [9,10] An affidavit is one mode by which testimony of wit-\nnesses may be taken. 17 But an affidavit is regarded as the least\nsatisfactory mode of presenting testimony. 18 Affidavits are\nordinarily not considered competent evidence because they are\nnot subject to cross-examination, they combine facts and con-\nclusions, and they often omit or distort important facts. 19 An\naffidavit is competent evidence where authorized by statute or\nwhere not objected to on proper grounds by the party against\nwhom it is offered. 20 In the absence of statutory permission,\nan affidavit is not competent evidence, although made under\noath, because it is hearsay. 21\n   [11] Nebraska authorizes use of an affidavit for certain\npurposes. A statute specifically provides that \u201c[a]n affidavit\nmay be used to verify a pleading, to prove the service of a\nsummons, notice or other process, in an action, to obtain a\nprovisional remedy, an examination of a witness, a stay of pro-\nceedings, or upon a motion, and in any other case permitted\nby law.\u201d 22 This less satisfactory mode of presenting evidence\nis \u201c\u2018specially provided for to meet considerations of con-\nvenience or necessity.\u2019\u201d 23 Over a century ago, we remarked\nthat \u201c[t]he long-established practice has been to prove facts\n17\n   See Neb.

That statute specifies that \u201c[a]n affidavit may be\nused,\u201d 31 but it does not mandate the affidavit\u2019s admission\ninto evidence. Nor does a statute exempt such an affidavit\nfrom the rules of evidence. Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 27-101 (Reissue\n2016) provides that the Nebraska Evidence Rules \u201cgovern\nproceedings in the courts of [this state], except to the extent\nand with the exceptions stated in [Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7] 27-1101\n[(Reissue 2016)].\u201d Relevant to the facts of this case, the lat-\nter statute instructs that the Nebraska Evidence Rules apply\nto district courts 32 and that they apply generally to all civil\nproceedings. 33 Section 27-1101(4), which identifies situations\nin which the rules of evidence do not apply, does not include\na hearing on a motion to vacate.\n   [12] A statute such as \u00a7 25-1244 allowing an affidavit to be\nused upon a motion is general, and it leaves to the discretion\nof the trial judge whether it is appropriate to receive the affi-\ndavit into evidence. 34 Because we allow use of affidavits with\nrespect to collateral matters and disallow their use to prove\nfacts material to the issue in the case, the hearsay nature\nof the affidavit is typically of no import. In TransCanada\nKeystone Pipeline v. Nicholas Family, 35 we upheld the admis-\nsion of the affidavits with respect to attorney fees even\nthough it was \u201c\u2018beyond question\u2019\u201d that they contained hear-\nsay.

We cannot say that a trial\ncourt abuses its discretion by sustaining a hearsay objection\nto statements of third parties or to other averments not falling\nwithin a hearsay exception.\n   We recall the specific objection and ruling at the hearing on\nthe motion to vacate.

She elaborated:\n      On the original affidavit that was filed with this Court,\n      no email address is contained on this USPS alleged proof\n      that he didn\u2019t get service. And now, all of the sudden,\n      he has an affidavit that shows that email address. He\n      wouldn\u2019t have foundation to testify to that. And it, cer-\n      tainly, is hearsay.\nThe court stated that it was unaware of any authority refusing\nto apply the rules of evidence to the proceeding and then it\nsustained the hearsay objection.\n   The district court\u2019s corresponding written order expanded\non the foundational objection. It stated that Paw objected that\nthe affidavit was hearsay, that the affidavit did not lay founda-\ntion for the attachment, and that the attachment was altered\nand that the court \u201csustained the objections.\u201d According to\nthe order, Christian\u2019s argument \u201cdid not address the founda-\ntional issue with the attachment to the affidavit (or [Paw\u2019s]\nargument the attachment was altered)\u201d and that \u201ceven if the\naffidavit was received, the most it could show was that when\n[Christian] checked his mail in the afternoon of January 30,\n2023, the order for hearing was in his mail.\u201d\n   Thus, the critical question is whether the exhibit was partly\nadmissible and partly inadmissible.

Two rules exist, depending on whether the court\noverrules or sustains an objection.\n   Christian relies on the rules that it is not error to overrule\nan objection which is in part valid and in part invalid 37 and\nthat an objection to an exhibit as a whole is properly overruled\nwhere a part of the exhibit is admissible. 38 But here, the court\ndid not overrule the objection.\n   [13] Christian fails to cite the rule that when part of an\nexhibit is inadmissible, a trial court has discretion to reject the\nexhibit entirely or to admit the admissible portion. 39 Because\nit is the proponent\u2019s responsibility to separate the admissible\nand inadmissible parts when offering evidence, an appellate\ncourt will ordinarily uphold a court\u2019s exclusion of an exhibit\nif the proponent did not properly limit its offer to the part or\nparts that are admissible. 40\n   The portion of the email stating that it was transmitted\non January 30, 2023, at 7:24 a.m. and that \u201c[y]ou have mail\nand packages arriving soon\u201d and depicting the image of an\nenvelope from the clerk was hearsay.

Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. In reviewing a criminal\n                    conviction for a sufficiency of the evidence claim, whether the evidence\n                    is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the\n                    same: An appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,\n                    pass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and such\n                    matters are for the finder of fact. The relevant question for an appellate\n                    court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n                    to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\n                    tial elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                 2. Effectiveness of Counsel: Appeal and Error. Whether a claim of inef-\n                    fective assistance of counsel may be determined on direct appeal is a\n                    question of law.\n                 3. ____: ____. In reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on\n                    direct appeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\n                    facts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively deter-\n                    mine whether counsel did or did not provide effective assistance and\n                    whether the defendant was or was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged\n                    deficient performance.\n                 4. Juror Qualifications: Waiver. A party who fails to challenge the jurors\n                    for disqualification and passes the jurors for cause waives any objection\n                    to their selection.\n                 5. Criminal Law: Intent. The crime proscribed by Neb. Rev. Stat.\n                    \u00a7 28-311.01 (Reissue 2016) does not require an intent to execute the\n                    threats made; rather, it requires the intent to terrorize another as a result\n                    of the threats or a reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror.\n                 6. Criminal Law: Evidence: Intent. The intent with which an act is com-\n                    mitted is a mental process and may be inferred from the words and acts\n                    of the defendant and from the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\f                                    - 737 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     315 Nebraska Reports\n                               STATE V.

Washington,\n    466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the defendant\n    must show that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that\n    this deficient performance actually prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense.\n 8. Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof. To show that counsel\u2019s performance\n    was deficient, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance did not\n    equal that of a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in criminal law.\n 9. Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof: Words and Phrases. To show preju-\n    dice in a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must\n    demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient\n    performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n    A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confi-\n    dence in the outcome.\n10. Constitutional Law: Criminal Law: Jury Trials. The Sixth Amendment\n    secures to criminal defendants the right to be tried by an impartial jury\n    drawn from sources reflecting a fair cross-section of the community.\n11. Equal Protection: Jurors: Discrimination. The Equal Protection\n    Clause of the 14th Amendment forbids prosecutors from using\n    peremptory challenges to strike potential jurors solely on account of\n    their gender.\n12. Hearsay: Words and Phrases. Hearsay is a statement, other than one\n    made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n    evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n13. Hearsay. An out-of-court statement is not hearsay if the proponent\n    offers it for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted.\n14. Appeal and Error. An alleged error must be both specifically assigned\n    and specifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the error to be\n    considered by an appellate court.\n15. Pretrial Procedure: Pleadings: Evidence: Juries: Appeal and Error.\n    A motion in limine is a procedural step to prevent prejudicial evidence\n    from reaching the jury. It is not the office of a motion in limine to obtain\n    a final ruling upon the ultimate admissibility of the evidence. Therefore,\n    when a court overrules a motion in limine to exclude particular evi-\n    dence, the movant must object when the particular evidence is offered at\n    trial in order to predicate error before an appellate court.\n\n   Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Darla\nS.

INTRODUCTION\n   This is a direct appeal of convictions in the district court\nfor Lancaster County, Nebraska, for terroristic threats and\nthird degree sexual assault. The appellant argues that her trial\nbefore an all-male jury violated her constitutional rights to a\nfair trial and an impartial jury. The appellant also argues that\nthe evidence was insufficient to support her conviction for\nterroristic threats and that her trial counsel was ineffective in\nmultiple regards. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                      II. BACKGROUND\n   Early on the morning of January 14, 2020, Angelina M.\nClark entered the apartment where Shauna Parker and Parker\u2019s\n15-year-old son, A.L., resided. Clark knew Parker and A.L.\nand had visited their apartment previously. By her own admis-\nsion, Clark was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d when she entered the\napartment and during the events described below. 1\n   Parker testified that when Clark saw her, Clark asked,\n\u201c\u2018[D]o you know anything[?]\u2019\u201d Parker replied, \u201c\u2018[N]o I\ndon\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Parker explained that she understood Clark to be ask-\ning if she \u201cknew anything about having any drugs.\u201d However,\nParker acknowledged that Clark did not \u201cuse the word drugs.\u201d\nParker explained that she had just understood Clark\u2019s inquiry\nthat way.\n   Parker testified that after Clark had been in the apartment\nfor several minutes, Parker offered her a ride to \u201cget her\nout of [the] house.\u201d Parker drove a pickup truck.

Clark was situated between Parker and A.L.\n   A.L. testified that during the drive, Clark placed her hand\non his \u201cupper thigh\u201d near his torso three to five times, \u201cgrop-\ning up towards [his] penis.\u201d According to A.L., the last time\nClark did so, she touched \u201c[his] private areas over [his] pants\u201d\nand then \u201cslightly squeezed\u201d before moving her hand back to\nhis thigh.\n   According to Parker, A.L. leaned away from Clark with a\n\u201chorrible look on his face.\u201d A.L.\u2019s expression prompted Parker\nto ask the reason for his discomfort. A.L. initially declined\nto answer until they dropped Clark off. However, Parker per-\nsisted in her questions, and A.L. eventually disclosed that\nClark \u201cma[de] him uncomfortable\u201d and that he did not \u201c\u2018like\n[Clark] touching [him].\u2019\u201d Parker and Clark then began to argue\nabout A.L.\n   Parker decided that Clark\u2019s ride was at an end and pulled\ninto the parking lot of a convenience store so Clark could\nget out of the truck. Parker testified that as she pulled in, she\nobserved Clark\u2019s hand on A.L.\u2019s \u201cinner thigh.\u201d\n   Parker demanded that Clark get out of the truck. Clark\ninitially refused, so Parker told A.L. to get out of the truck.\nParker testified that after exiting the vehicle and before going\ninto the convenience store, A.L. \u201cc[a]me around the truck\nand . . . said I feel violated mom. He said, \u2018she touched my\ndick.\u2019\u201d A.L. testified similarly that he came around the truck\nand told Parker that he \u201cfelt very uncomfortable and . . .\nneeded . . . Clark to leave.\u201d That was when Parker, by her\nown admission, \u201clost [her] temper.\u201d\n   When Clark subsequently got out of the truck and began\ncalling A.L.\u2019s name, Parker \u201cintervene[d]\u201d to keep Clark from\nfollowing A.L. into the store. Parker acknowledged that she\ninitiated a \u201cphysical confrontation\u201d with Clark by pushing or\nslapping her.\n   According to Parker, during that confrontation, Clark got\nback in the truck and \u201cstart[ed] rummaging through [it].\n\f                                   - 740 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

Clark left the scene before\nofficers arrived but was apprehended nearby. Clark was subse-\nquently charged with terroristic threats under Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-311.01 (Reissue 2016) and third degree sexual assault\nunder Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-320(1)(a) (Reissue 2016).

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] In reviewing a criminal conviction for a sufficiency of\nthe evidence claim, whether the evidence is direct, circum-\nstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the same: An\nappellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass\non the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and\nsuch matters are for the finder of fact. 3 The relevant question\nfor an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. 4\n   [2,3] Whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nmay be determined on direct appeal is a question of law. 5 In\nreviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct\nappeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\nfacts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively\ndetermine whether counsel did or did not provide effective\nassistance and whether the defendant was or was not preju-\ndiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. 6\n                        V. ANALYSIS\n               1. Trial Before All-Male Jury\n   Clark argues that she was deprived of her rights under the\n6th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution to a fair\ntrial and an impartial jury because she was tried before an\nall-male jury. Clark acknowledges that \u201c\u2018[d]efendants are not\n3\n  State v. Lorello, 314 Neb. 385, 991 N.W.2d 11 (2023).\n4\n  Id.\n5\n  State v.

State, 11 we rejected the\ndefendant\u2019s claim that his conviction should be reversed\nbecause after the trial was completed, one of the jurors was\ndiscovered to have been formerly convicted of a felony. In so\ndoing, we reasoned:\n      Great latitude is allowed the defendant upon the voir dire\n      examination to enable him to ascertain whether there is\n      any ground for objecting to the juror. He cannot waive\n      an objection of this nature, and, after taking his chances\n      of an acquittal before the jury selected, insist upon an\n      objection which he should have raised upon the impan-\n      eling of the jury, and, if he makes no effort to ascertain\n      whether a juror offered is qualified to sit, he must be held\n      to have waived the objection. 12\n   [4] Our subsequent opinions clarified that Turley holds that\n\u201cwhen a defendant, through diligence, is able to discover a\nreason to challenge a juror, the objection to the juror must\n7\n   Brief for appellant at 12 (quoting Taylor v.

Nor does she dis-\npute that her trial counsel failed to challenge the jurors for\ndisqualification at the trial and passed the jurors for cause. To\nthe contrary, Clark alleges that her trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive for failing to object to the all-male jury. Accordingly, we\nagree with the State that Clark waived any objection to the\nall-male jury. We will, however, discuss her claim that the all-\nmale jury violated her constitutional rights to a fair trial and\nan impartial jury further below in conjunction with her claims\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.\n                 2. Sufficiency of Evidence as\n                     to Terroristic Threats\n  Clark also argues that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport her conviction for terroristic threats. In particular,\nshe argues that there was \u201cno direct evidence that points to\n[her] intent to actually terrorize\u201d Parker and that her words\nand actions and the surrounding circumstances fail to show\nsuch intent. 16 The State, on the other hand, argues that during\n13\n   State v.

In other words,\nthe crime proscribed by \u00a7 28-311.01 does not require an intent\nto execute the threats made; rather, it requires the intent to\nterrorize another as a result of the threats or a reckless dis-\nregard of the risk of causing terror to another. 18 In turn, for\npurposes of the crime of terroristic threats, the intent to ter-\nrorize another is an intent to produce intense fear or anxiety\nin another. 19 The intent with which an act is committed is a\nmental process and may be inferred from the words and acts\nof the defendant and from the circumstances surrounding\nthe incident. 20\n   In the present case, there was uncontroverted testimony\nfrom Parker that she and Clark were involved in a \u201cphysical\nconfrontation\u201d and that in the course of that confrontation,\nClark threatened to have her \u201cbeat[en] . . . up\u201d by various\npersons before grabbing a box cutter and saying, \u201c[B]itch I\u2019m\ngoing to kill you.\u201d Parker also testified that she was \u201ccon-\ncerned for [her] safety\u201d and backed away from Clark.

Prior\nopinions have upheld convictions for terroristic threats where\nthe defendant displayed a weapon 22 and made statements like\n\u201c\u2018consider yourself next on my list for a bullet\u2019\u201d 23 or \u201c\u2018\u201c[n]ow\nyou are going to get yours.\u201d\u2019\u201d 24\n   Clark\u2019s primary basis for arguing that the requisite intent\ncannot be inferred from her words and acts and the surrounding\ncircumstances is apparently that she was \u201cheavily intoxicated\nwhen the incident occurred.\u201d 25 Clark relies on our 1990 opinion\nin State v.

Rev.\nStat. \u00a7 29-122 (Reissue 2016), which provides that intoxica-\ntion may not be considered in determining the existence of a\nmental state that is an element of a criminal offense unless the\ndefendant proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that he\nor she did not know that the substance was intoxicating when\nhe or she ingested it or that the substance was not voluntarily\ningested. Clark points to no evidence showing that on the night\nin question, she did not know she was ingesting alcohol or that\nshe did not voluntarily ingest alcohol. As such, the fact that\nClark was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d 27 cannot be seen to preclude\nher from having had the requisite intent to terrorize Parker and\nproduce intense fear or anxiety in Parker.\n\n               3. Clark\u2019s Claims of Ineffective\n                  Assistance of Trial Counsel\n   In addition, Clark assigns that her trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive for (1) failing to object to the all-male jury, (2) failing to\nobject on hearsay grounds to Parker\u2019s testimony about A.L.\u2019s\nstatements regarding the sexual assault, and (3) failing to file\na motion in limine to exclude Parker\u2019s testimony that Clark\nasked about purchasing drugs.\n   When a defendant\u2019s trial counsel is different from his or her\ncounsel on direct appeal, the defendant must raise on direct\nappeal any issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective performance\nwhich is known to the defendant or is apparent from the\nrecord; otherwise, the issue will be procedurally barred in a\nsubsequent postconviction proceeding. 28 However, the fact that\nan ineffective assistance of counsel claim is raised on direct\nappeal does not necessarily mean that it can be resolved. 29\nThe determining factor is whether the record is sufficient to\n27\n   Brief for appellant at 13.\n28\n   State v.

Washington, 32 the defend\u00ad\nant must show that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was defi-\ncient and that this deficient performance actually prejudiced\nthe defendant\u2019s defense. 33 To show that counsel\u2019s performance\nwas deficient, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s perform\u00ad\nance did not equal that of a lawyer with ordinary training\nand skill in criminal law. 34 To show prejudice in a claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient\nperformance, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. 35 A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\nto undermine confidence in the outcome. 36\n   A court may examine performance and prejudice in any\norder and need not examine both prongs if a defendant fails to\ndemonstrate either. 37\n            (a) Failing to Object to All-Male Jury\n   Clark argues that her trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to object to the all-male jury.

The State, in turn, argues that trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance was not deficient and that Clark cannot show\nthat she was prejudiced thereby.\n   Clark likens her situation to that of the defendant in Taylor\nv. Louisiana. 39 In Taylor, a state law barred women from\nbeing selected for jury service unless they had previously\nfiled a written declaration of their desire to be subject to jury\nservice. 40 As a result, even though women represented 53 per-\ncent of the citizens eligible for jury service in the defendant\u2019s\njudicial district, there were no females on the 175-person\nvenire drawn for jury service in his case. 41 The defendant\nchallenged his conviction by an all-male jury, arguing that\nthe all-male jury violated his 6th and 14th Amendment right\nto an impartial jury trial. 42 The U.S. Supreme Court agreed. 43\nThe Court reasoned that the selection of a petit jury from a\n\u201crepresentative cross section of the community is an essential\ncomponent of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d 44 and\nthat this fair-cross-section requirement was violated by the\n\u201csystematic exclusion of women\u201d from the jury in the defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s case. 45\n38\n   Brief for appellant at 16.\n39\n   Taylor, supra note 7.\n40\n   Id.\n41\n   Id.\n42\n   Id.\n43\n   Id.\n44\n   Id., 419 U.S. at 528.\n45\n   Id., 419 U.S. at 531.\n\f                                    - 749 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

B., 46\nwherein the U.S. Supreme Court found that the State\u2019s use of\nperemptory challenges to exclude men from the jury, based\nsolely on their gender, violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the 14th Amendment. The State used 9 of its 10 peremp-\ntory challenges to remove males. 47 As a result, the State\u2019s case\nseeking to establish the petitioner\u2019s paternity and obligate him\nto pay child support was tried before an all-female jury. 48\n   Clark argues that even though the all-male jury in her case\nwas not due to a rule excluding women, \u201cthe result was the\nsame\u201d as in Taylor and J. E. B. 49 She also argues that the same\n\u201cconcerns brought up in Taylor [and J. E.

Specifically, to establish a prima facie\nviolation of the fair-cross-section requirement under the Sixth\nAmendment, a defendant must show that the underrepresenta-\ntion of the group alleged to be excluded is due to systematic\nexclusion of the group in the jury selection process, among\nother things. 56 Similarly, in order to show that a prosecutor\nhas used peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner\nin violation of the 14th Amendment, a defendant must first\nmake a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised\nperemptory challenges on the basis of gender. 57\n   Clark does not point to any evidence that women were\nsystematically excluded during the jury selection process to\nwhich her trial counsel failed to object. Nor does Clark point\nto any evidence that the prosecutor exercised peremptory chal-\nlenges on the basis of gender to which her trial counsel failed\nto object. Instead, Clark invites us to presume that \u201csome-\nthing did not happen as it should have during jury selection\u201d\nfrom the fact that the jurors selected were all male. 58 Like\n54\n   See, e.g., State v.

The State also argues that\nClark cannot show that she was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to object to Parker\u2019s testimony about A.L.\u2019s statements,\nbecause that testimony was cumulative of other testimony.\n   [12,13] Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the\ndeclarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. 64 Hearsay is\nnot admissible unless otherwise provided for in the Nebraska\nEvidence Rules or elsewhere. 65 However, by definition, an\nout-of-court statement is not hearsay if the proponent offers\nit for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter\nasserted. 66 For example, statements are not hearsay to the\nextent that they are offered for context and coherence of other\nadmissible statements, and not for \u201c\u2018the truth or the truth of\nthe matter asserted.\u2019\u201d 67 Statements are also not hearsay if the\nproponent offers them to show their impact on the listener, and\nthe listener\u2019s knowledge, belief, response, or state of mind after\nhearing the statement is relevant to an issue in the case. 68\n   Turning to the seven statements made by Parker to which\nClark claims that her trial counsel should have objected, we\nagree with the State that those statements were not hearsay,\nbecause they were offered for context and coherence and to\nshow their impact on Parker, and not to prove that Clark sexu-\nally assaulted A.L.

Masters. 71 In Masters, we\nfound that testimony that the defendant \u201c\u2018had some type of\nconnection with drugs\u2019\u201d was so prejudicial that it required\nthe reversal of his conviction. 72 We emphasized, however, that\nthis outcome reflected the \u201cfactual context\u201d of that case. 73\n   [14] The present factual context is different. Most nota-\nbly, it is different in that Clark assigns as error only that her\ntrial counsel was ineffective for \u201cfail[ing] to file a [m]otion\nin [l]imine to keep out any statements regarding the pur-\nchase of drugs.\u201d She does not assign as error that her trial\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object to Parker\u2019s tes-\ntimony at trial, although she argues in her brief on appeal\nthat Clark \u201creceived ineffective assistance of counsel when\nthose statements were allowed in . . . without any objection\nby [t]rial [c]ounsel.\u201d 74 An alleged error must be both specifi-\ncally assigned and specifically argued in the brief of the party\nasserting the error to be considered by an appellate court. 75\nAs such, our review is limited to Clark\u2019s claim that her trial\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion in limine\nto exclude Parker\u2019s testimony.\n   [15] We find that even if trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to file a motion in limine, Clark cannot show that she\n69\n   Brief for appellant at 17.\n70\n   Id.\n71\n   State v.

A motion in limine is a procedural\nstep to prevent prejudicial evidence from reaching the jury. 76 It\nis not the office of a motion in limine to obtain a final ruling\nupon the ultimate admissibility of the evidence. 77 Therefore,\nwhen a court overrules a motion in limine to exclude par-\nticular evidence, the movant must object when the particular\nevidence is offered at trial in order to predicate error before an\nappellate court. 78 Here, however, Clark acknowledges that her\ntrial counsel did not object to Parker\u2019s testimony about Clark\u2019s\nalleged inquiry about drugs.\n   Accordingly, Clark cannot show that she suffered prejudice\nas a result of her trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion in\nlimine, because a motion in limine in and of itself, without\nany objection at trial, would have been futile, and Clark did\nnot assign that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nobject to the statement at trial. 79\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   Clark\u2019s claims that the all-male jury violated her constitu-\ntional rights, that there was insufficient evidence to support\nher conviction for terroristic threats, and that her trial counsel\nwas ineffective in multiple regards are without merit. As a\nresult, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                     Affirmed.\n76\n   Vaughn, supra note 64.\n77\n   Id.\n78\n   Id.\n79\n   See, e.g., State v.

Horne was\naccepted into a problem-solving court program. On several\noccasions during Horne\u2019s participation in the program, the\ndistrict court sanctioned Horne for his failure to comply with\nprogram requirements. Eventually, the State moved to remove\nHorne from the program due to additional failures to follow\nprogram requirements. Horne admitted to the alleged viola-\ntions, and the district court removed Horne from the program.\nThe district court then sentenced Horne to a term of imprison-\nment on the charge to which he had earlier pled guilty. Horne\nappeals, challenging his removal from the problem-solving\ncourt program, the fact that the district court did not order\na presentence investigation before sentencing him, and the\nlength of his sentence. We find no reversible error and there-\nfore affirm.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\nHorne\u2019s Guilty Plea; Entry Into\nWellness Court Program.\n   This case began when the State charged Horne with pos-\nsession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The charges arose\nfrom an incident in which Horne appeared on a video holding\na gun and making comments about killing himself.\n   Horne and the State later reached a plea agreement. Pursuant\nto the agreement, Horne pled guilty to an amended charge of\nattempted possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and\nthe State recommended that Horne be admitted to \u201cWellness\nCourt,\u201d a problem-solving court program administered by the\ndistrict court. In such programs, sentencing is deferred fol-\nlowing a guilty plea and the defendant instead participates in\na program that includes treatment, supervision, and judicial\noversight. See State v. Shambley, 281 Neb. 317, 795 N.W.2d\n884 (2011). See, also, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-1302 (Reissue\n2016) (amended by 2023 Neb.

(rev. 2022).\nAfter successful completion of the program, participants are\noften permitted to withdraw their pleas and have their charges\ndismissed. See Shambley, supra. If, however, the participant\nis removed from the program or withdraws before success-\nful completion, the conviction stands and the case proceeds\nto sentencing on that conviction. See id. The district court\u2019s\nwellness court program is designed to assist defendants with\nmental health diagnoses.\n   The district court accepted Horne\u2019s guilty plea. It then con-\nfirmed on the record that Horne had read and reviewed with his\nattorney a contract governing the terms of his participation in\nthe wellness court program. The district court also confirmed\nthat Horne agreed to adhere to the requirements of the con-\ntract and that he understood that a failure to do so could result\nin removal from the program. The district court additionally\nadvised Horne that if he was removed from the program, he\ncould be sentenced on the charge to which he had pled guilty.\nThe district court accepted Horne into the wellness court pro-\ngram and released him on a signature bond. The full contract\ngoverning Horne\u2019s participation in the wellness court program\nis not included in the record on appeal.\n   In a journal entry and order memorializing the hearing at\nwhich Horne pled guilty and was accepted into the wellness\ncourt program, the district court stated that Horne had volun-\ntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to a pre-\nsentence investigation.\n\nWellness Court Program.\n   Horne began participating in the wellness court program\nshortly after the district court accepted him into the program\nin April 2021. As part of the wellness court program, Horne\nhad frequent status hearings in the district court. During those\nhearings, Horne reported on his weekly schedule, his progress\ntoward certain personal goals, and his meetings with proba-\ntion officers and therapists. During several of those status\n\f                               - 769 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE V. HORNE\n                         Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nhearings, the district court sanctioned Horne for violations of\nprogram requirements, including missed drug tests, missed\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings, dishonesty with probation\nofficers, and not completing community service hours ordered\nby the district court.\n   At one point during Horne\u2019s participation in the well-\nness court program, he admitted to \u201ca relapse.\u201d To address\nthe relapse, the district court ordered Horne to move into a\nstructured living facility. When Horne failed to move into a\nstructured living facility despite program staff notifying him\nof an opening, the district court ordered Horne to move into\nthe facility or, if the space was no longer available, to report to\nthe county jail for a 1-day jail sanction. The record indicates\nthat Horne failed to report as ordered, and the district court\nordered a jail sanction.\n   As a result of Horne\u2019s failure to follow directions of the\ndistrict court, the district court eventually ordered Horne to\nremain in the county jail until a bed became available at a resi-\ndential treatment facility. When a bed became available, Horne\nwas released to the facility, but was ordered to immediately\nreport to the county jail if he failed to successfully complete\ntreatment. Horne left the treatment facility without success-\nfully completing treatment and failed to report to jail. Horne\nlater failed to appear at a status hearing, and the district court\nissued a warrant for his arrest. Horne was arrested and again\nplaced in the county jail.\n   Horne was subsequently placed in another treatment facil-\nity and ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device at all times.\nAfter Horne was unsuccessfully discharged from this treat-\nment facility, the State filed a motion in October 2022 seeking\nHorne\u2019s termination from the wellness court program. In the\nmotion, the State alleged multiple violations of Horne\u2019s well-\nness court program contract. The motion alleged that Horne\nhad failed to appear for a wellness court program hearing;\nthat he had tested positive for marijuana while at his latest\nresidential treatment facility, but denied using; that he had\n\f                              - 770 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nremoved his GPS monitoring device; and that he had failed to\nreport directly to the county jail as required after his unsuc-\ncessful discharge from the treatment facility. A warrant was\nagain issued for Horne\u2019s arrest, and he was arrested.\nRemoval From Wellness Court\nProgram and Sentencing.\n   At a hearing on the motion to terminate Horne from the\nwellness court program, Horne admitted to the allegations in\nthe State\u2019s motion. After accepting Horne\u2019s admissions, the\ndistrict court set another hearing for \u201cdisposition.\u201d\n   The district court began the subsequent hearing by asking\nHorne\u2019s counsel if there was \u201cany legal reason why we can\u2019t\nproceed to disposition.\u201d Horne\u2019s counsel said there was no\nsuch reason. The district court then stated that \u201calthough a\npresentence investigation report was not completed,\u201d it would\ntake judicial notice of the State\u2019s motion to remove Horne\nfrom the wellness court program and would receive as exhibits\nthe affidavit of probable cause for Horne\u2019s initial arrest, as\nwell as a document summarizing Horne\u2019s criminal history.\n    Horne\u2019s counsel, when given the opportunity to address\nthe district court, acknowledged that Horne \u201cattempted to\nparticipate\u201d in the wellness court program but \u201cdid so with\nnot a whole lot of success.\u201d He argued that Horne should be\npermitted to remain in the wellness court program or should\nbe sentenced to a term of probation on the charge to which\nhe pled.\n   The district court declined to allow Horne to remain in the\nwellness court program. On the charge to which Horne pled\nguilty, the district court sentenced him to 6 to 20 years\u2019 impris-\nonment with credit for time he had already served.\n   Horne timely appealed, and we moved the case to our\ndocket.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Horne assigns three errors. We have paraphrased those\nerrors as follows: the district court erred by (1) removing him\n\f                                - 771 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE V. HORNE\n                          Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nfrom the wellness court program, (2) sentencing him without\nfirst ordering a presentence investigation, and (3) imposing an\nexcessive sentence.\n                    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] We have not previously addressed the standard of\nreview that applies to a defendant\u2019s challenge to removal\nfrom a problem-solving court program. The Nebraska Court of\nAppeals has held that a defendant\u2019s removal from a problem-\nsolving court program is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\nSee State v. Seaman, 28 Neb. App. 667, 947 N.W.2d 589\n(2020). We agree. Deciding whether to remove a defendant\nfrom a problem-solving court program is much like decid-\ning whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation or choosing a\nsentence within the prescribed statutory range. Each depends\nupon a trial court\u2019s \u201cunique familiarity with the facts and cir-\ncumstances of a case and its judgment in balancing a host of\nincommensurate and disparate considerations.\u201d U.S. v. Ruiz-\nTerrazas, 477 F.3d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 2007). We review a\ndecision to revoke probation, and a sentence imposed within\nstatutory limits, for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., State v. Ezell,\n314 Neb. 825, 993 N.W.2d 449 (2023) (sentencing); State v.\nJohnson, 287 Neb. 190, 842 N.W.2d 63 (2014) (revocation of\nprobation). We believe it appropriate to apply the same stan-\ndard to a termination from a problem-solving court.\n   [2,3] A sentence imposed within statutory limits will not\nbe disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court. State v. Alkazahy, 314 Neb. 406, 990\nN.W.2d 740 (2023). An abuse of discretion takes place when\nthe sentencing court\u2019s reasons or rulings are clearly untenable\nand unfairly deprive a litigant of a substantial right and a just\nresult. Id.\n                        ANALYSIS\nRemoval From Wellness Court Program.\n  Horne argues that the district court erred by removing\nhim from the wellness court program. Horne primarily argues\n\f                              - 772 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nthat the conduct underlying his conviction supports continued\nparticipation in the wellness court program rather than a term\nof incarceration. While he admits to \u201csome struggles\u201d with the\nwellness court program, he argues he has attempted to fulfill\nits requirements and the district court should have allowed him\nto remain in the program. Brief for appellant at 21.\n   Saying that Horne\u2019s had \u201csome struggles\u201d in the well-\nness court program is an understatement. As detailed above,\nHorne violated requirements of the wellness court repeat-\nedly. He missed drug tests; he was dishonest with probation\nofficers; he failed to complete ordered community service;\nhe missed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; he did not report\nto a structured living facility as ordered; he spent time in the\ncounty jail as a result of sanctions; he failed to successfully\ncomplete multiple residential treatment programs; he failed\nto report to jail as ordered after leaving a treatment program;\nhe tested positive for marijuana, and then he denied using\nwhile at a residential treatment program; he removed his\ncourt-ordered GPS monitoring device. On several occasions,\nthe district court reminded Horne of the need to follow the\nprogram\u2019s requirements. Furthermore, the district court made\nclear to Horne when he entered the program that he could be\nremoved from the program if he failed to comply with the pro-\ngram\u2019s requirements.\n   Horne\u2019s argument in this case appears to be that he deserves\none more chance to comply with the requirements of the well-\nness court program. In particular, he points to a residential\ntreatment program he has not yet entered and argues he\nshould be allowed to remain in the wellness court program\nand be placed there. We must keep in mind, however, our\nabuse of discretion standard of review. A judicial abuse of\ndiscretion exists only when the reasons or rulings of a trial\njudge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a\nsubstantial right and denying a just result in matters submitted\nfor disposition. State v. Ramirez, 314 Neb. 419, 990 N.W.2d\n550 (2023). In applying that standard of review here, we\n\f                              - 773 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nare particularly hesitant to second-guess the district court\u2019s\ndecision to remove Horne from the wellness court program,\nin light of the substantial firsthand knowledge of Horne it\nhad through his participation in the program. Given Horne\u2019s\nmultiple failures to comply with the requirements of the well-\nness court program and the district court\u2019s familiarity with\nHorne, we cannot say the district court\u2019s decision in this case\nconcluding \u201cenough was enough\u201d was untenable. We thus\nconclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nremoving Horne from the wellness court program.\nLack of Presentence Investigation Report.\n   Horne next argues that the district court erred by imposing a\nsentence without first ordering a presentence investigation. He\nargues such an investigation was required by Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 29-2261(1) (Cum. Supp. 2022). That subsection provides, in\nrelevant part, as follows:\n      Unless it is impractical to do so, when an offender has\n      been convicted of a felony other than murder in the\n      first degree, the court shall not impose sentence without\n      first ordering a presentence investigation of the offender\n      and according due consideration to a written report of\n      such investigation.\n   Horne argues that decisions of this court have established\nthat it is mandatory for a district court to consider a pre-\nsentence investigation report in sentencing unless such an\ninvestigation would be impractical or the record demonstrates\nthe defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of a\npresentence investigation. Horne claims that an investigation\nwould not have been impractical here and that the record\ndoes not show that he knowingly and intelligently waived a\npresentence investigation. The State counters by arguing that,\nunder the circumstances, an investigation was impractical and\nthat Horne knowingly and intelligently waived his right to\nan investigation.\n   [4] Before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments, we address\nanother issue: the fact that Horne made no objection to the\n\f                              - 774 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nsentence being imposed without a presentence investiga-\ntion, even after the district court announced on the record\nthat \u201ca presentence investigation report was not completed.\u201d\nGenerally speaking, we will not review an issue for prejudi-\ncial error if the party fails to make a timely objection in the\ncourt below. See State v. Childs, 309 Neb. 427, 960 N.W.2d\n585 (2021). Under most circumstances, we require a party to\nobject to a perceived error by a trial court in order to preserve\nthat issue for appeal. State v. McSwine, 292 Neb. 565, 873\nN.W.2d 405 (2016). As we have occasionally articulated the\nprinciple, \u201c[o]ne cannot silently tolerate error, gamble on a\nfavorable result, and then complain that one guessed wrong.\u201d\nIn re Interest of Samantha L., 286 Neb. 778, 787, 839 N.W.2d\n265, 272 (2013). See, also, State v. Kruse, 303 Neb. 799, 808,\n931 N.W.2d 148, 155 (2019) (\u201c[a]s a general rule, an appellate\ncourt will not consider an argument or theory that is raised for\nthe first time on appeal\u201d). Usually, when a party fails to object\nto an alleged error by the trial court, we will, at most, review\nthe issue for plain error. See McSwine, supra. See, also, State\nv. Roth, 311 Neb. 1007, 1014, 977 N.W.2d 221, 228 (2022)\n(\u201c[c]onsideration of plain error occurs at the discretion of an\nappellate court\u201d).\n   Our rule limiting appellate review when an issue was\nnot brought to the attention of the trial court serves impor-\ntant purposes. As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained,\nrules circumscribing review in the absence of a trial court\nobjection \u201cencourage all trial participants to seek a fair and\naccurate [proceeding] the first time around.\u201d United States\nv. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1\n(1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way,\nrules limiting appellate review in the absence of a trial court\nobjection incentivize trial court objections \u201cso that any errors\ncan be corrected before their full impact is realized.\u201d State\nv. Pearson, 775 N.W.2d 155, 161 (Minn. 2009). At the same\ntime, appellate courts\u2019 limited discretion to recognize plain\nerror even in the absence of a lower court objection serves\n\f                              - 775 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nas a backstop to potential injustice. See Hormel v. Helvering,\n312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S. Ct. 719, 85 L. Ed. 1037 (1941) (\u201c[a]\nrigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which\ncourts of review would invariably and under all circumstances\ndecline to consider all questions which had not previously\nbeen specifically urged would be out of harmony with . . .\nrules of fundamental justice\u201d).\n   Horne cannot dispute that it would be consistent with our\nrules regarding trial court objections, as well as the purposes\nthose rules serve, to limit our review on this assignment of\nerror to whether the district court plainly erred by not order-\ning a presentence investigation. We anticipate, however, that\nHorne would contend that precedent in prior cases involving\n\u00a7 29-2261(1) establishes that we should not limit our review\nin this manner. As we will explain, we disagree.\n   In a line of prior cases, this court has explored whether\nand under what circumstances a defendant can waive an argu-\nment that a trial court erred by not completing a presentence\ninvestigation contemplated by \u00a7 29-2261(1). That line of cases\nbegins with State v. Hiross, 211 Neb. 319, 318 N.W.2d 291\n(1982). In that case, the trial court informed the defendant that\nit was willing to order a presentence investigation in a mis-\ndemeanor case, but the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the court\nthat the defendant did not want a presentence investigation\nand desired to waive the trial court\u2019s offer to obtain one. When\nthe defend\u00adant subsequently argued on appeal that the trial\ncourt erred by not ordering a presentence investigation, this\ncourt concluded that the defendant had \u201cwaived the court\u2019s\noffer\u201d of a presentence investigation and was thus \u201cnot now in\na position to claim error.\u201d Id. at 320, 318 N.W.2d at 292.\n   A few years later in State v. Tolbert, 223 Neb. 794, 394\nN.W.2d 288 (1986), both the defendant and her counsel\ninformed the trial court that they wished to waive the presen-\ntence investigation. After the trial court imposed a sentence\nwithout completing a presentence investigation, however, the\ndefendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred by\n\f                              - 776 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nnot ordering a presentence investigation. Although this court\nultimately held that the trial court was not required to order\na presentence investigation because doing so would have\nbeen impractical, we, citing Hiross, supra, also noted that a\ndefend\u00adant can waive an objection to a trial court\u2019s decision\nnot to order a presentence investigation.\n   Over two decades later in State v. Qualls, 284 Neb. 929,\n824 N.W.2d 362 (2012), we were confronted with yet another\ncase in which the defendant informed the trial court that he\ndesired to waive a presentence investigation and the trial\ncourt proceeded to impose a sentence without ordering one. In\nQualls, the defendant later argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred by failing to adequately advise him that he was entitled\nto have a presentence investigation completed and for the trial\ncourt to consider the report of that investigation in crafting a\nsentence. In our opinion, we noted that \u00a7 29-2261(1) generally\nmakes presentence investigations mandatory in felony cases,\nbut citing Tolbert, supra, we noted that we had held that a\ndefendant can waive a presentence investigation. We observed\nthat while we had held that an otherwise mandatory presen-\ntence investigation can be waived, we had not previously\naddressed how such a waiver could be effectuated. Relying\non general propositions regarding waiver and the standards by\nwhich defendants may waive constitutional rights to counsel\nand to be present at trial, we ultimately held that a defendant\ncan waive a presentence investigation under \u00a7 29-2261(1) if\n\u201cit is apparent from the record that the defendant\u2019s relinquish-\nment of the right was knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d\nQualls, 284 Neb. at 933, 824 N.W.2d at 365. We later applied\nthis standard to find that a defendant waived a presentence\ninvestigation in State v. Iddings, 304 Neb. 759, 936 N.W.2d\n747 (2020).\n   We do not understand the line of cases we have just dis-\ncussed as exempting defendants who raise an argument\nbased on \u00a7 29-2261(1) from our usual rule requiring a timely\nobjection in the trial court to preserve an issue for full\n\f                              - 777 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nappellate review. Those cases addressed whether and how a\ndefendant can effectuate a waiver of a presentence investiga-\ntion. But our rule limiting review without a timely objection\nin the trial court is not, strictly speaking, a waiver rule, but,\nrather, a rule of forfeiture.\n   As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[w]aiver is\ndifferent from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure to\nmake the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the inten-\ntional relinquishment . . . of a known right.\u201d United States v.\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). See, also, Freytag\nv. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 894 n.2, 111 S. Ct. 2631,\n115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring) (observing\nthat waiver and forfeiture are \u201creally not the same\u201d); U.S. v.\nStaples, 202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[w]here waiver\nis accomplished by intent, forfeiture comes about through\nneglect\u201d). We acknowledge that this court, like many others,\nhas not always used these terms precisely. Compare, e.g., State\nv. Collins, 281 Neb. 927, 799 N.W.2d 693 (2011) (discuss-\ning cases in which failures to assert objections were found to\nwaive objections), with State v. Kennedy, 224 Neb. 164, 170,\n396 N.W.2d 722, 726 (1986) (\u201c[a] waiver is the voluntary\nand intentional relinquishment of a known right, privilege, or\nclaim\u201d). See, also, Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of\nChicago, 583 U.S. 17, 20 n.1, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d\n249 (2017) (\u201c[t]he terms waiver and forfeiture\u2014though often\nused interchangeably by jurists and litigants\u2014are not synony-\nmous\u201d); Freytag, supra (Scalia, J., concurring); U.S. v. Noble,\n762 F.3d 509, 528 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that courts have\nused the terms \u201crather loosely\u201d). Despite occasional linguis-\ntic imprecision in discussing waiver and forfeiture, there are\nmeaningful distinctions between the concepts. See Noble, 762\nF.3d at 528 (waiver and forfeiture have \u201cdifferent meanings\nand difference consequences\u201d).\n   One of the ways in which the distinction between waiver\nand forfeiture is meaningful is that when a party truly and\n\f                              - 778 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\neffectively waives a right, there can be no error in failing\nto honor that right and no appellate review is available. See\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 733 (\u201c[b]ecause the right to trial is waiv-\nable, and because the defendant who enters a valid guilty\nplea waives that right, his conviction without a trial is not\n\u2018error\u2019\u201d); Staples, 202 F.3d at 995 (\u201c[w]aiver extinguishes\nthe error and precludes appellate review\u201d). The same is not\nnecessarily true for forfeiture. In Nebraska, as in the federal\nsystem, a party can forfeit an argument by failing to timely\nassert it, yet there is still the possibility that a court could\nfind that the trial court committed error on plain error review.\nSee, Olano, supra; State v. Roth, 311 Neb. 1007, 977 N.W.2d\n221 (2022). Thus, by addressing waiver in State v. Qualls,\n284 Neb. 929, 824 N.W.2d 362 (2021), we were determining\nwhat a defendant must do to completely give up any right to\ncontend on appeal that the trial court erred by not ordering a\npresentence investigation. We did not address in Qualls how\na defendant might, by failing to object to the lack of a presen-\ntence investigation, forfeit the right to full appellate review\nof that issue.\n   We are aware that some rights (such as the constitutional\nrights to counsel and trial by jury) can be waived, but can-\nnot be given up through mere forfeiture.

See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S.\n218, 237, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973) (\u201c[a]lmost\nwithout exception, the requirement of a knowing and intel-\nligent waiver has been applied only to those rights which the\nConstitution guarantees to a criminal defendant in order to\npreserve a fair trial\u201d).\n   [5] Having determined to limit our review to plain error, we\nturn to whether plain error should be found here. We have said\nthat plain error may be found on appeal when an error unas-\nserted or uncomplained of at trial, but plainly evident from the\nrecord, prejudicially affects a litigant\u2019s substantial right and,\nif uncorrected, would result in damage to the integrity, repu-\ntation, and fairness of the judicial process. State v. McSwine,\n292 Neb. 565, 873 N.W.2d 405 (2016). We have additionally\nobserved that plain error \u201cis not a vehicle that should be rou-\ntinely used to \u2018save\u2019 an issue for appeal where a proper objec-\ntion should have been, but was not, made at trial.\u201d Id. at 583,\n873 N.W.2d at 418.\n   Even assuming for the sake of argument that Horne could\nshow that it is plainly evident from the record that the district\ncourt should have ordered a presentence investigation, we\ndecline to find plain error here. We initially note that there is\nsome indication in the record that Horne did, in fact, waive\na presentence investigation. As mentioned above, the district\ncourt stated in a journal entry made at the time of Horne\u2019s plea\nthat he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived\nhis right to a presentence investigation. And although the\nverbatim transcript of the plea hearing does not include any\ndiscussion of a presentence investigation, at oral argument,\nHorne\u2019s counsel acknowledged the possibility that a waiver of\na presentence investigation was a standard term in the wellness\ncourt program contract that Horne signed but is not a part of\nthe record on appeal.\n\f                              - 780 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\n   More importantly, this is not a case in which the district\ncourt lacked critical information about a defendant at sentenc-\ning. As part of the wellness court program, the district court\nhad the opportunity to observe Horne and regularly commu-\nnicate with him about subjects such as his family, his employ-\nment, and his treatment from his entry in the program in April\n2021 until the State filed its motion to remove him from the\nprogram in January 2023. Furthermore, if there was additional\ninformation that Horne felt was relevant to the district court\u2019s\nsentencing decision, we see no reason why Horne could not\nhave offered that information prior to sentencing. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot say that it would result in damage\nto the integrity, reputation, and fairness of the judicial process\nif we allowed Horne\u2019s sentence to stand despite the lack of a\npresentence investigation. See McSwine, supra.\nExcessive Sentence.\n   Horne\u2019s final argument is that the district court imposed an\nexcessive sentence. He does not dispute that his sentence was\nwithin statutory limits, but asserts that the district court none-\ntheless abused its discretion in fashioning a sentence.\n   We have on numerous occasions set forth the various fac-\ntors that a sentencing judge is to consider. See, e.g., State v.\nThomas, 311 Neb. 989, 977 N.W.2d 258 (2022). Horne argues\nthat in his case, those factors weighed in favor of a sentence of\nprobation rather than incarceration if Horne was not allowed\nto continue in the wellness court program. Mindful that it is\nnot our function to conduct a de novo review of the record to\ndetermine what sentence we would impose, see State v. Pauly,\n311 Neb. 418, 972 N.W.2d 907 (2022), we find that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Horne.\n                        CONCLUSION\n   Because we find no reversible error on the part of the dis-\ntrict court, we affirm.\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\f","Nebraska Supreme Court Online Library\nwww.nebraska.gov\/apps-courts-epub\/\n01\/19\/2024 09:08 AM CST\n\n\n\n\n                                                         - 756 -\n                               Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                                        315 Nebraska Reports\n                                                   STATE V.

Regardless of whether\n                    the evidence is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, and\n                    regardless of whether the issue is labeled as a failure to direct a verdict,\n                    insufficiency of the evidence, or failure to prove a prima facie case, the\n                    standard is the same: In reviewing a criminal conviction, an appellate\n                    court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass on the credibility\n                    of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence; such matters are for the finder\n                    of fact, and a conviction will be affirmed, in the absence of prejudicial\n                    error, if the evidence admitted at trial, viewed and construed most favor-\n                    ably to the State, is sufficient to support the conviction.\n                 6. Sentences: Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not disturb a sen-\n                    tence imposed within the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion\n                    by the trial court.\n                 7.

Sentences: Appeal and Error. Where a sentence imposed within the\n       statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court\n       must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in con-\n       sidering and applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal\n       principles in determining the sentence to be imposed.\n 9.    Criminal Law: Homicide: Evidence. To sustain a conviction for man-\n       slaughter, the evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\n       causal connection between the unlawful act and the death of the victim.\n10.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Prosecuting Attorneys: Proof. The same\n       conduct may constitute both unlawful act manslaughter and motor\n       vehicle homicide, and the State has the prosecutorial discretion to pur-\n       sue charges for either offense. But in exercising its discretion to charge\n       under one offense or another, the State must still prove each element of\n       that offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n11.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence. Contributory negligence is not\n       a defense to the charge of motor vehicle homicide. Rather, the issue is\n       whether a defendant\u2019s violation of the law was a contributing factor to\n       the death.\n12.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence: Proximate Cause. A victim\u2019s\n       negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a motor vehicle homi-\n       cide case unless the actions of the victim were the sole proximate cause\n       of the accident.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Lori\nA.

We affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   At approximately 9:25 p.m. on July 30, 2020, Tvrdy was\ntraveling eastbound in his Dodge Charger on what was then\nNebraska Highway 2 (now Nebraska Parkway) in Lincoln,\nNebraska. On this stretch of road, Highway 2 ran parallel\nto Pioneers Boulevard, which was accessed from the high-\nway via an access road. This access road then merged with\nPioneers Boulevard and continued eastbound. On this eve-\nning, Tvrdy sought to turn left across the westbound lanes\nof Highway 2 traffic. The intersection in question is not con-\ntrolled by a traffic light.\n   When Tvrdy approached the left turn, he slowed, waiting\nfor a car ahead of him to make the turn. Tvrdy then made the\nturn. While in the process of making the left turn, a motor-\ncycle operated by Brady Sweetser, traveling in the westbound\nlanes of Highway 2, collided with the passenger-side front\ndoor of Tvrdy\u2019s vehicle. Sweetser suffered blunt force trauma\nin the collision and died from his injuries. There was evidence\nat trial that Sweetser might have been speeding, including\ntestimony that a neighbor heard the throttling acceleration of\na motorcycle immediately prior to the sound of the collision,\nbut Sweetser\u2019s exact rate of speed was unknown.\n   Tvrdy was transported to a hospital with reports of head\npain. He also suffered several minor cuts and abrasions. Based\nupon the reports of law enforcement officials who responded\nto the scene of the collision, it was thought that Tvrdy might\nbe under the influence of some intoxicating substance. A\npreliminary breath test and other field sobriety tests were\nperformed. Following this drug investigation evaluation, the\nofficer conducting such tests concluded that it was her belief\nthat Tvrdy was under the influence of marijuana. A urine test\nlater showed the presence of \u201cTHC.\u201d\n\f                                - 759 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE V. TVRDY\n                          Cite as 315 Neb. 756\n\n   Tvrdy was initially charged with motor vehicle homicide\nwhile under the influence, a Class IIA felony. 1 The information\nagainst him was later amended to add a charge of unlawful\nact manslaughter, 2 with the unlawful act of driving under the\ninfluence, also a Class IIA felony. 3 The motor vehicle homicide\ncharge was dismissed prior to trial, and Tvrdy proceeded to\ntrial on only the manslaughter charge.\n   Following a jury trial, Tvrdy was found guilty of unlawful\nact manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 to 16 years\u2019 impris-\nonment. He appeals, and we moved this appeal to our docket.\n\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Tvrdy assigns that the district court erred in (1) using\njury instructions for motor vehicle homicide instead of man-\nslaughter, to Tvrdy\u2019s prejudice; (2) finding sufficient evidence\nto support Tvrdy\u2019s conviction; and (3) imposing an exces-\nsive sentence.\n\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1-4] Whether jury instructions are correct is a question of\nlaw, which an appellate court resolves independently of the\nlower court\u2019s decision. 4 In an appeal based upon a claim of\nan erroneous jury instruction, the appellant has the burden to\nshow that the questioned instruction was prejudicial or other-\nwise adversely affected a substantial right of the appellant. 5\nAll the jury instructions must be read together, and if, taken\nas a whole, they correctly state the law, are not misleading,\nand adequately cover the issues supported by the pleadings\nand the evidence, there is no prejudicial error necessitating\n1\n  See Neb.

According to statute, \u201cA\nperson commits manslaughter if he or she . . . causes the\ndeath of another unintentionally while in the commission of\nan unlawful act.\u201d 16 To sustain a conviction for manslaughter,\nthe evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\ncausal connection between the unlawful act and the death of\nthe victim. 17\n   [10] The same conduct may constitute both unlawful act\nmanslaughter and motor vehicle homicide, and the State\nhas the prosecutorial discretion to pursue charges for either\noffense. 18 But in exercising its discretion to charge under one\noffense or another, the State must still prove each element of\nthat offense beyond a reasonable doubt. 19\n   [11,12] It has been a longstanding principle that contribu-\ntory negligence is not a defense to the charge of motor vehicle\nhomicide. 20 Rather, the issue is whether a defendant\u2019s viola-\ntion of the law was a contributing factor to the death. 21 Thus,\na victim\u2019s negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a\nmotor vehicle homicide case unless the actions of the victim\nwere the sole proximate cause of the accident. 22 All the jury\ninstructions must be read together, and if, taken as a whole,\nthey correctly state the law, are not misleading, and adequately\ncover the issues supported by the pleadings and the evidence,\nthere is no prejudicial error necessitating reversal. 23\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the arguments\non appeal.

Instruction No. 3 concluded by noting\nthat \u201c[t]he burden of proof is always on the State to prove all\nof the material elements of the crime charged, and the burden\nnever shifts.\u201d We observe that this instruction is not challenged\non appeal.\n   Once again, we note instruction No. 5, which provides:\n           Under the law in Nebraska, the negligence of a victim\n        is not a defense to a prosecution for Manslaughter unless\n        such negligence is the sole proximate cause of the death.\n           Such negligence, if it exists, may be considered on the\n        issue of whether the conduct of [Tvrdy] was a proximate\n        cause of the death of [the victim].\nThis instruction is identical in substance to the instruction we\nset forth in State v. Brown, 24 wherein we suggested that the\nlanguage be used \u201cin such circumstances.\u201d\n   And although Brown involved a charge of motor vehicle\nhomicide, we disagree with Tvrdy\u2019s suggestion that while\nthe contributory negligence of the victim is not a defense\nto motor vehicle homicide, it is a defense to manslaugh-\nter. Contrary to Tvrdy, we do not read the Eighth Circuit\u2019s\nopinion in Schmidt to hold that contributory negligence is a\ndefense to manslaughter. 25 Instead, we read the Eighth Circuit\nto have said that evidence of a victim\u2019s negligence might\nbe relevant to whether the defendant proximately caused\nthe death at issue. In fact, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion, in\na footnote, expressly rejected the notion that contributory\nnegligence of the decedent was a defense to manslaugh-\nter. 26 Furthermore, ample authority suggests that contributory\n24\n   State v.

We\nagree that it was a correct statement of the law. We dis-\nagree with the assertion that the first sentence of instruction\nNo. 5 conflicts with the second sentence and that the jury\nwould have been confused about whether it could consider\nSweetser\u2019s own negligence. The first sentence simply notes\nthat this negligence would not be a defense to manslaughter,\nwhich is a correct statement of law. Moreover, this first sen-\ntence does not preclude the consideration of that evidence\u2014in\nfact, it invites the jury to do so when determining causation.\nThe second sentence makes it even more plain that the jury\nmay consider that evidence to determine causation.\n   When read with instruction No. 3, which was not chal-\nlenged, the instructions inform the jury that the State always\nretains the burden to prove the elements of unlawful act\nmanslaughter (as well as driving under the influence). These\nelements include causation, and the State must prove that\nTvrdy\u2019s actions, and not Sweetser\u2019s own negligence, were the\ncause of Sweetser\u2019s death.\n   An examination of the record shows that evidence of\nSweetser\u2019s possible acceleration\u2014both in the moments\nbefore the collision, as well as immediately preceding the\n27\n     See, People v.

Tvrdy\ncontends that the court abused its discretion when it failed to\nconsider Tvrdy\u2019s willingness to change, involvement in pro-\nsocial activities, education, and positive relationships.\n   Unlawful act manslaughter is a Class IIA felony, which is\npunishable by up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. As such, Tvrdy\u2019s\nsentence was within statutory limits. Moreover, the presen-\ntence report shows that Tvrdy has a criminal history entailing\nboth multiple speeding and possession of marijuana offenses,\nas well as a driving under the influence offense.

The defendant's convictions were affirmed\n\n by a panel of this court in 2011.           Commonwealth v. Middleton, 80\n\n Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2011).         In 2022, a panel of this court\n\n affirmed the denial of the defendant's second motion for a new\n\n trial in part and remanded the matter solely on the issue of\n\n whether, under the applicable Massachusetts standard, the\n\n failure of the Commonwealth to provide certain personnel records\n\n of Massachusetts State Police crime laboratory employees\n\n warranted a new trial.       Commonwealth v. Middleton, 101 Mass.\n\fApp. Ct. 1115 (2022).    On remand, the motion judge, utilizing\n\nthe proper standard, denied the defendant's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   In this appeal, the defendant contends that the motion\n\njudge erred in concluding that the Commonwealth's failure to\n\nprovide exculpatory evidence would not have made a difference in\n\nthe outcome of his trial.    We affirm.\n\n     Background.   We take the background facts from the judge's\n\nsummary of the evidence admitted at trial which is largely\n\nconsistent with the defendant's recitation of the facts, and\n\nwhere it is not, the judge's summary is supported by the record.\n\nAround midnight on January 11, 2005, S. M. and three of his\n\nfriends returned to S. M.'s home in Braintree to find two masked\n\nintruders inside looking for money and drugs.    Over the next\n\nhour, the intruders beat all four victims, ordered them to strip\n\nnaked, and bound them.    The masked men continued to beat S. M.\n\nwhile demanding money and drugs, beat one victim in the head\n\nwith a gun so severely he required stitches, threatened to kill\n\nall of the victims, forced one victim to take the defendant's\n\npenis into her mouth and perform oral sex, and threatened to\n\nrape a third victim.\n\n     During the assaults, the intruders heard someone pull into\n\nthe driveway of the home and they fled to the basement.    One of\n\nthe victims heard one of the intruders yelling, \"Bitch, you need\n\nto come pick us up\" and heard the two intruders communicating\n\n\n                                  2\n\fwith a Nextel two-way radio.   That victim remembered that at\n\nleast once during the assaults, he heard a female's voice on the\n\nother end of the Nextel.    Although none of the victims were able\n\nto identify either of the attackers (because they were masked),\n\nthe Commonwealth tied the defendant to the crimes using\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence, wiretap evidence, and the\n\ntestimony of a cooperating witness (Tia) who was present when\n\nthe defendant and codefendant planned and prepared for the\n\nrobbery, 1 and was also present with the defendant and co-\n\ndefendant after the assaults, when the co-defendant made\n\nincriminating statements.\n\n     After an investigation, the defendant was arrested in\n\nJanuary of 2005 and later indicted.   On separate dates and at\n\nseparate locations, the investigators gathered DNA samples of\n\nthe rape victim and the two co-defendants; the DNA samples were\n\nthen analyzed in the State Police Crime Laboratory (crime lab).\n\nCarol Courtright, a criminologist working at the crime lab,\n\ndetected sperm cells from the oral swab collected from the rape\n\nvictim.   Massachusetts State Trooper Bruce Tobin separately\n\nobtained buccal swabs of each of the co-defendants in the\n\n\n1 The witness testified that the day before the attack, she went\nfor a drive with both defendants. During the trip, co-defendant\nNicholson procured a shotgun and a bulletproof vest, and drove a\nfew times by the home where the victims were attacked while\ntalking about robbing the owner of money and marijuana.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fpresence of their attorneys.   Tobin individually labeled each\n\nbuccal swab and affixed the name of the defendant from whom he\n\ntook the sample, before he sealed and stored the swab at the\n\ncrime lab.   In late 2005, at the crime lab, Hillary Griffiths\n\ntook the three known samples and developed a DNA profile for\n\neach sample.   Another DNA analyst, Rachel Chow, analyzed the\n\nsperm that was preserved from the oral swab of the rape victim.\n\nChow determined that the male DNA profile from the oral swab of\n\nthe victim matched the DNA profile from the defendant's buccal\n\nswab.\n\n     In anticipation of the Commonwealth's introduction of the\n\nDNA evidence, defense counsel made pretrial discovery requests\n\nfor \"background information\" about each person involved in\n\nconducting or reviewing DNA testing in this case.   Before trial,\n\nthe Commonwealth produced information about Hilary Griffiths and\n\nRachel Chow including proficiency test results and resumes.     At\n\ntrial, the Commonwealth did not call Chow or Griffiths to\n\ntestify about the DNA, but rather the DNA evidence was presented\n\nthrough a supervisor of the DNA unit, Caitlin Drugan.   Drugan\n\ndid not perform the analysis but independently evaluated Chow's\n\nand Griffiths's work, confirmed their analyses, and offered her\n\nown opinion that the defendant was a statistical match for the\n\nDNA found in the rape victim's mouth.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f     More than a decade after the defendant was convicted, the\n\ndefendant's ongoing discovery efforts revealed additional,\n\npreviously undisclosed personnel file information about\n\nGriffiths's and Chow's employment at the crime lab.   This\n\nadditional information included documents dated in 2006, by\n\nwhich Griffiths and Chow were separately notified that they were\n\nsuspended from certain analytical duties.   The suspensions\n\nreferenced \"instances of DNA . . . discrepancies\" in the few\n\nmonths preceding the suspensions, and issues with their \"skill\n\nset to focus on tasks without sample mix-ups, as aliquots are\n\nnot placed in appropriate tubes\/rows.\"   As we noted in our\n\nAugust 12, 2022 decision, \"the personnel files also contained\n\ninformation prepared after the date of trial but that related to\n\nGriffiths's work performance at and around the time of her work\n\non the samples in this case -- a 2009 State Police report\n\nincluding indirect reports that Griffiths 'was not capable of\n\nperforming daily exemplar work until shortly before June 3,\n\n2008,' and indications from Griffiths in an undated transcript\n\nexcerpt and an e-mail exchange with a supervisor in 2013\n\nsuggesting that lab personnel were hiding mistakes made during\n\ntesting.\"   Middleton, 101 Mass. App. Ct. at 1115.\n\n     The defendant moved for a new trial based upon the\n\nCommonwealth's failure to produce exculpatory evidence.    Id.\n\nInitially, the defendant argued that Chow may have mixed up the\n\n\n                                 5\n\fDNA profiles and mistakenly identified the defendant, instead of\n\nNicholson, as the individual whose DNA matched the sperm DNA\n\nfound in the victim's mouth.    Upon learning that Chow did not\n\nhandle or analyze the exemplars of either Middleton or\n\nNicholson, the defendant changed his argument, instead claiming\n\nthat Griffiths may have mixed up the samples and mistakenly\n\ngenerated a DNA profile from Nicholson's sample and assigned it\n\nto Middleton.   The defendant contends that, despite the fact\n\nthat the DNA samples of each of the co-defendants were\n\nseparately collected and labeled by Trooper Tobin before being\n\nstored at the crime lab, Griffiths switched the exemplars of\n\nMiddletown and Nicholson.    The defendant claims that, had the\n\nevidence of the personnel files been timely provided to him, he\n\ncould have impeached Drugan's opinion testimony and it would\n\nhave had an impact on the outcome of the trial.\n\n     Discussion.   1.   Standard of review.     \"Under Mass. R. Crim.\n\nP. 30 (b), [as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001)], a judge may\n\ngrant a motion for a new trial at any time if it appears that\n\njustice may not have been done.\"       Commonwealth v. Williams, 89\n\nMass. App. Ct. 383, 387 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Scott,\n\n467 Mass. 336, 344 (2014).    \"We review a judge's decision to\n\ndeny a motion for a new trial without holding an evidentiary\n\nhearing 'for a significant error of law or other abuse of\n\ndiscretion.'\"   Commonwealth v. Upton, 484 Mass. 155, 162 (2020),\n\n\n                                   6\n\fquoting Commonwealth v. Bonnett, 482 Mass. 838, 843-844 (2019).\n\nIn our review for abuse of discretion \"must give great deference\n\nto the judge's exercise of discretion; it is plainly not an\n\nabuse of discretion simply because the reviewing judge would\n\nhave reached a different result.\"     L.L. v. Commonwealth, 470\n\nMass. 169, 185 n.27 (2014).   In other words, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion occurs if a judge makes \"'a clear error of judgment\n\nin weighing' the factors relevant to the decision'\" (citation\n\nomitted).   Id.   \"[W]e 'extend[ ] special deference to the action\n\nof a motion judge who was also the trial judge.'\"     Commonwealth\n\nv. Conley 103 Mass. App. Ct. 496, 512 (2023), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Grace, 397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986).\n\n     2.   Exculpatory evidence.   In order to obtain a new trial\n\non the basis of nondisclosed exculpatory evidence, \"a defendant\n\nmust establish (1) that the evidence [was] in the possession,\n\ncustody, or control of the prosecutor or a person subject to the\n\nprosecutor's control; (2) that the evidence is exculpatory; and\n\n(3) prejudice.\"   Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 487 Mass. 370, 375\n\n(2021).\n\n     As to the third element -- prejudice -- the motion judge\n\nanalyzed the defendant's request for \"background information\" of\n\nthe crime lab employees as a \"specific request.\"     When a motion\n\nfor a new trial is based upon a specific request for exculpatory\n\nevidence, \"a defendant need demonstrate only that a substantial\n\n\n                                  7\n\fbasis exists for claiming prejudice from the nondisclosure.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Pope, 489 Mass. 790, 801 (2022), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Tucceri, 472 Mass. 401, 412 (1992). 2     See\n\nCommonwealth v. Healy, 438 Mass. 672, 680 (2003), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Daye, 411 Mass. 719, 729 (1992) (\"In cases\n\ninvolving a specific request for evidence, we look to the record\n\nto determine 'whether we can be confident that even if the\n\nprosecution had supplied the report to the defendant[] in a\n\ntimely fashion, the report or available evidence disclosed would\n\nnot have influenced the jury'\").       The defendant bears the burden\n\nof establishing that he was prejudiced by the failure to\n\ndisclose the evidence.    See Commonwealth v. Imbert, 479 Mass.\n\n575, 583 (2018).\n\n     In her analysis, the judge applied the most favorable\n\nstandard of review for the defendant, but nevertheless denied\n\nhis second motion for a new trial.      On this record, we perceive\n\nno abuse of discretion.    The judge properly considered whether\n\nthe evidence, had it been disclosed, \"would have influenced\" the\n\njury, Daye, 411 Mass. at 729, and concluded that the defendant\n\nfailed to show that there was a \"reasonable possibility that the\n\n\n\n\n2 If the request for evidence is non-specific, the test is\n\"whether there is a substantial chance that the jury might not\nhave reached verdicts of guilt if the undisclosed evidence had\nbeen introduced in evidence.\" Tucceri, 412 Mass. at 413.\n\n\n                                   8\n\fnondisclosed evidence would have made a difference.\"   Imbert,\n\nsupra.\n\n     The judge carefully considered the nondisclosed evidence in\n\nthe context of the strength of the entire case against the\n\ndefendant.   Commonwealth v. Lykus, 451 Mass. 310, 329-330\n\n(2008).   The judge described how the DNA evidence was just a\n\npart of the Commonwealth's case against the defendant.   In\n\nparticular, Tia, a witness for the Commonwealth, testified at\n\ntrial that she and the defendant had been friends for a couple\n\nof years, and that the day before the home invasion she went on\n\na drive with the defendant and Nicholson.   Tia's testimony\n\nplaced the defendant in the car when they drove by S. M.'s home\n\nin Braintree and Nicholson spoke about robbing S. M. of money\n\nand marijuana.   On the drive Nicholson, who already had a\n\nhandgun in the car, retrieved a shotgun and a bulletproof vest.\n\nDuring the intrusion, Nicholson called Tia on the Nextel radio.\n\nLater, Tia asked Nicholson what happened with the female victim\n\nat the house and Nicholson laughed and told her \"it wasn't him.\"\n\nTia's testimony also placed the defendant in the car with\n\nNicholson and Tia the day after the home invasion, at which time\n\nNicholson threatened to kill Tia's mother, daughter, and Tia,\n\nherself, if Tia spoke to the police.\n\n     Furthermore, as the judge explained, it was Caitlyn Drugan,\n\nnot Griffiths or Chow, who testified at trial that the DNA of\n\n\n                                 9\n\fthe defendant matched the DNA of the sperm taken from the\n\nvictim's mouth. 3   The judge concluded that \"at no time up to and\n\nincluding the present (and despite having filed two motions for\n\na new trial and a revised motion) has the defendant actually\n\nidentified any errors in the DNA analysis . . . or offered any\n\nscientific basis for challenging its accuracy.\"    Moreover, the\n\njudge noted that, with the evidence provided, the defense was\n\nable to argue strenuously at trial that the jury should\n\ndisbelieve that Chow or Griffiths \"performed in a manner that\n\nwas appropriate\" and that \"there's no indication that the oral\n\nswab that was presented to the DNA lab was that of\n\nMr. Middleton[].\"    Although the additional personnel files no\n\ndoubt could have been used for additional impeachment, nothing\n\nin these documents indicated that the concerns with the work of\n\nChow or Griffiths had to do with their work on the defendant's\n\nsample, and more importantly, it remains that Drugan\n\nindependently reviewed the DNA testing and provided an opinion\n\nthat was subject to thorough cross-examination.\n\n     Simply put, the defendant's claim that Griffiths may have\n\nswapped the DNA samples of the defendant and Nicholson remains\n\n\n3 Drugan's opinion testimony at trial relating to the DNA\nevidence was upheld in an earlier ruling of this court because\nshe independently reviewed the DNA evidence. See Commonwealth\nv. Middleton, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 1110. The defendant's claim\nthat Drugan did not independently analyze the evidence is\nwithout support in the record.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fentirely speculative, with no grounding in the personnel files\n\nor in the other evidence presented or available.      Recognizing\n\nthe special deference we owe to the motion judge, who was the\n\ntrial judge and had a superior insight into how the jury reacted\n\nto Drugan's testimony and the defense's attacks upon it, we\n\ndiscern no error in her determination that there was not enough\n\nto establish a substantial basis for a claim of prejudice.\n\n                                      Order entered January 4,\n                                        2023, denying second motion\n                                        for new trial affirmed.\n\n                                      By the Court (Ditkoff,\n                                        Englander & Walsh, JJ. 4),\n\n\n\n                                      Assistant Clerk\n\n\nEntered:    January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n4   The panelists are listed in order of seniority.\n\n\n                                 11\n\f"]
