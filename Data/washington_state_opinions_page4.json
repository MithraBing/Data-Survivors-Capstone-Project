The court certifies to the\n    Secretary of State the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for the proposed\n    initiative petition.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925476/", "id": 9925476, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467638/da-davidson-v-slaybaugh/", "cluster_id": 9467638, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467638/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T14:06:39.750785-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T14:07:30.350789-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "e3a14ba130568dcc8654b3ae6053df35e779f93b", "page_count": 2, "download_url": "https://juddocumentservice.mt.gov/getDocByCTrackId?DocId=459394", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/d.a._davidson_v._slaybaugh.pdf", "plain_text": "                                                                                                         01/19/2024\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     Case Number: DA 23-0504\n\n\n\n\n                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MONTANA\n                    THE OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF SUPREME COURT\n                            HELENA, MONTANA 59620-3003\n\n                                           Supreme Court No.\n                                              DA 23-0504\n\nD.A.

The circuit court erred by sentencing the defendant as a Class\n             X offender, so the cause is remanded to the circuit court to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b62     On September 27, 2016, the State charged by information the defendant-appellant, Albert\n\nSmith, with three counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated\n\nbattery with a deadly weapon. On August 6, 2019, the circuit court conducted a jury trial of Mr.\n\nSmith on the aforementioned charges. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Mr. Smith\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nguilty of aggravated battery of a peace officer, and he was sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. On\n\nappeal, Mr. Smith argues that: (1) he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel for failing\n\nto provide an expert on cross-racial identification; (2) there was plain error committed during the\n\nState\u2019s closing arguments; and (3) the trial court erred by sentencing him as a Class X offender.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction and remand the cause to the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b63                                        BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On September 27, 2016, the State charged Mr. Smith by information with three counts of\n\naggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nMr. Smith elected to proceed via a jury trial on the charges. On August 6, 2019, the trial court\n\nconducted a jury trial. During the trial, the State called two primary occurrence witnesses: Chicago\n\nPolice Department Officer Terrence Pratcher and Chicago Police Department Officer Anthony\n\nRosen.\n\n\u00b65       Officer Pratcher testified that at the time of the trial, he had been working for the Chicago\n\nPolice Department for approximately 12 years. On May 26, 2016, Officer Pratcher was patrolling\n\nwith Officer Rosen and Officer Rick Caballero in an unmarked Ford Explorer when they were\n\napproached by their confidential informant about a black man selling drugs in a tan Cadillac,\n\nbearing partial license plate number \u201cE30\u201d on the 1600 block of Homan Avenue. At the time, the\n\nofficers were in plainclothes, which was a bulletproof vest with a police star, either on a chain or\n\nembroidered on their bulletproof vests. Though defense counsel objected to the admission of the\n\nstatement of the confidential informant, it was allowed for the limited purpose of the officers\u2019\n\nsubsequent actions. Officer Pratcher and his partners relocated to the area referenced by the\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nconfidential informant but did not see the vehicle. As a result, they drove around the area for about\n\n10 minutes looking for the car. About an hour later, while traveling southbound on Homan Avenue\n\nfrom 16th Street, they saw a parked car matching the description including the partial license plate,\n\n\u201cE30.\u201d When they drove past the vehicle and slowed down to make a U-turn, the black man they\n\nsaw in the driver seat of the vehicle drove away onto 16th Street. The officers followed slowly\n\nbehind the vehicle hoping it would stop but eventually lost sight of the vehicle. Then, they saw the\n\nvehicle parked around 3342 West Odgen and they parked next to the vehicle. All the officers exited\n\nthe vehicle, and Officer Pratcher went to the driver\u2019s side window, where he saw Mr. Smith, whom\n\nhe identified in court. Officer Pratcher knocked on the window and tried to get Mr. Smith to roll\n\ndown his window but Mr. Smith shook his head, \u201cno.\u201d Officer Pratcher then asked Mr. Smith to\n\nstep out of the vehicle and he again declined to do that. Instead, Mr. Smith started the car, shifted\n\nthe car into drive, and then turned the car in the direction of Officer Pratcher. Before Officer\n\nPratcher could move out of the way, the tan Cadillac quickly accelerated and hit him on his right\n\nleg. He ended up on the hood of the vehicle for about 10 feet, while the car traveled westbound on\n\nOgden, before falling off the hood. The other officers tried to run after the vehicle, which kept\n\ngoing, and then they checked on Officer Pratcher. Then, Officer Pratcher and his fellow officers\n\nentered their squad car, called dispatch about the description of the tan Cadillac, and drove around\n\nattempting to locate the Cadillac. Other officers found the car abandoned in a vacant lot.\n\n\u00b66     At the police station, about 30 minutes after Officer Pratcher was struck by the car, Officer\n\nRosen showed him a photograph, which he identified as the man who drove into him, Mr. Smith.\n\nOfficer Pratcher then went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with \u201cbruising and soft tissue\n\ndamage to [his] right leg.\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph was added to the wanted board for Officer\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nPratcher\u2019s police district. On cross-examination, he conceded that he did not view a photo array or\n\na lineup in this case.\n\n\u00b67      Officer Rosen testified to the same details that Officer Pratcher stated on his direct\n\nexamination, mainly the circumstances leading to the encounter with Mr. Smith, their attire that\n\nday, and also how Officer Pratcher was injured. He added the detail that when they approached\n\nthe parked car, before exiting the vehicle, he observed Mr. Smith was reclined all the way back in\n\nthe driver\u2019s seat of the tan Cadillac. He identified Mr. Smith in court. He looked up the license\n\nplate of the tan Cadillac in the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s database and received Mr. Smith\u2019s name\n\nand information. With that information, he pulled up Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph and confirmed he\n\nwas the driver of the tan Cadillac \u201cwhen it struck Officer Pratcher.\u201d\n\n\u00b68      After the close of the trial evidence, the jury found Mr. Smith guilty of aggravated battery\n\nto a peace officer and not guilty on the count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. On\n\nAugust 27, 2019, the trial court sentenced him to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The court found he was\n\nClass X eligible because of prior felony convictions. Mr. Smith mailed his notice of appeal to the\n\ncircuit court in a letter postmarked September 24, 2019.\n\n\u00b69                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10    We note that we have jurisdiction to consider this matter, as Mr. Smith filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 606 (eff. July 1, 2017); see also People v. English, 2023 IL\n\n128077, \u00b6 25.\n\n\u00b6 11    Mr. Smith argues that: (1) his trial counsel offered ineffective assistance of counsel when\n\ncounsel failed to call a cross-racial identification expert; (2) the State made improper comments\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nduring closing arguments; (3) the trial court erred by sentencing Mr. Smith as a Class X offender\n\nsince one of his predicate felonies was committed when he was a minor.\n\n\u00b6 12   To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ca defendant must show both\n\nthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n\ndefendant.\u201d People v. Petrenko, 237 Ill. 2d 490, 496 (2010). To establish deficient performance, a\n\ndefendant must show his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 219 (2004) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).\n\n\u201cEffective assistance of counsel refers to competent, not perfect representation.\u201d Evans, 209 Ill.\n\n2d at 219 (quoting People v. Stewart, 104 Ill. 2d 463, 491-92 (1984)). Mistakes in trial strategy or\n\ntactics do not necessarily render counsel\u2019s representation defective. See People v. Hayes, 2021 IL\n\nApp (1st) 172417, \u00b6 78 (finding that the decision to not file a motion to suppress is typically a\n\nmatter of trial strategy, in which courts of review give great deference to counsel\u2019s decision).\n\n\u00b6 13   To establish the second prong of Strickland, prejudice, a defendant must show that \u201cbut for\n\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different.\u201d People v. Houston, 229 Ill. 2d 1, 4 (2008). \u201cTo establish prejudice in\n\nthe guilty plea context, \u2018the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPeople v. Valdez, 2016 IL 119860, \u00b6 29 (quoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985)). \u201cA\n\ndefendant must satisfy both prongs of the Strickland test and a failure to satisfy any one of the\n\nprongs precludes a finding of ineffectiveness.\u201d People v. Simpson, 2015 IL 116512, \u00b6 35.\n\nSpeculation as to what an expert witness will say is insufficient to prove the prejudice prong of a\n\nStrickland analysis. People v. Elliot, 2022 IL App (1st) 192294, \u00b6 49.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 14   During closing arguments, defense counsel for the first time attempted to argue that cross-\n\nracial identifications are \u201cdifferent\u201d and that the opportunity for Officer Pratcher to view Mr. Smith\n\nwas short, calling it a \u201cquick encounter.\u201d The State promptly objected, and the objection was\n\nsustained. Based on this exchange, Mr. Smith argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel for arguing an unsupported defense theory. Our caselaw is clear, however,\n\nthat a defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong of the Strickland test for failing to call an expert\n\nwitness based solely on speculation as what a potential witness would have said. Elliot, 2022 IL\n\nApp (1st) 192294, \u00b6 49; People v. Bauer, 393 Ill. App. 3d 414, 424 (2009). Moreover, the officers\u2019\n\nidentification was not the only evidence linking Mr. Smith to the vehicle since the tan Cadillac\n\nthat was stopped was registered to Mr. Smith. While the vehicle ownership alone was not a\n\nsufficient basis for an identification, the vehicle registration, in addition to the interaction with\n\ndefendant, made it unlikely that this was a case of misidentification due to cross-racial\n\nidentification. As a result, we fail to find that Mr. Smith can meet the prejudice prong and find that\n\ncounsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 15   Mr. Smith next argues that the State made improper closing arguments, which admitted\n\nhearsay evidence for an improper purpose and shifted the burden of proof. Mr. Smith did not object\n\nto any of the alleged improper closing arguments, therefore forfeited that argument. People v.\n\nHillier, 237 Ill. 2d 539, 544 (2010). However, we review whether it falls under the plain error\n\nexception to the forfeiture rule.\n\n\u00b6 16   An exception to the forfeiture rule exists in situations where the alleged error rises to the\n\nlevel of plain error. People v. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. Illinois Supreme Court\n\nRule 615(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 1967) provides that \u201csubstantial or what have become known as plain\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nerrors may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.) People v. Sebby, 2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 48. Under the plain error doctrine,\n\na reviewing court may consider forfeited errors if the evidence was closely balanced or \u201cthe error\n\nwas so egregious that [the] defendant was deprived of a substantial right and thus a fair trial.\u201d\n\nRoman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. First, a defendant must prove there was a clear or obvious\n\nerror. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19. The burden of persuasion rests with the defendant,\n\nand the first step is to determine whether any error occurred. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st)\n\n102853, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 17   The State is afforded wide latitude in closing arguments. People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92,\n\n123 (2007). The State may argue to the jury, facts, and reasonable inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence. People v. Terry, 312 Ill. App. 3d 984, 993 (2000). In reviewing remarks made during\n\nclosing arguments, this court asks whether the remarks created a substantial prejudice against the\n\ndefendant such that it is impossible to say whether or not a guilty verdict resulted from the remarks.\n\nWheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92 at 123. Statements must be considered in the context of closing arguments\n\nas a whole, and the State can reasonably respond in rebuttal to the defense\u2019s characterizations of\n\nthe evidence or case. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 225 (2004). If the jury could have reached\n\na contrary verdict had the improper remarks not been made, or if this court cannot say that the\n\nState\u2019s improper remarks did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction, a new trial should be\n\ngranted. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92 at 123.\n\n\u00b6 18   The first remark argued by Mr. Smith was that Mr. Smith\u2019s \u201cactions of choosing to be\n\nuncooperative show that he knows exactly who he is dealing with.\u201d Mr. Smith argues that these\n\nstatements were meaningless unless the State asked the jury to take the hearsay evidence for the\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\ntruth of the matter asserted. We do not share that sentiment.\n\n\u00b6 19   The thrust of Mr. Smith\u2019s trial counsel argument was that Mr. Smith did not know it was\n\nofficers who were trying to initiate contact with Mr. Smith on the date of the incident. However,\n\nthat contention was belied by the trial evidence, which was exemplified in the State\u2019s closing\n\nargument. When Mr. Smith spotted the officers turning in his direction, he drove away and when\n\nthey followed him, he kept driving until he successfully evaded them. Then, according to Officer\n\nRosen, he reclined his seat all the way back, in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid being seen.\n\nWhen Officer Pratcher knocked on Mr. Smith\u2019s window and asked him to lower his window, Mr.\n\nSmith shook his head to indicate a denial of the request. All of those actions, primarily evading\n\nthe officers while driving and reclining his seat, show that he knew he was dealing with police\n\nofficers. The State\u2019s remarks did not ask the jury to consider inadmissible hearsay about the\n\nofficers\u2019 initial interest in Mr. Smith. Rather, following suit of defense counsel, the State argued\n\nthe trial evidence in a persuasive way to fit its narrative of the events. Additionally, both the State\n\nand the trial court admonished the jury, that while the State would make an argument, only the\n\ntrial court could instruct the jury about the law. There was nothing impermissible about the State\u2019s\n\nargument.\n\n\u00b6 20   The next portion of the closing, which Mr. Smith argued was improper, stated:\n\n       \u201cCounsel talks about beyond a reasonable doubt beyond a reasonable doubt. It\u2019s not any\n\n       doubt whatsoever. It\u2019s not a doubt that you can make up. It\u2019s not a doubt that you want to\n\n       make up. I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. It\u2019s a reasonable doubt. Is it reasonable that those\n\n       two officers got together and decided let\u2019s put it on this guy. You saw them right there,\n\n       those two officers. They put this on this guy. Is that reasonable?\u201d\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 21   Mr. Smith cites People v. Wilson, 199 Ill. App. 3d 792 (1990) for the proposition that the\n\nState cannot discuss the credibility of its witnesses when discussing its burden of proof. The case,\n\nhowever, does not stand for that position. In the Wilson case, 199 Ill. App. 3d at 796, the prosecutor\n\nargued that his position involves an obligation and a duty to only prosecute guilty people and\n\ndismiss charges against innocent people. This clearly was a way to bolster the trial evidence based\n\nsolely on his position of public trust rather than the evidence. That is not what the State did here.\n\nHere, the State argued that if the officers\u2019 statements are believed, it has met its burden of proof\n\nbut the only way for it not to meet its burden is to suggest that all of the witnesses were liars or, as\n\nMr. Smith suggested on appeal, mistaken. While the State could have been more precise in its\n\nlanguage and questioned whether it was reasonable that both officers were mistaken in their\n\nidentification of Mr. Smith, that was not an improper argument error which shifted the burden of\n\nproof to Mr. Smith. Since we found that there was no error, in regard to the closing arguments,\n\nthere can be no plain error. People v. Roman, 2013 IL App (1st) 102853, \u00b6 19 (stating the first step\n\nin a plain error analysis is to determine if any error occurred).\n\n\u00b6 22   Mr. Smith\u2019s last argument revolved around his sentencing. He argued that the trial court\n\nerred by sentencing him as a Class X offender based on his prior felonies including a juvenile\n\nconviction which he states could not be used as a predicate for the enhancement. The State\n\nresponded by arguing that the issue is moot since Mr. Smith has completed his sentence including\n\nhis mandatory supervised release (MSR).\n\n\u00b6 23   An issue on appeal becomes moot when events occurring after the appeal render it\n\nimpossible for the reviewing court to grant effective relief. In re Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d 348,\n\n358-59 (2005). Generally, courts of review do not handle moot issues. Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n348 at 359. However, while the completion of a defendant\u2019s sentence renders a challenge to the\n\nsentence moot, a challenge to the conviction is not. Christopher K., 217 Ill. 2d 348 at 359.\n\n\u00b6 24   Here, Mr. Smith challenges only his sentence, which he has completed, and not his\n\nconviction. Mr. Smith correctly argues that the Class X sentence would have future repercussions\n\non his sentence if he is convicted of a crime in the future. As a result, we find the issue is not moot\n\nand review the matter on the merits.\n\n\u00b6 25   In People v. Stewart, 2022 IL 126116, \u00b6 22, our supreme court found that juvenile offenses\n\ndo not qualify as a predicate offense under section 5-4.5-95 of the Uniform Code of Corrections\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-95 (West 2016)), which qualifies a defendant as subject to mandatory Class X\n\nsentencing if he or she has two prior felony convictions. In this case, the trial court found that Mr.\n\nSmith was subject to mandatory Class X sentencing due in part to a 1996 juvenile conviction for\n\na drug offense. Since his juvenile offense could not be considered as a predicate offense, we find\n\nthat the trial court erred in its imposition of his sentence. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith has completed\n\nhis term of imprisonment and mandatory supervised release. Nonetheless, we direct the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus to reflect a Class 2 sentencing for Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for\n\naggravated battery of a peace officer (720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2016)). 720 ILCS 5/12-\n\n3.05(h) (West 2016) (\u201cAggravated battery as defined in subdivision (a)(4), (d)(4), or (g)(3) is a\n\nClass 2 felony\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 26                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 27   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery to a\n\npeace officer and remand the cause to the circuit court of Cook County for the limited purpose of\n\ncorrecting the mittimus.\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 28   Affirmed in part; remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 11 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL App (1st) 192218-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n                                                                             FIFTH DIVISION\n                                                                           JANUARY 19, 2024\n\n                                        No. 1-19-2218\n\nNOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23 and is not precedent except in the\nlimited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                        IN THE\n                             APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n                               FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,            )     Appeal from the\n                                                )     Circuit Court of\n            Plaintiff-Appellee,                 )     Cook County.\n                                                )\n      v.                                        )     No. 16 CR 14596\n                                                )\nALBERT SMITH,                                   )     Honorable\n                                                )     Arthur F.

The circuit court erred by sentencing the defendant as a Class\n             X offender, so the cause is remanded to the circuit court to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b62     On September 27, 2016, the State charged by information the defendant-appellant, Albert\n\nSmith, with three counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated\n\nbattery with a deadly weapon. On August 6, 2019, the circuit court conducted a jury trial of Mr.\n\nSmith on the aforementioned charges. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Mr. Smith\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nguilty of aggravated battery of a peace officer, and he was sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. On\n\nappeal, Mr. Smith argues that: (1) he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel for failing\n\nto provide an expert on cross-racial identification; (2) there was plain error committed during the\n\nState\u2019s closing arguments; and (3) the trial court erred by sentencing him as a Class X offender.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction and remand the cause to the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus.\n\n\u00b63                                        BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On September 27, 2016, the State charged Mr. Smith by information with three counts of\n\naggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nMr. Smith elected to proceed via a jury trial on the charges. On August 6, 2019, the trial court\n\nconducted a jury trial. During the trial, the State called two primary occurrence witnesses: Chicago\n\nPolice Department Officer Terrence Pratcher and Chicago Police Department Officer Anthony\n\nRosen.\n\n\u00b65       Officer Pratcher testified that at the time of the trial, he had been working for the Chicago\n\nPolice Department for approximately 12 years. On May 26, 2016, Officer Pratcher was patrolling\n\nwith Officer Rosen and Officer Rick Caballero in an unmarked Ford Explorer when they were\n\napproached by their confidential informant about a black man selling drugs in a tan Cadillac,\n\nbearing partial license plate number \u201cE30\u201d on the 1600 block of Homan Avenue. At the time, the\n\nofficers were in plainclothes, which was a bulletproof vest with a police star, either on a chain or\n\nembroidered on their bulletproof vests. Though defense counsel objected to the admission of the\n\nstatement of the confidential informant, it was allowed for the limited purpose of the officers\u2019\n\nsubsequent actions. Officer Pratcher and his partners relocated to the area referenced by the\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nconfidential informant but did not see the vehicle. As a result, they drove around the area for about\n\n10 minutes looking for the car. About an hour later, while traveling southbound on Homan Avenue\n\nfrom 16th Street, they saw a parked car matching the description including the partial license plate,\n\n\u201cE30.\u201d When they drove past the vehicle and slowed down to make a U-turn, the black man they\n\nsaw in the driver seat of the vehicle drove away onto 16th Street. The officers followed slowly\n\nbehind the vehicle hoping it would stop but eventually lost sight of the vehicle. Then, they saw the\n\nvehicle parked around 3342 West Odgen and they parked next to the vehicle. All the officers exited\n\nthe vehicle, and Officer Pratcher went to the driver\u2019s side window, where he saw Mr. Smith, whom\n\nhe identified in court. Officer Pratcher knocked on the window and tried to get Mr. Smith to roll\n\ndown his window but Mr. Smith shook his head, \u201cno.\u201d Officer Pratcher then asked Mr. Smith to\n\nstep out of the vehicle and he again declined to do that. Instead, Mr. Smith started the car, shifted\n\nthe car into drive, and then turned the car in the direction of Officer Pratcher. Before Officer\n\nPratcher could move out of the way, the tan Cadillac quickly accelerated and hit him on his right\n\nleg. He ended up on the hood of the vehicle for about 10 feet, while the car traveled westbound on\n\nOgden, before falling off the hood. The other officers tried to run after the vehicle, which kept\n\ngoing, and then they checked on Officer Pratcher. Then, Officer Pratcher and his fellow officers\n\nentered their squad car, called dispatch about the description of the tan Cadillac, and drove around\n\nattempting to locate the Cadillac. Other officers found the car abandoned in a vacant lot.\n\n\u00b66     At the police station, about 30 minutes after Officer Pratcher was struck by the car, Officer\n\nRosen showed him a photograph, which he identified as the man who drove into him, Mr. Smith.\n\nOfficer Pratcher then went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with \u201cbruising and soft tissue\n\ndamage to [his] right leg.\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph was added to the wanted board for Officer\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\nPratcher\u2019s police district. On cross-examination, he conceded that he did not view a photo array or\n\na lineup in this case.\n\n\u00b67      Officer Rosen testified to the same details that Officer Pratcher stated on his direct\n\nexamination, mainly the circumstances leading to the encounter with Mr. Smith, their attire that\n\nday, and also how Officer Pratcher was injured. He added the detail that when they approached\n\nthe parked car, before exiting the vehicle, he observed Mr. Smith was reclined all the way back in\n\nthe driver\u2019s seat of the tan Cadillac. He identified Mr. Smith in court. He looked up the license\n\nplate of the tan Cadillac in the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s database and received Mr. Smith\u2019s name\n\nand information. With that information, he pulled up Mr. Smith\u2019s photograph and confirmed he\n\nwas the driver of the tan Cadillac \u201cwhen it struck Officer Pratcher.\u201d\n\n\u00b68      After the close of the trial evidence, the jury found Mr. Smith guilty of aggravated battery\n\nto a peace officer and not guilty on the count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. On\n\nAugust 27, 2019, the trial court sentenced him to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The court found he was\n\nClass X eligible because of prior felony convictions. Mr. Smith mailed his notice of appeal to the\n\ncircuit court in a letter postmarked September 24, 2019.\n\n\u00b69                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10    We note that we have jurisdiction to consider this matter, as Mr. Smith filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal.

Moreover, the officers\u2019\n\nidentification was not the only evidence linking Mr. Smith to the vehicle since the tan Cadillac\n\nthat was stopped was registered to Mr. Smith. While the vehicle ownership alone was not a\n\nsufficient basis for an identification, the vehicle registration, in addition to the interaction with\n\ndefendant, made it unlikely that this was a case of misidentification due to cross-racial\n\nidentification. As a result, we fail to find that Mr. Smith can meet the prejudice prong and find that\n\ncounsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 15   Mr. Smith next argues that the State made improper closing arguments, which admitted\n\nhearsay evidence for an improper purpose and shifted the burden of proof.

We do not share that sentiment.\n\n\u00b6 19   The thrust of Mr. Smith\u2019s trial counsel argument was that Mr. Smith did not know it was\n\nofficers who were trying to initiate contact with Mr. Smith on the date of the incident. However,\n\nthat contention was belied by the trial evidence, which was exemplified in the State\u2019s closing\n\nargument. When Mr. Smith spotted the officers turning in his direction, he drove away and when\n\nthey followed him, he kept driving until he successfully evaded them. Then, according to Officer\n\nRosen, he reclined his seat all the way back, in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid being seen.\n\nWhen Officer Pratcher knocked on Mr. Smith\u2019s window and asked him to lower his window, Mr.\n\nSmith shook his head to indicate a denial of the request. All of those actions, primarily evading\n\nthe officers while driving and reclining his seat, show that he knew he was dealing with police\n\nofficers. The State\u2019s remarks did not ask the jury to consider inadmissible hearsay about the\n\nofficers\u2019 initial interest in Mr. Smith. Rather, following suit of defense counsel, the State argued\n\nthe trial evidence in a persuasive way to fit its narrative of the events. Additionally, both the State\n\nand the trial court admonished the jury, that while the State would make an argument, only the\n\ntrial court could instruct the jury about the law. There was nothing impermissible about the State\u2019s\n\nargument.\n\n\u00b6 20   The next portion of the closing, which Mr. Smith argued was improper, stated:\n\n       \u201cCounsel talks about beyond a reasonable doubt beyond a reasonable doubt. It\u2019s not any\n\n       doubt whatsoever. It\u2019s not a doubt that you can make up. It\u2019s not a doubt that you want to\n\n       make up. I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. It\u2019s a reasonable doubt. Is it reasonable that those\n\n       two officers got together and decided let\u2019s put it on this guy. You saw them right there,\n\n       those two officers. They put this on this guy. Is that reasonable?\u201d\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 21   Mr. Smith cites People v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039636\"><a href=\"/opinion/2039636/people-v-wilson/\">199 Ill. App. 3d 792</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990) for the proposition that the\n\nState cannot discuss the credibility of its witnesses when discussing its burden of proof. The case,\n\nhowever, does not stand for that position. In the Wilson case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039636\"><a href=\"/opinion/2039636/people-v-wilson/\">199 Ill. App. 3d at 796</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the prosecutor\n\nargued that his position involves an obligation and a duty to only prosecute guilty people and\n\ndismiss charges against innocent people. This clearly was a way to bolster the trial evidence based\n\nsolely on his position of public trust rather than the evidence. That is not what the State did here.\n\nHere, the State argued that if the officers\u2019 statements are believed, it has met its burden of proof\n\nbut the only way for it not to meet its burden is to suggest that all of the witnesses were liars or, as\n\nMr. Smith suggested on appeal, mistaken. While the State could have been more precise in its\n\nlanguage and questioned whether it was reasonable that both officers were mistaken in their\n\nidentification of Mr. Smith, that was not an improper argument error which shifted the burden of\n\nproof to Mr. Smith. Since we found that there was no error, in regard to the closing arguments,\n\nthere can be no plain error. People v. Roman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3148395\"><a href=\"/opinion/3148395/people-v-roman/\">2013 IL App (1st) 102853</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 19 (stating the first step\n\nin a plain error analysis is to determine if any error occurred).\n\n\u00b6 22   Mr. Smith\u2019s last argument revolved around his sentencing. He argued that the trial court\n\nerred by sentencing him as a Class X offender based on his prior felonies including a juvenile\n\nconviction which he states could not be used as a predicate for the enhancement. The State\n\nresponded by arguing that the issue is moot since Mr. Smith has completed his sentence including\n\nhis mandatory supervised release (MSR).\n\n\u00b6 23   An issue on appeal becomes moot when events occurring after the appeal render it\n\nimpossible for the reviewing court to grant effective relief.

However, while the completion of a defendant\u2019s sentence renders a challenge to the\n\nsentence moot, a challenge to the conviction is not. Christopher K., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">217 Ill. 2d 348</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 359.\n\n\u00b6 24   Here, Mr. Smith challenges only his sentence, which he has completed, and not his\n\nconviction. Mr. Smith correctly argues that the Class X sentence would have future repercussions\n\non his sentence if he is convicted of a crime in the future. As a result, we find the issue is not moot\n\nand review the matter on the merits.\n\n\u00b6 25   In People v. Stewart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL 126116</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 22, our supreme court found that juvenile offenses\n\ndo not qualify as a predicate offense under section 5-4.5-95 of the Uniform Code of Corrections\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-95 (West 2016)), which qualifies a defendant as subject to mandatory Class X\n\nsentencing if he or she has two prior felony convictions. In this case, the trial court found that Mr.\n\nSmith was subject to mandatory Class X sentencing due in part to a 1996 juvenile conviction for\n\na drug offense. Since his juvenile offense could not be considered as a predicate offense, we find\n\nthat the trial court erred in its imposition of his sentence. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith has completed\n\nhis term of imprisonment and mandatory supervised release. Nonetheless, we direct the circuit\n\ncourt to correct the mittimus to reflect a Class 2 sentencing for Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for\n\naggravated battery of a peace officer (720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2016)). 720 ILCS 5/12-\n\n3.05(h) (West 2016) (\u201cAggravated battery as defined in subdivision (a)(4), (d)(4), or (g)(3) is a\n\nClass 2 felony\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 26                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 27   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Smith\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery to a\n\npeace officer and remand the cause to the circuit court of Cook County for the limited purpose of\n\ncorrecting the mittimus.\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-19-2218\n\n\n\u00b6 28   Affirmed in part; remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 11 -\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111539/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2018363/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2031898/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2039636/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2042608/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2057711/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2076100/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2076105/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2118950/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2219911/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2783390/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3148395/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4036003/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4240446/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7803478/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9402113/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925474/", "id": 9925474, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467636/hernandez-v-united-states-department-of-justice/", "cluster_id": 9467636, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467636/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T14:01:11.145471-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T14:50:20.734444-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "87ed6d0b617ae517de3286136ec1cd2d2684fd72", "page_count": 6, "download_url": "https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2015cv0944-54", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/hernandez_v._united_states_department_of_justice_1.pdf", "plain_text": "                                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n\n\n    ESPIGMENIO HERNADEZ, JR.,\n\n                             Plaintiff,                        Case No. 15-CV-944 (JMC)\n\n                             v.\n\n    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al.,\n\n                             Defendants.\n\n                                          MEMORANDUM OPINION\n         Plaintiff Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., proceeding pro se, filed suit against the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA)\n\n(collectively, Defendants) seeking records related to his prosecution by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\n\nfor the Western District of Texas.

ECF 13-3 at 10. The Office passed Hernandez\u2019s letter on to the\n\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO/TXW). Id. at 3.\n\n       A paralegal with the USAO/TXW was responsible for locating records potentially\n\nresponsive to Hernandez\u2019s request. In a form attached to a letter sent from the EOUSA to\n\nHernandez, the paralegal indicated that she had located 459 pages of potentially responsive\n\ndocuments: 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of\n\ncorrespondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (DEA). ECF 15 at 18\u201321. She determined that the public records and grand\n\njury transcripts were non-releasable, but she sent the remaining pages of correspondence, attorney\n\nwork product, and DEA documents to the EOUSA. ECF 15 at 21; ECF 19-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20136. By her count,\n\nshe sent 38 pages. ECF 19-1 \u00b6 5. The EOUSA then transferred the 8 pages of DEA documents\n\nback to the DEA, id., leaving 30 pages consisting of correspondence and attorney work-product,\n\nECF 19 at 3\u20134. The EOUSA determined that only 12 of those pages were responsive. Id.\n\n       As to the 12 pages deemed responsive to his request, the EOUSA notified Hernandez that\n\nthe office was fully releasing 4 pages, partially releasing 1 page, and fully withholding 7 pages\n\nbased on FOIA exemptions. ECF 15 at 14\u201315. Hernandez administratively appealed the EOUSA\u2019s\n\ndetermination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). Id. at 24. Citing the USAO/TXW\u2019s\n\nform, Hernandez sought production of the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work\n\nproduct that the USAO/TXW had located. Id. Although OIP received Hernandez\u2019s filing, ECF 13-\n\n3 at 20, the office never notified him of any decision on his timely appeal, ECF 1 \u00b6 16.\n\n       Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, alleging that Defendants violated FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act by failing to produce all records to which he is entitled. ECF 1 \u00b6 11. The Parties\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fthereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF 13; ECF 15. In partially resolving these\n\nmotions, this Court held that the grand jury transcripts were properly withheld, but the Court could\n\nnot determine whether the 18 pages of purportedly nonresponsive correspondence and attorney\n\nwork product were appropriately withheld by the EOUSA. ECF 25 at 13, 15. So, Defendants were\n\nordered to submit those 18 pages for in camera review. Id. at 17. Rather than submit the 18 pages\n\nto the Court for in camera review, however, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and\n\nopted to release the 18 pages to Hernandez. ECF 26 at 1.\n\n       The EOUSA immediately faced a problem when releasing these previously withheld\n\ndocuments. In searching for the key \u201c18 pages,\u201d the EOUSA could find \u201conly 15 pages that were\n\nwithheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\u201d and was \u201cunable to determine why it previously\n\nbelieved that it had withheld 18 pages.\u201d ECF 26 at 1. But \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the EOUSA released\n\nthose 15 pages in full. Id. Hernandez took issue with this supplemental production. He argued that\n\nthe EOUSA provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201c18 pages\u201d initially withheld\n\nand the 15 pages eventually produced, and further protested that these documents \u201cfeatured no\n\ncorrespondence or attorney work product\u201d as the EOUSA claimed. ECF 27 at 2\u20133. To\n\n\u201cinvestigat[e] the alleged discrepancy,\u201d the EOUSA indicated that it would reprocess the\n\nresponsive documents, ECF 28 at 1; ECF 29 at 1, and the Parties moved for summary judgment\n\nshortly thereafter, ECF 35; ECF 38.\n\n       After the EOUSA reprocessed the records, there was still one page unaccounted for.\n\nDefendants assert that when the EOUSA initially requested responsive documents from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, it had received only 37 pages\u2014not 38 pages, as listed on the initial form. ECF 35-\n\n2 at 2. Defendants dismiss this discrepancy as a \u201ctypographical error\u201d or a potentially \u201clost\u201d page.\n\nId. Defendants further represent that, when the EOUSA requested responsive records a second\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftime for the purpose of reprocessing, the USAO/TXW once again transferred 37 pages. ECF 35-1\n\nat 4\u20135. Excepting the 8 pages transferred to the DEA, the entire set of 29 pages were released to\n\nHernandez (16 pages in full, 13 pages in part). ECF 35-1 at 5; ECF 35-2 at 7\u20138. With this\n\nreprocessing and release completed, Defendants assert that they have adequately searched for\n\nrecords responsive to Hernandez\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he is\n\nentitled. ECF 35-1 at 3.\n\n        In his cross motion, Hernandez does not contest the adequacy of the search that the EOUSA\n\nconducted during reprocessing, nor does he dispute the bases for the office\u2019s partial withholding\n\nof 13 pages under FOIA exemptions. He only takes issue with the gap between the number of\n\ndocuments that the EOUSA initially deemed to be unresponsive (18) and the number that the\n\nOffice later released to him (15) before it decided to reprocess the entire batch of documents.\n\nECF 38 at 4\u20136. Hernandez asks this Court to \u201center summary judgment in [his] favor and order\n\nthat the Defendant surrender the original 18-pages or provide a cogent sworn explanation of their\n\nfailure to do so.\u201d Id. at 12.\n\n        The Court had questions about the \u201cclear inconsistency (regarding both number and nature)\n\nbetween the 15 documents that EOUSA produced to Hernandez in response to this Court\u2019s first in\n\ncamera review order and the 18 documents that EOUSA originally deemed non-responsive to\n\nHernandez\u2019s request.\u201d ECF 45 at 4. As such, this Court ordered the EOUSA to submit for in camera\n\nreview (1) the full set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the USAO/TXW when\n\nthe office first referred Hernandez\u2019s request to that jurisdiction; and (2) the full set of documents\n\nthat the EOUSA obtained from the USAO/TXW for reprocessing. Id. at 5. These two sets of\n\ndocuments were submitted, received, and reviewed in camera. The Court now resolves the cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The sole issue at the center of these cross motions is a narrow one. Hernandez only asks\n\nthis Court to determine whether Defendants have \u201csurrend[ered] the original 18-pages or\n\nprovide[d] a cogent sworn explanation of their failure to do so.\u201d ECF 38 at 12. The Court now\n\nconcludes that they have.\n\n       The Court has reviewed the set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, the set of documents that were later reprocessed, and the sworn declaration\n\naccompanying Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion that explains the USAO/TXW\u2019s initial\n\nerror. See ECF 35-2 at 2\u20133. Based on this record, the Court finds that the EOUSA obtained 37\n\npages from the USAO/TXW when it first referred Hernandez\u2019s records request (not 38 pages, as\n\nindicated on the office\u2019s initial form). Those 37 pages received from the USAO/TXW match the\n\n37 pages that were later reprocessed. Excluding the 8 pages transferred to the DEA during both\n\ninitial processing and reprocessing leaves two sets of the same 29 pages. Thus, whatever set of \u201c18\n\npages\u201d the EOUSA deemed nonresponsive during its initial processing of 29 pages must be part\n\nof the second set of 29 pages that were reprocessed because the two sets are identical. And because\n\nthese 29 pages have now been produced to Plaintiff in full or in part, the contested \u201c18 pages\u201d\n\nmust have been surrendered\u2014there are simply no other documents to find, review, or turn over.\n\nTo the extent that, given the partial redactions, some information may have been withheld from\n\nthese documents, Hernandez does not contest the scope of the EOUSA\u2019s search during\n\nreprocessing or its bases for redaction. See generally ECF 38. Thus, with the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nnow indisputably surrendered or cogently accounted for via sworn testimony, see ECF 35-2 at 2,\n\nthe Court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The record establishes that the EOUSA made a mistake. The first set of 37 pages is identical\n\nto the second, which means the EOUSA mischaracterized or miscounted the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nwhen it received the first set of documents from the USAO/TXW. The Court understands\n\nHernandez\u2019s frustration that the EOUSA \u201ccannot explain th[is] discrepancy.\u201d ECF 26-1 at 1. But\n\nthe EOUSA\u2019s error does not change the fact that Hernandez has now received all materials\n\nresponsive to his request, with some documents subject to only partial redactions (which\n\nHernandez does not challenge). The Court is satisfied that Defendants have adequately searched\n\nfor records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he\n\nis entitled.\n\n        Because Defendants have shouldered their burden under FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and DENIES Hernandez\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38.

ECF 13-3 at 10. The Office passed Hernandez\u2019s letter on to the\n\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO/TXW). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 3</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       A paralegal with the USAO/TXW was responsible for locating records potentially\n\nresponsive to Hernandez\u2019s request. In a form attached to a letter sent from the EOUSA to\n\nHernandez, the paralegal indicated that she had located 459 pages of potentially responsive\n\ndocuments: 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of\n\ncorrespondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (DEA). ECF 15 at 18\u201321. She determined that the public records and grand\n\njury transcripts were non-releasable, but she sent the remaining pages of correspondence, attorney\n\nwork product, and DEA documents to the EOUSA. ECF 15 at 21; ECF 19-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20136. By her count,\n\nshe sent 38 pages. ECF 19-1 \u00b6 5. The EOUSA then transferred the 8 pages of DEA documents\n\nback to the DEA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> leaving 30 pages consisting of correspondence and attorney work-product,\n\nECF 19 at 3\u20134. The EOUSA determined that only 12 of those pages were responsive. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       As to the 12 pages deemed responsive to his request, the EOUSA notified Hernandez that\n\nthe office was fully releasing 4 pages, partially releasing 1 page, and fully withholding 7 pages\n\nbased on FOIA exemptions. ECF 15 at 14\u201315. Hernandez administratively appealed the EOUSA\u2019s\n\ndetermination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 24</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Citing the USAO/TXW\u2019s\n\nform, Hernandez sought production of the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work\n\nproduct that the USAO/TXW had located. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Although OIP received Hernandez\u2019s filing, ECF 13-\n\n3 at 20, the office never notified him of any decision on his timely appeal, ECF 1 \u00b6 16.\n\n       Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, alleging that Defendants violated FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act by failing to produce all records to which he is entitled. ECF 1 \u00b6 11. The Parties\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fthereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF 13; ECF 15. In partially resolving these\n\nmotions, this Court held that the grand jury transcripts were properly withheld, but the Court could\n\nnot determine whether the 18 pages of purportedly nonresponsive correspondence and attorney\n\nwork product were appropriately withheld by the EOUSA. ECF 25 at 13, 15. So, Defendants were\n\nordered to submit those 18 pages for in camera review. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 17</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rather than submit the 18 pages\n\nto the Court for in camera review, however, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and\n\nopted to release the 18 pages to Hernandez. ECF 26 at 1.\n\n       The EOUSA immediately faced a problem when releasing these previously withheld\n\ndocuments. In searching for the key \u201c18 pages,\u201d the EOUSA could find \u201conly 15 pages that were\n\nwithheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\u201d and was \u201cunable to determine why it previously\n\nbelieved that it had withheld 18 pages.\u201d ECF 26 at 1. But \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the EOUSA released\n\nthose 15 pages in full. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Hernandez took issue with this supplemental production. He argued that\n\nthe EOUSA provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201c18 pages\u201d initially withheld\n\nand the 15 pages eventually produced, and further protested that these documents \u201cfeatured no\n\ncorrespondence or attorney work product\u201d as the EOUSA claimed. ECF 27 at 2\u20133. To\n\n\u201cinvestigat[e] the alleged discrepancy,\u201d the EOUSA indicated that it would reprocess the\n\nresponsive documents, ECF 28 at 1; ECF 29 at 1, and the Parties moved for summary judgment\n\nshortly thereafter, ECF 35; ECF 38.\n\n       After the EOUSA reprocessed the records, there was still one page unaccounted for.\n\nDefendants assert that when the EOUSA initially requested responsive documents from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, it had received only 37 pages\u2014not 38 pages, as listed on the initial form. ECF 35-\n\n2 at 2. Defendants dismiss this discrepancy as a \u201ctypographical error\u201d or a potentially \u201clost\u201d page.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Defendants further represent that, when the EOUSA requested responsive records a second\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftime for the purpose of reprocessing, the USAO/TXW once again transferred 37 pages. ECF 35-1\n\nat 4\u20135. Excepting the 8 pages transferred to the DEA, the entire set of 29 pages were released to\n\nHernandez (16 pages in full, 13 pages in part). ECF 35-1 at 5; ECF 35-2 at 7\u20138. With this\n\nreprocessing and release completed, Defendants assert that they have adequately searched for\n\nrecords responsive to Hernandez\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he is\n\nentitled. ECF 35-1 at 3.\n\n        In his cross motion, Hernandez does not contest the adequacy of the search that the EOUSA\n\nconducted during reprocessing, nor does he dispute the bases for the office\u2019s partial withholding\n\nof 13 pages under FOIA exemptions. He only takes issue with the gap between the number of\n\ndocuments that the EOUSA initially deemed to be unresponsive (18) and the number that the\n\nOffice later released to him (15) before it decided to reprocess the entire batch of documents.\n\nECF 38 at 4\u20136. Hernandez asks this Court to \u201center summary judgment in [his] favor and order\n\nthat the Defendant surrender the original 18-pages or provide a cogent sworn explanation of their\n\nfailure to do so.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 12</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n        The Court had questions about the \u201cclear inconsistency (regarding both number and nature)\n\nbetween the 15 documents that EOUSA produced to Hernandez in response to this Court\u2019s first in\n\ncamera review order and the 18 documents that EOUSA originally deemed non-responsive to\n\nHernandez\u2019s request.\u201d ECF 45 at 4. As such, this Court ordered the EOUSA to submit for in camera\n\nreview (1) the full set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the USAO/TXW when\n\nthe office first referred Hernandez\u2019s request to that jurisdiction; and (2) the full set of documents\n\nthat the EOUSA obtained from the USAO/TXW for reprocessing. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 5</span><pre class=\"inline\">. These two sets of\n\ndocuments were submitted, received, and reviewed in camera. The Court now resolves the cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The sole issue at the center of these cross motions is a narrow one. Hernandez only asks\n\nthis Court to determine whether Defendants have \u201csurrend[ered] the original 18-pages or\n\nprovide[d] a cogent sworn explanation of their failure to do so.\u201d ECF 38 at 12. The Court now\n\nconcludes that they have.\n\n       The Court has reviewed the set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, the set of documents that were later reprocessed, and the sworn declaration\n\naccompanying Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion that explains the USAO/TXW\u2019s initial\n\nerror. See ECF 35-2 at 2\u20133. Based on this record, the Court finds that the EOUSA obtained 37\n\npages from the USAO/TXW when it first referred Hernandez\u2019s records request (not 38 pages, as\n\nindicated on the office\u2019s initial form). Those 37 pages received from the USAO/TXW match the\n\n37 pages that were later reprocessed. Excluding the 8 pages transferred to the DEA during both\n\ninitial processing and reprocessing leaves two sets of the same 29 pages. Thus, whatever set of \u201c18\n\npages\u201d the EOUSA deemed nonresponsive during its initial processing of 29 pages must be part\n\nof the second set of 29 pages that were reprocessed because the two sets are identical. And because\n\nthese 29 pages have now been produced to Plaintiff in full or in part, the contested \u201c18 pages\u201d\n\nmust have been surrendered\u2014there are simply no other documents to find, review, or turn over.\n\nTo the extent that, given the partial redactions, some information may have been withheld from\n\nthese documents, Hernandez does not contest the scope of the EOUSA\u2019s search during\n\nreprocessing or its bases for redaction. See generally ECF 38. Thus, with the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nnow indisputably surrendered or cogently accounted for via sworn testimony, see ECF 35-2 at 2,\n\nthe Court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The record establishes that the EOUSA made a mistake. The first set of 37 pages is identical\n\nto the second, which means the EOUSA mischaracterized or miscounted the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nwhen it received the first set of documents from the USAO/TXW. The Court understands\n\nHernandez\u2019s frustration that the EOUSA \u201ccannot explain th[is] discrepancy.\u201d ECF 26-1 at 1. But\n\nthe EOUSA\u2019s error does not change the fact that Hernandez has now received all materials\n\nresponsive to his request, with some documents subject to only partial redactions (which\n\nHernandez does not challenge). The Court is satisfied that Defendants have adequately searched\n\nfor records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he\n\nis entitled.\n\n        Because Defendants have shouldered their burden under FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and DENIES Hernandez\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38.

The suit seeks to recover under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw for the allegedly negligent care that Rodr\u00edguez received at\n\nHSC during and following an abdominal surgery performed by Dr.\n\nIris V\u00e9lez Garc\u00eda (\"Dr. V\u00e9lez\") and Dr. Zacar\u00edas A. Mateo Minaya\n\n(\"Dr. Mateo\").     We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n                                        A.\n\n           We begin with a recitation of the undisputed facts and\n\nrelevant procedural history.1\n\n           On February 29, 2016, Rodr\u00edguez visited HSC complaining\n\nof pelvic pain.        Rodr\u00edguez -- who was then seventy-one years old\n\nand   living    with    several   chronic      health   conditions    including\n\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, and asthma -- was examined by Dr.\n\n\n\n\n1    Unless otherwise specified, all quotations in this section\nare drawn from reports prepared by the parties' proffered expert\nwitnesses summarizing the medical records from Rodr\u00edguez's visits\nto HSC.\n                                    - 1 -\n\fV\u00e9lez, who had been her regular gynecologist since 2005. Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nrecommended that Rodr\u00edguez undergo a bilateral oophorectomy via\n\nlaparotomy after a pelvic ultrasound revealed a \"complex cystic\n\nmass\" near Rodr\u00edguez's right ovary.\n\n            Dr. V\u00e9lez performed Rodr\u00edguez's surgery on April 21,\n\n2016, at HSC.        During the surgery, Dr. V\u00e9lez discovered that\n\nRodr\u00edguez had a \"frozen pelvis\" with multiple \"intraabdominal\n\nadhesions,\" and so she requested a surgical consultation from Dr.\n\nMateo, another gynecologist on HSC's staff.                   Dr. Mateo assisted\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez with Rodr\u00edguez's surgery.               On April 25, 2016, Rodr\u00edguez\n\nwas discharged from HSC after HSC staff observed \"positive bowel\n\nsounds\" and Rodr\u00edguez reported \"positive stool passage.\"\n\n            Four   days     later,    on    April      29,   during    a    scheduled\n\npostoperative      appointment       with   Dr.     V\u00e9lez    at   HSC,      Rodr\u00edguez\n\nreported that she had been experiencing \"nausea, vomiting, and\n\nabdominal/pelvic pain since April 26.\" Rodr\u00edguez was then admitted\n\nto HSC's emergency department and was diagnosed with a presumed\n\nperforated sigmoid colon.        Later that day, Rodr\u00edguez underwent an\n\nemergency    exploratory       laparotomy         to    address       her    presumed\n\nperforated colon, during which Dr. V\u00e9lez, Dr. Mateo, and one Dr.\n\nOrtiz Rosado2 performed a \"partial colectomy with Hartman[n] pouch,\n\nend   colostomy[,]    and    subtotal       hysterectomy.\"         Rodr\u00edguez      was\n\n\n\n2     Dr. Ortiz Rosado is not a party to this suit.\n                                       - 2 -\n\fsubsequently admitted to HSC's intensive care unit (\"ICU\") in\n\ncritical condition.      She was intubated on a respirator with a\n\nnasogastric (\"NG\") tube, a colostomy bag, and a Foley catheter.\n\n           In   HSC's   ICU,   Rodr\u00edguez    received   care   from    various\n\nspecialists, including Dr. V\u00e9lez and staff from HSC's \"general\n\nsurgery,   internal     medicine,    infectious   disease,     cardiology,\n\npulmonology,      nephrology,       hematology/oncology,       and       ENT\"\n\ndepartments.    Two days after her admission to the ICU, on May 1,\n\nRodr\u00edguez was diagnosed with \"bacteremia/sepsis.\"         Then, on May 4,\n\nRodr\u00edguez tested positive for pseudomonas bacteria, at which point\n\nHSC's \"infection control program became involved\" with her care.\n\nHSC's   epidemiology     department     recommended     several      specific\n\ndisinfection protocols to treat Rodr\u00edguez's pseudomonas infection,\n\nbut \"[t]here is no documentation that these recommendations were\n\ncarried out at any time.\"\n\n           On May 6, HSC staff discovered that Rodr\u00edguez's stoma\n\nhad become necrotic.       Rodr\u00edguez consequently underwent a third\n\nsurgical procedure consisting of \"an exploratory laparotomy, ileal\n\nresection, transverse colon loop colostomy, enterography, and\n\nenteroclysis.\" Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Ortiz Rosado performed this third\n\nsurgery.    Rodr\u00edguez was then returned to the ICU, where she\n\ncontinued to receive care from HSC staff.\n\n           On May 12, nursing and infectious-disease staff noted\n\n\"the presence of worms and/or maggots in the right nostril of\n                                    - 3 -\n\f[Rodr\u00edguez], where the NG tube was located.\"         A CT scan of\n\nRodr\u00edguez's sinuses was ordered, but there was otherwise \"little\n\nto no documentation of [any] consultations regarding the presence\n\nof worms nor any analysis of the source of these worms.\"\n\n          On May 15, it was \"documented that [Rodr\u00edguez's] fecal\n\ncollector [was] out of place.\"    The following day, HSC staff noted\n\nthat the fecal collector \"continue[d] to be displaced and that\n\nthere [was] abundant fecal material around the site [of the fecal\n\ncollector] as well as coming from\" an \"open wound\" near the site.\n\n          On May 18, two types of bacteria were detected in\n\ncultures of fluid taken from Rodr\u00edguez's abdomen.    That same day,\n\nHSC staff noted that Rodr\u00edguez was \"no longer responding to verbal\n\nor physical stimuli.\"      By the following afternoon, HSC staff\n\ndetermined that Rodr\u00edguez could not undergo a planned fourth\n\nprocedure \"due to worsening of her condition,\" and they obtained\n\na \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order from Rodr\u00edguez's family.      Rodr\u00edguez\n\ndied later that evening, at 8:48 P.M. on May 19, 2016.\n\n          An autopsy determined that Rodr\u00edguez's cause of death\n\nwas \"peritonitis due to sigmoid colon perforation with associated\n\nsepsis and septic shock.     Complicating factors were congestive\n\nheart   failure,    bilateral    bronchopneumonia,   and    diabetic\n\nketoacidosis.\"   The autopsy also showed \"multiple pressure ulcers\"\n\non Rodr\u00edguez's body.\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f                                      B.\n\n            The plaintiffs filed suit in the District Court on May\n\n11, 2018.     The operative complaint named as defendants Quality\n\nHealth Services of Puerto Rico, Inc., doing business as HSC\n\n(\"Quality Health/HSC\"); Dr. V\u00e9lez; Dr. Mateo; Dr. Mateo's wife,\n\nBerris Castillo; the Mateo-Castillo         conjugal partnership; and\n\nseveral   other   individuals   and    corporations   \"whose   identities\n\n[were] unknown, [but who] by their negligent acts or omissions\n\ncaused or contributed to the damages claimed.\"3\n\n            The operative complaint asserted that \"[HSC] and [its]\n\npersonnel, including [Dr. V\u00e9lez] and [Dr. Mateo], were practicing\n\nbelow the standard of care in the treatment\" that they provided to\n\nRodr\u00edguez, and that Rodr\u00edguez's \"premature death . . . was caused\n\nby the negligent management of her condition.\"            The complaint\n\nalleged several departures from \"medical standards\" and instances\n\nof \"professional negligence\" in the defendants' care of Rodr\u00edguez\n\nwhich \"include[d], but [were] not limited to\":\n\n            failure to recognize, appropriately asses[s]\n            and repair damage to any organs involved in or\n            near the operative field prior to closing the\n            abdomen; failure to recognize that Mrs.\n            Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s sigmoid colon was damaged in this\n            circumstance and to perform an appropriate\n            repair procedure to assure sigmoid colon\n            integrity before abdominal closure; failure in\n            the proper management of hygiene by the\n\n3    The plaintiffs also named as a defendant,                 but   later\nvoluntarily dismissed, Fundaci\u00f3n San Cristobal, Inc.\n                                 - 5 -\n\f          hospital staff in the care of Mrs. Rodr\u00edguez;\n          failure in the documentation of the findings;\n          failure to manage the infectious processes\n          suffered by the patient; failure to manage the\n          patient's pre-existing condition of diabetes\n          which likely exacerbated her condition and\n          accelerated her demise; failure to timely\n          correct   the   displacement   of  the   fecal\n          collector[;] and failure to manage the\n          patient's care by presenting multiple pressure\n          ulcers at autopsy due to the fact that\n          apparently the staff did not make changes in\n          the patient's position in the required time.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that these alleged deficiencies in the care\n\nprovided to Rodr\u00edguez made the defendants liable for negligence\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.   See P.R. Laws tit. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 5141, 5142.   The\n\nplaintiffs sought $3 million in damages for pain and suffering.\n\n                                C.\n\n          To establish a prima facie case of negligence under\n\nPuerto Rico law, \"a plaintiff must establish (1) the duty owed\n\n(i.e., the minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill\n\nrequired in the relevant circumstances), (2) an act or omission\n\ntransgressing that duty, and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between\n\nthe breach and the claimed harm.\u201d    Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry v. Corporaci\u00f3n\n\nInsular de Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 189 (1st Cir. 1997).     In cases\n\nof alleged medical malpractice, \"Puerto Rico holds health care\n\nprofessionals to a national standard of care.\"    Id. at 190.\n\n          Under Puerto Rico law, \"physicians are protected by a\n\npresumption to the effect that they have exercised a reasonable\n\ndegree of care and the treatment provided was adequate.\"        L\u00f3pez\n                               - 6 -\n\fDelgado   v.    Ca\u00f1izares,   163   P.R.    Dec.   119   (2004)    (certified\n\ntranslation at Appellant's App. 247).             Thus, \"[a] physician's\n\nnegligence is not presumed from the fact that a patient suffered\n\ndamages or the treatment was unsuccessful.\"             Id.      Instead, to\n\nestablish \"a breach of a physician's duty of care,\" a plaintiff\n\n\"ordinarily must adduce expert testimony to limn the minimum\n\nacceptable standard and confirm the defendant doctor's failure to\n\nmeet it.\"    Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 190.\n\n            In preparation for trial, the District Court ordered the\n\nparties to submit a joint pretrial conference memorandum outlining\n\nthe contours of the case and the evidence that they would present\n\nat trial.      The plaintiffs indicated in the memorandum that they\n\nwould rely on the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Jason S.\n\nJames (\"Dr. James\"), to establish the defendants' negligence.            The\n\nplaintiffs asserted that Dr. James would\n\n            testify as a medical expert in obstetrics,\n            gynecology[,] and general medicine about his\n            professional qualifications, his review of the\n            medical records in this case, the applicable\n            medical standards, his expert report and\n            deposition   testimony,    the   reports    of\n            defendants' experts, his professional opinion\n            as to the departures from the medical\n            standards by defendants in the treatment\n            provided to [Rodr\u00edguez] and their causal\n            relationship with [Rodr\u00edguez's] injuries and\n            premature death[,] and about any applicable\n            medical literature in support of his opinion.\n\nThe plaintiffs also \"reserve[d] the right to use as their own any\n\nexpert witness announced by the defendants.\"\n                                   - 7 -\n\f               Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo represented that they would each\n\ncall an      expert witness       of their own, and      Quality Health/HSC\n\nrepresented that it would call its own expert witness as well.\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez represented that her expert, Dr. Adri\u00e1n Col\u00f3n Laracuente,\n\nwould testify as to Dr. V\u00e9lez's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez \"from the\n\ngynecological and surgical standpoint . . . and her compliance\n\nwith the standard of care.\" Dr. Mateo represented that his expert,\n\ngynecological specialist Dr. Alfredo S. Col\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez, would\n\ntestify \"regarding his opinion that Dr. Mateo complied with all\n\nthe applicable medical standards while providing assistance during\n\nthe    two   surgical   interventions      to   [Rodr\u00edguez]     in   which   his\n\nassistance was requested.\"           Quality Health/HSC represented that\n\nits expert, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez, would testify\n\nas    to   \"the   standard   of    care   applicable    to   this    case,   the\n\ncorrectness of the treatment given to\" Rodr\u00edguez by HSC staff,\n\n\"and    that    such   treatment    did   not   cause   [the]   plaintiff[s']\n\ndamages.\"\n\n               Following a pretrial conference, the District Court\n\nreferred the case to a magistrate judge for mediation.               Mediation\n\nwas unsuccessful, in part because the defendants represented at\n\nthe settlement conference that they intended to file motions in\n\nlimine, the resolution of which had the potential to affect the\n\nparties' settlement efforts.\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\f          Two separate motions in limine were filed -- one by\n\nQuality Health/HSC and the other by Dr. Mateo, Berris Castillo,\n\nand the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership, joined by Dr. V\u00e9lez.\n\nThe motions sought to exclude the expert opinion testimony of the\n\nplaintiffs' expert, Dr. James.          Both motions argued that Dr.\n\nJames's testimony must be excluded because his expert report did\n\nnot comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) and because,\n\neven if the report did, the plaintiffs had not met their burden\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to show that his testimony was\n\nadmissible.\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 requires parties in\n\ncivil cases to disclose their witnesses. Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires\n\nthat the disclosure of any witness \"retained or specially employed\n\nto provide expert testimony\" include a written report prepared and\n\nsigned by the expert witness which \"must contain,\" among other\n\nrequirements, \"a complete statement of all opinions the witness\n\nwill express and the basis and reasons for them.\"         Rule 26(e)(2)\n\nthen requires that the proponent of an expert witness \"supplement\"\n\ntheir   initial   disclosure   to    alert   opposing   parties   to   any\n\nsubsequent \"additions or changes\" to the content of the expert's\n\ntestimony.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1), meanwhile,\n\nprovides that \"[i]f a party fails to provide information                or\n\nidentify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is\n\nnot allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence\n                                    - 9 -\n\fon a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was\n\nsubstantially justified or is harmless.\"\n\n            Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility\n\nof expert opinion testimony.             It provides that a qualified expert\n\nwitness \"may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" only\n\nif   the   party    seeking      to   introduce      the    witness's     testimony\n\ndemonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) the\n\nwitness's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n\nwill help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n\ndetermine   a     fact    in   issue\";    (b)    \"the   testimony    is   based   on\n\nsufficient facts or data\"; (c) \"the testimony is the product of\n\nreliable principles and methods\"; and (d) \"the expert's opinion\n\nreflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to\n\nthe facts of the case.\"          Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n            Dr.     James's      expert     report      first     summarized      his\n\nqualifications       as    a    licensed        physician    and    gynecological\n\nspecialist \"well versed in the current standards of care applicable\n\nto the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.\"                  Dr. James's report\n\nstated that, \"[i]n this matter, [his] opinions [were] based on\n\n[certain enumerated] medical records and documents . . . and on\n\nreliable and accepted scientific principles to a reasonable degree\n\nof medical certainty.\"          The report next stated that Dr. James had\n\nreviewed the hospital records associated with Rodr\u00edguez's stays at\n\nHSC between April 21 and April 25, 2016, and between April 29 and\n                                      - 10 -\n\fMay 19, 2016, as well as Dr. V\u00e9lez's office records pertaining to\n\nher care of Rodr\u00edguez since 2005.       The report then recited the\n\nfacts of Rodr\u00edguez's case and closed with Dr. James's \"Comment\" on\n\nthe case.    In that \"Comment\" section, Dr. James wrote:\n\n            Based on the medical documents submitted, it\n            appears that [Rodr\u00edguez] expired from sepsis\n            and septic shock, a condition caused by the\n            perforated sigmoid colon that occurred in the\n            initial surgery on April 21, 2016 performed by\n            Dr. [V\u00e9lez] and Dr. [Mateo].      This patient\n            encountered several organisms throughout her\n            various organ systems: Klebsiella pneumonia,\n            Pseudomonas   aeruginosa,   and   Enterococcus\n            faecalis in the blood, in the inguinal and\n            perianal secretions, in the urine, in the\n            colostomy, and in the throat, as noted in the\n            autopsy report.       In addition, the most\n            surprising finding was the worms and/or\n            maggots that were noted to be present in the\n            nostril of the patient where the NG tube was\n            placed.    There is little room for doubt\n            regarding the inappropriate nature and poor\n            hygiene which was utilized by the hospital\n            personnel in caring for [Rodr\u00edguez]. There is\n            poor documentation regarding this unusual\n            discovery and no evidence that appropriate\n            precautions were taken to prevent this\n            occurrence or to remedy the situation once it\n            was realized.      There is no evidence of\n            appropriate disinfection of the hospital room,\n            equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n            herself as recommended by infectious disease\n            and epidemiology. In addition, there appears\n            to be poor management of [Rodr\u00edguez's] medical\n            comorbidities, such as inadequate care for her\n            diabetes   which    likely   exacerbated   her\n            condition and accelerated her demise.       It\n            appears that her fecal collector remained out\n            of place for more than 24 hours after\n            discovering it had become dislodged, allowing\n            fecal material to contaminate the stoma as\n            well as the open wound itself. Further, there\n            is evidence on autopsy of multiple pressure\n                               - 11 -\n\f           ulcers, which lends further evidence of the\n           substandard care that [Rodr\u00edguez] received\n           during her admission at [HSC].\n\n           In conclusion, it is my opinion -- based upon\n           a     reasonable     degree     of     medical\n           certainty -- that in the case discussed above\n           there were numerous deviations, failures, and\n           departures from acceptable standards of care\n           on the part of Dr. [V\u00e9lez], Dr. Mateo, as well\n           as on the part of [HSC] and its staff.\n\n           In their motions to exclude Dr. James's expert testimony\n\nunder Rule 26, the defendants argued that Dr. James's expert report\n\n\"fail[ed] to state the totality of his opinions in this case . . .\n\nconsidering the scope of the testimony stated in the Pretrial\n\nReport and which [the p]laintiffs apparently intend[ed] to present\n\nat trial.\" The defendants further contended that the report \"[did]\n\nnot state the applicable standards of care; [did] not specify\n\nwhether the standards of care are applicable on a national basis;\n\n[did] not state how the applicable standards were specifically\n\nbreached\"; did not explain how the defendants' \"alleged negligence\n\ncaused and/or contributed to [Rodr\u00edguez's] condition and demise\";\n\nand was \"conspicuously lacking in reference or citations to medical\n\nliterature.\"      Accordingly, the defendants argued that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony had to be excluded under Rule 37(c).\n\n           Alternatively, the defendants argued that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony should be \"excluded as speculative\" under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 702.      They contended that was so because Dr. James's\n\nexpert   report    did   not   articulate   either   a   \"[s]cientifically\n                                   - 12 -\n\facceptable    methodology\"         or   \"the     bases      and   foundations    that\n\nunderlie [his] expert opinion\" and because nothing else in the\n\nrecord enabled the plaintiffs to meet their burden to show that\n\nhis testimony was admissible under Rule 702.\n\n             The   plaintiffs      opposed       the    defendants'       motions   to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony.             The plaintiffs did not request,\n\nhowever, that the District Court hold a hearing on the merits of\n\nthe motions at which Dr. James could testify.                   Nor did they request\n\nleave to supplement Dr. James's expert report.                           Instead, the\n\nplaintiffs    argued   that     the     entirety       of   Dr.    James's   proposed\n\ntestimony was admissible based on the expert report itself.\n\n             The District Court granted the defendants' motions to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony.            In so ruling, the District Court\n\nrelied entirely on Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\n\n             As to Dr. V\u00e9lez's and Dr. Mateo's motion under Rule 702\n\nto exclude Dr. James's testimony, the District Court reasoned that\n\nDr. James's expert report \"conclude[d] as a matter of fact that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated' [Rodr\u00edguez's] sigmoid colon\n\nduring the first surgery on April 21, 2016\" but provided \"no\n\nexplanation\" for that conclusion, instead \"seemingly assum[ing]\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo did so because [Rodr\u00edguez] returned\n\nto   [HSC]   complaining      of    pelvic     pain      some     days   after   being\n\ndischarged\" and was found to have had a perforated sigmoid colon\n\nat that time.      The District Court held that that assumption was\n                                        - 13 -\n\f\"not enough for a finding that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated\n\nthe colon.\"     The District Court further observed that although Dr.\n\nJames \"conclude[d that] Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from\n\nacceptable standards of care,\" his report did not \"state what those\n\nstandards are, nor where they come from[, nor] how Dr. V\u00e9lez and\n\nDr. Mateo deviated from them.\"\n\n            As to Quality Health/HSC's motion under Rule 702 to\n\nexclude Dr. James's testimony, the District Court concluded that\n\nDr. James's opinions regarding the alleged negligence of HSC staff\n\n\"fare[d]   no   better\"   than    his   opinions    regarding     the   alleged\n\nnegligence of Drs. Mateo and V\u00e9lez.         And that was so, the District\n\nCourt explained, even though the report pointed to several alleged\n\ndepartures from acceptable standards of care, because \"nowhere in\n\n[his] report [did] Dr. James identify the standard of care that\n\n[HSC's] hospital staff should have adhered to; where that standard\n\ncomes from; and how the staff deviated from that standard.\"\n\n            At the same time that the District Court granted the\n\ndefendants' motions to exclude Dr. James's testimony under Rule\n\n702, the District Court also granted the defendants' requested\n\nleave to move for summary judgment within ten days.                Dr. Mateo,\n\nBerris Castillo, and the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership moved\n\nfor summary judgment seven days later, which motion Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\njoined;    Quality   Health/HSC    filed    its    own   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment two days later.\n                                   - 14 -\n\f            The    plaintiffs       opposed       both    motions    for     summary\n\njudgment, arguing that even if Dr. James's testimony were excluded,\n\nthey   could     rely   on    the   testimony      of    the   defendants'    expert\n\nwitnesses to prove their case.            In the alternative, the plaintiffs\n\nasked the District Court to reconsider its ruling excluding Dr.\n\nJames's expert testimony, as they contended that the defendants\n\nwere not entitled to summary judgment if Dr. James's testimony\n\nwere not excluded.\n\n            The District Court denied the plaintiffs' request for\n\nreconsideration,        granted     the   defendants'      motions   for     summary\n\njudgment, dismissed the plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, and\n\nentered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs timely\n\nappealed the District Court's entry of summary judgment.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            We    first      address   the      plaintiffs'     challenge    to   the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr.\n\nMateo.   \"'To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving\n\nparty must demonstrate the existence of a trialworthy issue as to\n\nsome material fact,' i.e., a fact that 'potentially could affect\n\nthe suit's outcome.'\"          L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez v. Toledo-Gonz\u00e1lez, 32 F.4th\n\n87, 97 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 187).\n\nTo make this showing, a plaintiff \"must affirmatively point to\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic\n\ndispute.\"      Feliciano-Mu\u00f1oz v. Rebarber-Ocasio, 970 F.3d 53, 62\n                                       - 15 -\n\f(1st Cir. 2020) (quoting McCarthy v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d\n\n313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995)).          Our review of the summary judgment\n\nruling here is de novo.        See Milward v. Rust-Oleum Corp. (Milward\n\nII), 820 F.3d 469, 472-73 (1st Cir. 2016).\n\n           The District Court based its ruling that Drs. Mateo and\n\nV\u00e9lez were entitled to summary judgment in part on its decision to\n\nexclude   Dr.   James's   expert     testimony   under    Rule   702.    The\n\nplaintiffs now contend that this Rule 702 ruling was in error.\n\nThe   plaintiffs   do   not    suggest   in   advancing   that   contention,\n\nhowever, that they can meet their burden to show that Dr. James's\n\ntestimony is admissible under Rule 702 based on anything extrinsic\n\nto his expert report.4        The plaintiffs simply contend based on the\n\nreport itself that the District Court abused its discretion in\n\nruling that the plaintiffs had failed to meet that burden.5              The\n\nplaintiffs then go on to contend, in the alternative, that we must\n\n\n\n4    The plaintiffs assert as part of their challenge to the\nDistrict Court's Rule 702 ruling that the District Court's decision\nto exclude Dr. James's report altogether after finding it deficient\nwas \"too extreme of a sanction\" -- but they conceded at oral\nargument that they never requested leave to amend Dr. James's\nexpert report to cure its alleged deficiencies, and they point to\nno authority suggesting that the District Court should have sua\nsponte granted them leave to do so before excluding the testimony.\n5    Although the plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred\nby not holding a Daubert hearing on the admissibility of Dr.\nJames's testimony before granting the defendants' motions in\nlimine to exclude it, the contention fails for the same reasons we\nrejected a similar contention in Gonz\u00e1lez-Arroyo v. Doctors'\nCenter Hospital Bayam\u00f3n, Inc., 54 F.4th 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2022).\n                                    - 16 -\n\foverturn the summary judgment ruling even if the District Court's\n\nRule 702 determination was not error.          And that is so, they\n\ncontend, because of evidence in the record that is independent of\n\nDr. James's testimony.        For the reasons set forth below, we\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs' grounds for challenging the summary\n\njudgment ruling have no merit.\n\n                                   A.\n\n          To   assess   the   plaintiffs'   challenge   to   the   summary\n\njudgment ruling at issue, it helps to focus first on the aspect of\n\nthat challenge that concerns the District Court's ruling excluding\n\nDr. James's testimony under Rule 702.          To do so, we begin by\n\nreviewing the requirements that Rule 702 sets forth before then\n\nturning back to the District Court's Rule 702 ruling.          With that\n\nfoundation in place, we then will be well-positioned to explain\n\nwhy the plaintiffs' challenge to the grant of summary judgment to\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo fails.\n\n                                   1.\n\n          Rule 702 provides in full that:\n\n          A witness who is qualified as an expert by\n          knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n          education may testify in the form of an\n          opinion   or  otherwise if   the  proponent\n          demonstrates to the court that it is more\n          likely than not that:\n\n          (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or\n          other specialized knowledge will help the\n          trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n          determine a fact in issue;\n                                 - 17 -\n\f          (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts\n          or data;\n\n          (c) the testimony is the product of reliable\n          principles and methods; and\n\n          (d) the expert\u2019s opinion reflects a reliable\n          application of the principles and methods to\n          the facts of the case.6\n\n          Rule   702,   in   its     present    form,   incorporates   the\n\nreasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).          See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 702 advisory committee's notes to 2000 amendment.         There,\n\nthe Court construed an earlier version of the rule and explained\n\nthat it assigns a \"gatekeeping role for the judge\" to determine\n\nwhether \"an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation\n\nand is relevant to the task at hand.\"          Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597.\n\n          As a result, the present version of Rule 702 \"affirms\n\nthe trial court's role as gatekeeper and provides some general\n\nstandards that the trial court must use to assess the reliability\n\nand helpfulness of proffered expert testimony.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 702\n\nadvisory committee's notes to 2000 amendment.           To that end, the\n\npresent version of the rule establishes that expert testimony may\n\n\n\n\n6    This is the current version of Rule 702, which went into\neffect on December 1, 2023.     See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory\ncommittee's notes to 2023 amendment. However, the application of\nthe rule to this case is not affected by the 2023 changes. See\nFed. R. Evid. 702 (2011) (amended 2023).\n                                   - 18 -\n\fbe admitted into evidence only if it is \"based on sufficient facts\n\nor data,\" is \"the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and\n\n\"reflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to\n\nthe facts of the case.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n            Moreover, in applying Rule 702, we continue to draw on\n\nDaubert's reasoning. See, e.g., Milward v. Acuity Specialty Prods.\n\nGrp., Inc., (Milward I), 639 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2011).                   Thus,\n\n\"[t]he focus\" of the inquiry into the admissibility of expert\n\ntestimony   under      Rule    702   \"must   be    solely    on    principles   and\n\nmethodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\"                 Daubert,\n\n509 U.S. at 595.       This distinction means that \"[w]hen the factual\n\nunderpinning of an expert's opinion is weak, it is a matter\n\naffecting the weight and credibility of the testimony\" and thus \"a\n\nquestion to be resolved by the jury.\"              Milward I, 639 F.3d at 22\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n            At the same time, \"nothing in either Daubert or the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit\n\nopinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\n\nipse dixit of the expert.\"             Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\n\n136, 146 (1997).       Indeed, Daubert made clear that to be admissible\n\nunder   Rule    702,    an    expert's   opinion     \"must    be    supported   by\n\nappropriate validation\" and rest on \"more than subjective belief\n\nor unsupported speculation.\"           509 U.S. at 590.      Thus, in assessing\n\nwhether   the   expert       opinion   has   the   requisite       validation   for\n                                       - 19 -\n\fpurposes of Rule 702, a court may conclude that it does not\n\nbecause, given the record at hand, \"there is simply too great an\n\nanalytical   gap   between   the   data     and   the   opinion   proffered.\"\n\nJoiner, 522 U.S. at 146.\n\n          We note that \"[t]he party seeking to introduce the\n\nevidence has the burden of establishing both its reliability and\n\nits relevance,\" Milward II, 820 F.3d at 473 (citing Daubert, 509\n\nU.S. at 593 n.10), and that we review a district court's ruling on\n\nthe admissibility of expert testimony under Rule 702 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, assessing \"[p]redicate factual findings\" for \"clear\n\nerror\" and \"pure questions of law . . . de novo,\" id. at 472.\n\n                                     2.\n\n          In its ruling under Rule 702 concerning Dr. James's\n\ntestimony, the District Court explained that Dr. James's expert\n\nreport asserted two opinions about the alleged negligence of Drs.\n\nMateo and V\u00e9lez: that \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated'\n\n[Rodr\u00edguez's] sigmoid colon during the first surgery on April 21,\n\n2016,\" and that \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable\n\nstandards of care\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.               The District\n\nCourt then determined that Dr. James's testimony setting forth\n\nthose two opinions was inadmissible under Rule 702, excluding on\n\nthat basis the entirety of Dr. James's testimony as to Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nand Dr. Mateo.\n\n\n                                   - 20 -\n\f            Notably,   by    excluding      all   of     Dr.     James's     expert\n\ntestimony as to those two defendants, the District Court excluded\n\nDr. James's testimony concerning his opinion that, \"[b]ased on the\n\nmedical documents submitted, it appears that [Rodr\u00edguez] expired\n\nfrom sepsis and septic shock, a condition caused by the perforated\n\nsigmoid colon that occurred in the initial surgery on April 21,\n\n2016 performed by [Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo].\"              The District Court\n\nappears to have done so because it treated Dr. James's opinion in\n\nthat regard as if it were a \"conclu[sion] as a matter of fact that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo 'perforated'\" Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon\n\nduring the April 21 surgery.          Rivera Rodr\u00edguez v. Quality Health\n\nServs. P.R., Civ. No. 18-1287 (PAD), 2022 WL 3445348, at *4 (D.P.R.\n\nAug. 4, 2022).\n\n            To support that aspect of the Rule 702 determination,\n\nthe District Court explained that \"Dr. James seemingly assume[d]\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo [perforated Rodr\u00edguez's colon] because\n\n[Rodr\u00edguez] returned to [HSC] complaining of pelvic pain some days\n\nafter   being   discharged    from    her     first    surgery    [and]    it    was\n\nultimately discovered that she had a perforated colon.\"                Id.      But,\n\nthe District Court explained, such an assumption was \"not enough\n\n[to support] a finding that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated the\n\ncolon[.]\"       Id.    The    District        Court    then      supported      that\n\ndetermination in a footnote by stating that \"Dr. James's conclusion\n\n[was] contradicted by the medical record\" because, several days\n                                     - 21 -\n\fafter the April 21 surgery, on \"April 25, 2016, [Rodr\u00edguez] was\n\ntolerating a regular diet and passing flatus and stool normally\n\nand was deemed ready for discharge.\"          Id. at *4 n.3.    Yet, the\n\nDistrict Court reasoned, Dr. James \"inexplicably state[d] that Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated [Rodr\u00edguez's] colon\" on April 21.\n\nId.\n\n            There is some force to the plaintiffs' contention that\n\nthe District Court erred in this aspect of its ruling under Rule\n\n702 because it wrongly based the ruling on its own assessment of\n\nthe \"factual underpinning\" of the opinion by Dr. James that was\n\nexcluded.    Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595.         As Daubert makes clear,\n\nquestions about the strength of \"the factual underpinning of an\n\nexpert's    opinion\"   are    \"matter[s]    affecting   the   weight   and\n\ncredibility of the testimony\" and therefore \"a question to be\n\nresolved by the jury.\"       Id.\n\n            Moreover, the District Court appears to have understood\n\nthat Dr. James's testimony would set forth the opinion that Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated the colon during the surgery on\n\nApril 21, rather than merely that the colon was perforated during\n\nthat surgery.   While the District Court explained its reasons for\n\nconcluding that testimony by Dr. James that those defendants\n\nperforated the colon at that time was not admissible under Rule\n\n702, it gave no reason for concluding that Rule 702 barred Dr.\n\nJames from simply testifying that the colon was perforated then,\n                                   - 22 -\n\fwithout explicitly attributing the act of perforation to either of\n\nthose defendants.\n\n           Dr. James's expert report, however, opines only that the\n\nperforation of Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon occurred in the initial\n\nsurgery on April 21.        It does not assert at any point that the\n\nperforation occurred due to any action that either Dr. Mateo or\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez took at that time -- or, for that matter, at any other\n\ntime.    Indeed, in that respect, the report accords with the\n\nplaintiffs' operative complaint, which also does not allege at any\n\npoint that Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr. Mateo acted negligently by perforating\n\nRodr\u00edguez's colon.       Instead, the operative complaint alleges that\n\ntheir negligence lay in their \"failure to recognize, appropriately\n\nassess and repair damage to any organs involved in or near the\n\noperative field prior to closing the abdomen\" and their \"failure\n\nto recognize that [Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s] sigmoid colon was damaged in this\n\ncircumstance and to perform an appropriate repair procedure to\n\nassure sigmoid colon integrity before abdominal closure.\"\n\n           Despite   these    potential    problems    with    the   District\n\nCourt's analysis of the admissibility of this specific portion of\n\nDr.   James's   expert    testimony    under   Rule   702,    we   reject   the\n\nplaintiffs' separate contention that the District Court abused its\n\ndiscretion in excluding Dr. James's broad conclusion that \"Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of care\" in\n\ntheir treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.         With respect to that aspect of the\n                                  - 23 -\n\fDistrict   Court's       ruling    under     Rule   702,    Dr.    James's     report\n\nidentifies     no   national      standard    of    care    against    which   those\n\ndefendants'     assertedly     negligent       acts    or   omissions      could   be\n\nmeasured by the trier of fact.             There also is no other basis in\n\nthe record for concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nDr. James's opinion that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo acted negligently\n\nis \"the product of reliable principles and methods.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702(c).    We thus agree with Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo that the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that Dr. James's opinion that\n\n\"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of\n\ncare\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez could \"only be construed as\n\none   based    on   a    res   ipsa   loquitur        inference,      an   inference\n\ninsufficient to withstand scrutiny in this setting.\"                           Rivera\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 2022 WL 3445348, at *4 (citing L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez v.

Evid. 702.\"), aff'd L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez, 32 F.4th 87).\n\n              The question that now remains, with respect to the\n\nplaintiffs' challenge to the grant of summary judgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nand Dr. Mateo, is whether that challenge has merit, given that the\n\nDistrict Court properly excluded Dr. James's conclusion that Drs.\n                                      - 24 -\n\fV\u00e9lez and Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of care.                       As we\n\nwill   next    explain,     we   conclude       that   the    answer   is    that    the\n\nchallenge has none.\n\n                                           3.\n\n              To   be    sure,   as   we   have   explained,     it    may   be     that\n\ntestimony from Dr. James that Rodr\u00edguez's colon was perforated\n\nduring the April 21 surgery was wrongly excluded under Rule 702.\n\nBut even if we were to assume as much, there still would be no\n\nbasis in the record from which a reasonable juror could conclude\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo were negligent as alleged, given that\n\nthe District Court did not err in excluding Dr. James's testimony\n\nthat \"Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards\n\nof care\" in their treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n              We recognize that the plaintiffs do contend that the\n\nDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment was in error because,\n\neven without Dr. James's opinion as to Dr. V\u00e9lez's and Dr. Mateo's\n\nnegligence, the plaintiffs could have relied at trial on the\n\ntestimony of the defendants' expert witnesses to \"help the jury to\n\ndetermine both the proper standards of care and the causal nexus\n\nbetween     [the]       defendants'    negligence       and    [the    p]laintiffs'\n\ndamages.\"      To support this contention, the plaintiffs point out\n\nthat none of the defendants' expert witnesses' reports expressly\n\nrefutes Dr. James's conclusion that Rodr\u00edguez \"expired from sepsis\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fand septic shock, a condition caused by the perforated sigmoid\n\ncolon that occurred in the initial surgery on April 21, 2016.\"\n\n          In    granting   the    defendants'    motions    for   summary\n\njudgment, however, the District Court determined that it was\n\n\"irrelevant    whether   [the]   defendants'    experts'   reports   . . .\n\nrefute Dr. James'[s] conclusion\" that Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon\n\nwas perforated during her initial surgery.7       As the District Court\n\nnoted, all of the defendants' experts opined that the \"defendants'\n\nactions did not deviate from the standards of care.\"         As such, the\n\nDistrict Court concluded that the defense experts' trial testimony\n\nwould not \"align . . . with [the] plaintiffs' legal theories or\n\notherwise lend any support to their case.\"         And, upon a thorough\n\nreview of the evidentiary record, we find no basis on which to\n\ndisagree with the determination that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo were\n\nentitled to summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n7    We note that the District Court gave as one ground for\nrejecting this challenge to the grant of summary judgment the\nabsence of any evidence in the record that would permit a\nreasonable juror to find that the colon was perforated on April\n21. But, for the reasons we have explained, there would be such\nevidence in the record if the District Court erred in excluding\nunder Rule 702 Dr. James's opinion as to when the colon was\nperforated. Thus, we address above the District Court's grounds\nfor rejecting the plaintiffs' challenge to its summary judgment\nruling on the understanding that such evidence would be in the\nrecord, as, for present purposes, we are assuming it was error to\nexclude that aspect of Dr. James's testimony.\n                                  - 26 -\n\f              None of the defendants' experts' reports sets forth any\n\nopinion      that   would    support    the    plaintiffs'       theory    that   any\n\nnegligent     act     or   omission    by   Dr.    V\u00e9lez    or   Dr.   Mateo    caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez's decline and/or her premature death.                     In his report,\n\nDr. Mateo's proffered expert, Dr. Alfredo S. Col\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez,\n\nconcluded that Dr. Mateo's \"involvement in this complicated case\n\n[did] not deviate[] from the standards of care\" applicable to the\n\nprocedures in which he participated.                 And Dr. V\u00e9lez's proffered\n\nexpert, Dr. Adri\u00e1n Col\u00f3n Laracuente, concluded in his report that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez \"did not deviate from the standard of care in her\n\ntreatment\" of Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n              True, if the District Court had admitted Dr. James's\n\nopinion that Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon was perforated during the\n\nApril   21    surgery      performed   by     Drs.   Mateo    and   V\u00e9lez,     then   a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could have inferred that Rodr\u00edguez's\n\neventual death from sepsis and septic shock resulted from the\n\nsurgery on that date.            But even if the trier of fact could\n\nreasonably infer causation from that opinion, the record would\n\nstill lack any basis for a finding that either Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr.\n\nMateo committed any breach of an applicable standard of care that\n\nled to the perforation of Rodr\u00edguez's sigmoid colon during that\n\nsurgery.\n\n              Thus,    the   record    in   this     case    contains     no   \"expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n                                       - 27 -\n\fdefendant doctor[s']   failure to meet it,\" as is required      to\n\n\"establish[] a breach of a physician's duty of care\" under Puerto\n\nRico's negligence statute.     Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 190.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo.\n\n                                III.\n\n          Having affirmed the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendants Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo, we now must address\n\nthe plaintiffs' challenge to the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to Quality Health/HSC.    Here, too, the plaintiffs base\n\ntheir challenge both on a contention that the District Court erred\n\nin excluding under Rule 702 the expert testimony of Dr. James and,\n\nin the alternative, on the ground that the District Court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Quality Health/HSC even assuming that\n\nsuch testimony was properly excluded.\n\n          In pressing their challenge to this summary judgment\n\nruling, the plaintiffs appear to be advancing two distinct theories\n\nby which their claim of negligence against Quality Health/HSC may\n\nsurvive that defendant's motion for summary judgment. One of these\n\ntheories is predicated on HSC staff's alleged failure to utilize\n\nproper hygiene in their care of Rodr\u00edguez. The other is predicated\n\non HSC staff's alleged failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ncomorbidity of diabetes.     We address each of these theories of\n\nliability separately, addressing, with respect to each, both the\n                               - 28 -\n\fplaintiffs' challenge to the relevant Rule 702 ruling as to Dr.\n\nJames's testimony and their contention that, even assuming the\n\nRule 702 ruling was sound, the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth/HSC was not.\n\n                                A.\n\n          Insofar as the plaintiffs premise their challenge to the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Quality Health/HSC on HSC\n\nstaff's alleged hygiene-related failures, they do so in part by\n\nchallenging the District Court's decision to exclude Dr. James's\n\ntestimony under Rule 702.   The plaintiffs argue that Dr. James's\n\nexpert report \"clearly express[ed]\" multiple \"deficiencies\" in HSC\n\nstaff's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.      And it is true that several of\n\nthose alleged deficiencies relate to the plaintiffs' allegation\n\nthat HSC staff utilized \"inappropriate and poor hygiene at [HSC]\n\nand in the care of [Rodr\u00edguez].\"     In that regard, the plaintiffs\n\nrefer to several facts that Dr. James asserts in his expert report\n\nleave \"little room for doubt regarding the inappropriate nature\n\nand poor hygiene which was utilized by [HSC] personnel in caring\n\nfor [Rodr\u00edguez]\" -- such as the presence of \"several organisms\n\nthroughout her various organ systems\" and \"worms and/or maggots\"\n\nin her nostril, the lack of \"evidence of appropriate disinfection\n\nof the hospital room, equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n\nherself,\" and the fact that Rodr\u00edguez's \"fecal collector remained\n\nout of place for more than 24 hours.\"\n                              - 29 -\n\f             Nothing    in    Dr.    James's      report    purports       to    opine,\n\nhowever,     that   any     of   these     hygiene-related         failures     caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez's decline or premature death.                   Nor is there any other\n\nevidence     in   the   summary     judgment      record    that    the   plaintiffs\n\nidentify that would provide a basis on which a reasonable trier of\n\nfact could find such causation.             And that is true even if we take\n\naccount of the testimony of the defendants' own expert witnesses.\n\n             That   being    so,    we    do   not   see    how    the    plaintiffs'\n\nchallenge to the District Court's ruling to exclude Dr. James's\n\ntestimony under Rule 702 provides any support for their challenge\n\nto the grant of summary judgment to Quality Health/HSC insofar as\n\nthat challenge rests on a claim of negligence owing to HSC staff's\n\nhygiene-related failures in their care for Rodr\u00edguez.                      After all,\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim of negligence is that the \"premature death\n\nof [Rodr\u00edguez] was caused by the negligent management of her\n\ncondition.\"       Accordingly, even if we were to assume that there is\n\nmerit   to   the    plaintiffs'      challenge       to    the    District      Court's\n\nexclusionary ruling under Rule 702 with respect to Dr. James's\n\ntestimony concerning the poor hygiene-related practices of HSC\n\nstaff, the plaintiffs' challenge to the grant of summary judgment\n\nto Quality Health/HSC fails insofar as it rests on the allegation\n\nthat HSC staff's failures in that regard caused Rodr\u00edguez's decline\n\nand premature death.\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f                                              B.\n\n           We turn, then, to the plaintiffs' remaining contention\n\nas to their challenge to the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth/HSC -- a contention that rests on the theory that HSC\n\nstaff's failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez's comorbidity of\n\ndiabetes led to her decline and premature death.                         Here, too, the\n\nplaintiffs contend in part that the District Court erred in\n\nexcluding Dr. James's report under Rule 702.                           But, once again,\n\nthey also contend in the alternative that, even if that ruling was\n\nsound, the grant of summary judgment was not because they could\n\nhave   relied    on       other    evidence        in   the    record    to    prove       this\n\nallegation.\n\n           With respect to the plaintiffs' challenge to the Rule\n\n702 ruling, Dr. James's report contains the opinion that \"poor\n\nmanagement      of       [Rodr\u00edguez's]        medical     comorbidities,            such     as\n\ninadequate      care      for     her   diabetes[,]           likely    exacerbated         her\n\ncondition and accelerated her demise.\"                    With this assertion, Dr.\n\nJames clearly opines that HSC staff's management of Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ndiabetes   was       a   cause    of    her   premature         death.        And   he     also\n\ncharacterizes that management as \"poor\" and \"inadequate.\"\n\n           Nonetheless, the District Court determined that this\n\nopinion must be excluded because \"nowhere in the report does Dr.\n\nJames identify the standard of care that [HSC] staff should have\n\nadhered to\" in their management of Rodr\u00edguez's diabetes; \"where\n                                         - 31 -\n\fthat standard comes from; and how the staff deviated from that\n\nstandard.\"   We agree.\n\n           In the absence of both an articulated standard of care\n\nand any specific allegations of acts or omissions by HSC staff\n\nthat deviated from that standard of care, we cannot see that Dr.\n\nJames's   opinion   that    HSC   staff's    management      of   Rodr\u00edguez's\n\ndiabetes was \"poor\" and \"inadequate\" is \"the product of reliable\n\nprinciples and methods,\" as Rule 702 requires.                Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702(c).   Thus, even if we were to assume that it was error for the\n\nDistrict Court to have excluded Dr. James's testimony that HSC\n\nstaff's treatment of Rodr\u00edguez's diabetes caused her decline and\n\npremature death, we see no basis for concluding that it was error\n\nto exclude the portion of Dr. James's opinion that pertains to\n\nwhether that treatment was improper.\n\n           This   aspect    of    our   assessment     of   the   plaintiffs'\n\nchallenge to the District Court's Rule 702 exclusion ends up being\n\ndispositive of their summary judgment challenge.            That is because,\n\nwith Dr. James's opinion pertaining to a breach of the duty of\n\ncare excluded, there is nothing else in the summary judgment record\n\nthat could make up for it.\n\n           None of the defendants' expert witnesses opines that HSC\n\nstaff's   management   of   Rodr\u00edguez's     diabetes    deviated    from   any\n\napplicable standard of care. On the contrary, Quality Health/HSC's\n\nproffered expert witness, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez,\n                                   - 32 -\n\fopines in her expert report that \"at all times relevant to the\n\n[operative]     Complaint,   [HSC]     personnel   acted   diligently,\n\nprudently[,] and reasonably and did not incurred in [sic] negligent\n\nacts.\"      Thus, without the existence in the record of \"expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n\ndefendant doctor[s'] failure to meet it,\" Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, 111\n\nF.3d at 190, we affirm the District Court's determination that\n\nQuality Health/HSC was entitled to summary judgment in its favor\n\non the plaintiffs' claim of medical malpractice.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 33 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 22-1776\n\n LOURDES RIVERA RODR\u00cdGUEZ; MARIA DE LOS ANGELES RAMOS RODR\u00cdGUEZ;\n                  and RAFAEL PACHECO RODR\u00cdGUEZ,\n\n                     Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                               v.\n\n HOSPITAL SAN CRISTOBAL, INC.; QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES OF PUERTO\n RICO, INC.; IRIS V\u00c9LEZ GARC\u00cdA; ZACAR\u00cdAS A.

The suit seeks to recover under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw for the allegedly negligent care that Rodr\u00edguez received at\n\nHSC during and following an abdominal surgery performed by Dr.\n\nIris V\u00e9lez Garc\u00eda (&quot;Dr. V\u00e9lez&quot;) and Dr. Zacar\u00edas A.

Rodr\u00edguez -- who was then seventy-one years old\n\nand   living    with    several   chronic      health   conditions    including\n\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, and asthma -- was examined by Dr.\n\n\n\n\n1    Unless otherwise specified, all quotations in this section\nare drawn from reports prepared by the parties&#x27; proffered expert\nwitnesses summarizing the medical records from Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s visits\nto HSC.\n                                    - 1 -\n\fV\u00e9lez, who had been her regular gynecologist since 2005. Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\nrecommended that Rodr\u00edguez undergo a bilateral oophorectomy via\n\nlaparotomy after a pelvic ultrasound revealed a &quot;complex cystic\n\nmass&quot; near Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s right ovary.\n\n            Dr. V\u00e9lez performed Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s surgery on April 21,\n\n2016, at HSC.        During the surgery, Dr. V\u00e9lez discovered that\n\nRodr\u00edguez had a &quot;frozen pelvis&quot; with multiple &quot;intraabdominal\n\nadhesions,&quot; and so she requested a surgical consultation from Dr.\n\nMateo, another gynecologist on HSC&#x27;s staff.                   Dr. Mateo assisted\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez with Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s surgery.               On April 25, 2016, Rodr\u00edguez\n\nwas discharged from HSC after HSC staff observed &quot;positive bowel\n\nsounds&quot; and Rodr\u00edguez reported &quot;positive stool passage.&quot;\n\n            Four   days     later,    on    April      29,   during    a    scheduled\n\npostoperative      appointment       with   Dr.     V\u00e9lez    at   HSC,      Rodr\u00edguez\n\nreported that she had been experiencing &quot;nausea, vomiting, and\n\nabdominal/pelvic pain since April 26.&quot; Rodr\u00edguez was then admitted\n\nto HSC&#x27;s emergency department and was diagnosed with a presumed\n\nperforated sigmoid colon.        Later that day, Rodr\u00edguez underwent an\n\nemergency    exploratory       laparotomy         to    address       her    presumed\n\nperforated colon, during which Dr. V\u00e9lez, Dr. Mateo, and one Dr.\n\nOrtiz Rosado2 performed a &quot;partial colectomy with Hartman[n] pouch,\n\nend   colostomy[,]    and    subtotal       hysterectomy.&quot;         Rodr\u00edguez      was\n\n\n\n2     Dr. Ortiz Rosado is not a party to this suit.\n                                       - 2 -\n\fsubsequently admitted to HSC&#x27;s intensive care unit (&quot;ICU&quot;) in\n\ncritical condition.      She was intubated on a respirator with a\n\nnasogastric (&quot;NG&quot;) tube, a colostomy bag, and a Foley catheter.\n\n           In   HSC&#x27;s   ICU,   Rodr\u00edguez    received   care   from    various\n\nspecialists, including Dr. V\u00e9lez and staff from HSC&#x27;s &quot;general\n\nsurgery,   internal     medicine,    infectious   disease,     cardiology,\n\npulmonology,      nephrology,       hematology/oncology,       and       ENT&quot;\n\ndepartments.    Two days after her admission to the ICU, on May 1,\n\nRodr\u00edguez was diagnosed with &quot;bacteremia/sepsis.&quot;         Then, on May 4,\n\nRodr\u00edguez tested positive for pseudomonas bacteria, at which point\n\nHSC&#x27;s &quot;infection control program became involved&quot; with her care.\n\nHSC&#x27;s   epidemiology     department     recommended     several      specific\n\ndisinfection protocols to treat Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s pseudomonas infection,\n\nbut &quot;[t]here is no documentation that these recommendations were\n\ncarried out at any time.&quot;\n\n           On May 6, HSC staff discovered that Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s stoma\n\nhad become necrotic.       Rodr\u00edguez consequently underwent a third\n\nsurgical procedure consisting of &quot;an exploratory laparotomy, ileal\n\nresection, transverse colon loop colostomy, enterography, and\n\nenteroclysis.&quot; Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Ortiz Rosado performed this third\n\nsurgery.    Rodr\u00edguez was then returned to the ICU, where she\n\ncontinued to receive care from HSC staff.\n\n           On May 12, nursing and infectious-disease staff noted\n\n&quot;the presence of worms and/or maggots in the right nostril of\n                                    - 3 -\n\f[Rodr\u00edguez], where the NG tube was located.&quot;         A CT scan of\n\nRodr\u00edguez&#x27;s sinuses was ordered, but there was otherwise &quot;little\n\nto no documentation of [any] consultations regarding the presence\n\nof worms nor any analysis of the source of these worms.&quot;\n\n          On May 15, it was &quot;documented that [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s] fecal\n\ncollector [was] out of place.&quot;    The following day, HSC staff noted\n\nthat the fecal collector &quot;continue[d] to be displaced and that\n\nthere [was] abundant fecal material around the site [of the fecal\n\ncollector] as well as coming from&quot; an &quot;open wound&quot; near the site.\n\n          On May 18, two types of bacteria were detected in\n\ncultures of fluid taken from Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s abdomen.    That same day,\n\nHSC staff noted that Rodr\u00edguez was &quot;no longer responding to verbal\n\nor physical stimuli.&quot;      By the following afternoon, HSC staff\n\ndetermined that Rodr\u00edguez could not undergo a planned fourth\n\nprocedure &quot;due to worsening of her condition,&quot; and they obtained\n\na &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; order from Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s family.      Rodr\u00edguez\n\ndied later that evening, at 8:48 P.M. on May 19, 2016.\n\n          An autopsy determined that Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s cause of death\n\nwas &quot;peritonitis due to sigmoid colon perforation with associated\n\nsepsis and septic shock.     Complicating factors were congestive\n\nheart   failure,    bilateral    bronchopneumonia,   and    diabetic\n\nketoacidosis.&quot;   The autopsy also showed &quot;multiple pressure ulcers&quot;\n\non Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s body.\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f                                      B.\n\n            The plaintiffs filed suit in the District Court on May\n\n11, 2018.

The\n\nplaintiffs asserted that Dr. James would\n\n            testify as a medical expert in obstetrics,\n            gynecology[,] and general medicine about his\n            professional qualifications, his review of the\n            medical records in this case, the applicable\n            medical standards, his expert report and\n            deposition   testimony,    the   reports    of\n            defendants&#x27; experts, his professional opinion\n            as to the departures from the medical\n            standards by defendants in the treatment\n            provided to [Rodr\u00edguez] and their causal\n            relationship with [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s] injuries and\n            premature death[,] and about any applicable\n            medical literature in support of his opinion.\n\nThe plaintiffs also &quot;reserve[d] the right to use as their own any\n\nexpert witness announced by the defendants.&quot;\n                                   - 7 -\n\f               Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo represented that they would each\n\ncall an      expert witness       of their own, and      Quality Health/HSC\n\nrepresented that it would call its own expert witness as well.\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez represented that her expert, Dr. Adri\u00e1n Col\u00f3n Laracuente,\n\nwould testify as to Dr. V\u00e9lez&#x27;s treatment of Rodr\u00edguez &quot;from the\n\ngynecological and surgical standpoint . . . and her compliance\n\nwith the standard of care.&quot; Dr. Mateo represented that his expert,\n\ngynecological specialist Dr. Alfredo S. Col\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez, would\n\ntestify &quot;regarding his opinion that Dr. Mateo complied with all\n\nthe applicable medical standards while providing assistance during\n\nthe    two   surgical   interventions      to   [Rodr\u00edguez]     in   which   his\n\nassistance was requested.&quot;           Quality Health/HSC represented that\n\nits expert, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez, would testify\n\nas    to   &quot;the   standard   of    care   applicable    to   this    case,   the\n\ncorrectness of the treatment given to&quot; Rodr\u00edguez by HSC staff,\n\n&quot;and    that    such   treatment    did   not   cause   [the]   plaintiff[s&#x27;]\n\ndamages.&quot;\n\n               Following a pretrial conference, the District Court\n\nreferred the case to a magistrate judge for mediation.               Mediation\n\nwas unsuccessful, in part because the defendants represented at\n\nthe settlement conference that they intended to file motions in\n\nlimine, the resolution of which had the potential to affect the\n\nparties&#x27; settlement efforts.\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\f          Two separate motions in limine were filed -- one by\n\nQuality Health/HSC and the other by Dr. Mateo, Berris Castillo,\n\nand the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership, joined by Dr. V\u00e9lez.\n\nThe motions sought to exclude the expert opinion testimony of the\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; expert, Dr. James.          Both motions argued that Dr.\n\nJames&#x27;s testimony must be excluded because his expert report did\n\nnot comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) and because,\n\neven if the report did, the plaintiffs had not met their burden\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to show that his testimony was\n\nadmissible.\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 requires parties in\n\ncivil cases to disclose their witnesses. Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires\n\nthat the disclosure of any witness &quot;retained or specially employed\n\nto provide expert testimony&quot; include a written report prepared and\n\nsigned by the expert witness which &quot;must contain,&quot; among other\n\nrequirements, &quot;a complete statement of all opinions the witness\n\nwill express and the basis and reasons for them.&quot;         Rule 26(e)(2)\n\nthen requires that the proponent of an expert witness &quot;supplement&quot;\n\ntheir   initial   disclosure   to    alert   opposing   parties   to   any\n\nsubsequent &quot;additions or changes&quot; to the content of the expert&#x27;s\n\ntestimony.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1), meanwhile,\n\nprovides that &quot;[i]f a party fails to provide information                or\n\nidentify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is\n\nnot allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence\n                                    - 9 -\n\fon a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was\n\nsubstantially justified or is harmless.&quot;\n\n            Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility\n\nof expert opinion testimony.             It provides that a qualified expert\n\nwitness &quot;may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise&quot; only\n\nif   the   party    seeking      to   introduce      the    witness&#x27;s     testimony\n\ndemonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) the\n\nwitness&#x27;s &quot;scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n\nwill help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n\ndetermine   a     fact    in   issue&quot;;    (b)    &quot;the   testimony    is   based   on\n\nsufficient facts or data&quot;; (c) &quot;the testimony is the product of\n\nreliable principles and methods&quot;; and (d) &quot;the expert&#x27;s opinion\n\nreflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to\n\nthe facts of the case.&quot;          Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n            Dr.     James&#x27;s      expert     report      first     summarized      his\n\nqualifications       as    a    licensed        physician    and    gynecological\n\nspecialist &quot;well versed in the current standards of care applicable\n\nto the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.&quot;                  Dr. James&#x27;s report\n\nstated that, &quot;[i]n this matter, [his] opinions [were] based on\n\n[certain enumerated] medical records and documents . . . and on\n\nreliable and accepted scientific principles to a reasonable degree\n\nof medical certainty.&quot;          The report next stated that Dr. James had\n\nreviewed the hospital records associated with Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s stays at\n\nHSC between April 21 and April 25, 2016, and between April 29 and\n                                      - 10 -\n\fMay 19, 2016, as well as Dr. V\u00e9lez&#x27;s office records pertaining to\n\nher care of Rodr\u00edguez since 2005.       The report then recited the\n\nfacts of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s case and closed with Dr. James&#x27;s &quot;Comment&quot; on\n\nthe case.    In that &quot;Comment&quot; section, Dr. James wrote:\n\n            Based on the medical documents submitted, it\n            appears that [Rodr\u00edguez] expired from sepsis\n            and septic shock, a condition caused by the\n            perforated sigmoid colon that occurred in the\n            initial surgery on April 21, 2016 performed by\n            Dr. [V\u00e9lez] and Dr. [Mateo].      This patient\n            encountered several organisms throughout her\n            various organ systems: Klebsiella pneumonia,\n            Pseudomonas   aeruginosa,   and   Enterococcus\n            faecalis in the blood, in the inguinal and\n            perianal secretions, in the urine, in the\n            colostomy, and in the throat, as noted in the\n            autopsy report.       In addition, the most\n            surprising finding was the worms and/or\n            maggots that were noted to be present in the\n            nostril of the patient where the NG tube was\n            placed.    There is little room for doubt\n            regarding the inappropriate nature and poor\n            hygiene which was utilized by the hospital\n            personnel in caring for [Rodr\u00edguez]. There is\n            poor documentation regarding this unusual\n            discovery and no evidence that appropriate\n            precautions were taken to prevent this\n            occurrence or to remedy the situation once it\n            was realized.      There is no evidence of\n            appropriate disinfection of the hospital room,\n            equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n            herself as recommended by infectious disease\n            and epidemiology. In addition, there appears\n            to be poor management of [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s] medical\n            comorbidities, such as inadequate care for her\n            diabetes   which    likely   exacerbated   her\n            condition and accelerated her demise.       It\n            appears that her fecal collector remained out\n            of place for more than 24 hours after\n            discovering it had become dislodged, allowing\n            fecal material to contaminate the stoma as\n            well as the open wound itself. Further, there\n            is evidence on autopsy of multiple pressure\n                               - 11 -\n\f           ulcers, which lends further evidence of the\n           substandard care that [Rodr\u00edguez] received\n           during her admission at [HSC].\n\n           In conclusion, it is my opinion -- based upon\n           a     reasonable     degree     of     medical\n           certainty -- that in the case discussed above\n           there were numerous deviations, failures, and\n           departures from acceptable standards of care\n           on the part of Dr. [V\u00e9lez], Dr. Mateo, as well\n           as on the part of [HSC] and its staff.\n\n           In their motions to exclude Dr. James&#x27;s expert testimony\n\nunder Rule 26, the defendants argued that Dr. James&#x27;s expert report\n\n&quot;fail[ed] to state the totality of his opinions in this case . . .\n\nconsidering the scope of the testimony stated in the Pretrial\n\nReport and which [the p]laintiffs apparently intend[ed] to present\n\nat trial.&quot; The defendants further contended that the report &quot;[did]\n\nnot state the applicable standards of care; [did] not specify\n\nwhether the standards of care are applicable on a national basis;\n\n[did] not state how the applicable standards were specifically\n\nbreached&quot;; did not explain how the defendants&#x27; &quot;alleged negligence\n\ncaused and/or contributed to [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s] condition and demise&quot;;\n\nand was &quot;conspicuously lacking in reference or citations to medical\n\nliterature.&quot;      Accordingly, the defendants argued that Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony had to be excluded under Rule 37(c).\n\n           Alternatively, the defendants argued that Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony should be &quot;excluded as speculative&quot; under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 702.      They contended that was so because Dr. James&#x27;s\n\nexpert   report    did   not   articulate   either   a   &quot;[s]cientifically\n                                   - 12 -\n\facceptable    methodology&quot;         or   &quot;the     bases      and   foundations    that\n\nunderlie [his] expert opinion&quot; and because nothing else in the\n\nrecord enabled the plaintiffs to meet their burden to show that\n\nhis testimony was admissible under Rule 702.\n\n             The   plaintiffs      opposed       the    defendants&#x27;       motions   to\n\nexclude Dr. James&#x27;s testimony.             The plaintiffs did not request,\n\nhowever, that the District Court hold a hearing on the merits of\n\nthe motions at which Dr. James could testify.                   Nor did they request\n\nleave to supplement Dr. James&#x27;s expert report.                           Instead, the\n\nplaintiffs    argued   that     the     entirety       of   Dr.    James&#x27;s   proposed\n\ntestimony was admissible based on the expert report itself.\n\n             The District Court granted the defendants&#x27; motions to\n\nexclude Dr. James&#x27;s testimony.            In so ruling, the District Court\n\nrelied entirely on Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\n\n             As to Dr. V\u00e9lez&#x27;s and Dr. Mateo&#x27;s motion under Rule 702\n\nto exclude Dr. James&#x27;s testimony, the District Court reasoned that\n\nDr. James&#x27;s expert report &quot;conclude[d] as a matter of fact that\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo &#x27;perforated&#x27; [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s] sigmoid colon\n\nduring the first surgery on April 21, 2016&quot; but provided &quot;no\n\nexplanation&quot; for that conclusion, instead &quot;seemingly assum[ing]\n\nthat Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo did so because [Rodr\u00edguez] returned\n\nto   [HSC]   complaining      of    pelvic     pain      some     days   after   being\n\ndischarged&quot; and was found to have had a perforated sigmoid colon\n\nat that time.      The District Court held that that assumption was\n                                        - 13 -\n\f&quot;not enough for a finding that Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo perforated\n\nthe colon.&quot;     The District Court further observed that although Dr.\n\nJames &quot;conclude[d that] Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from\n\nacceptable standards of care,&quot; his report did not &quot;state what those\n\nstandards are, nor where they come from[, nor] how Dr. V\u00e9lez and\n\nDr. Mateo deviated from them.&quot;\n\n            As to Quality Health/HSC&#x27;s motion under Rule 702 to\n\nexclude Dr. James&#x27;s testimony, the District Court concluded that\n\nDr. James&#x27;s opinions regarding the alleged negligence of HSC staff\n\n&quot;fare[d]   no   better&quot;   than    his   opinions    regarding     the   alleged\n\nnegligence of Drs. Mateo and V\u00e9lez.         And that was so, the District\n\nCourt explained, even though the report pointed to several alleged\n\ndepartures from acceptable standards of care, because &quot;nowhere in\n\n[his] report [did] Dr. James identify the standard of care that\n\n[HSC&#x27;s] hospital staff should have adhered to; where that standard\n\ncomes from; and how the staff deviated from that standard.&quot;\n\n            At the same time that the District Court granted the\n\ndefendants&#x27; motions to exclude Dr. James&#x27;s testimony under Rule\n\n702, the District Court also granted the defendants&#x27; requested\n\nleave to move for summary judgment within ten days.                Dr. Mateo,\n\nBerris Castillo, and the Mateo-Castillo conjugal partnership moved\n\nfor summary judgment seven days later, which motion Dr. V\u00e9lez\n\njoined;    Quality   Health/HSC    filed    its    own   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment two days later.\n                                   - 14 -\n\f            The    plaintiffs       opposed       both    motions    for     summary\n\njudgment, arguing that even if Dr. James&#x27;s testimony were excluded,\n\nthey   could     rely   on    the   testimony      of    the   defendants&#x27;    expert\n\nwitnesses to prove their case.            In the alternative, the plaintiffs\n\nasked the District Court to reconsider its ruling excluding Dr.\n\nJames&#x27;s expert testimony, as they contended that the defendants\n\nwere not entitled to summary judgment if Dr. James&#x27;s testimony\n\nwere not excluded.\n\n            The District Court denied the plaintiffs&#x27; request for\n\nreconsideration,        granted     the   defendants&#x27;      motions   for     summary\n\njudgment, dismissed the plaintiffs&#x27; claims with prejudice, and\n\nentered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs timely\n\nappealed the District Court&#x27;s entry of summary judgment.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            We    first      address   the      plaintiffs&#x27;     challenge    to   the\n\nDistrict Court&#x27;s grant of summary judgment to Dr. V\u00e9lez and Dr.\n\nMateo.   &quot;&#x27;To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving\n\nparty must demonstrate the existence of a trialworthy issue as to\n\nsome material fact,&#x27; i.e., a fact that &#x27;potentially could affect\n\nthe suit&#x27;s outcome.&#x27;&quot;          L\u00f3pez-Ram\u00edrez v.

Mateo and\n\nV\u00e9lez were entitled to summary judgment in part on its decision to\n\nexclude   Dr.   James&#x27;s   expert     testimony   under    Rule   702.    The\n\nplaintiffs now contend that this Rule 702 ruling was in error.\n\nThe   plaintiffs   do   not    suggest   in   advancing   that   contention,\n\nhowever, that they can meet their burden to show that Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony is admissible under Rule 702 based on anything extrinsic\n\nto his expert report.4        The plaintiffs simply contend based on the\n\nreport itself that the District Court abused its discretion in\n\nruling that the plaintiffs had failed to meet that burden.5              The\n\nplaintiffs then go on to contend, in the alternative, that we must\n\n\n\n4    The plaintiffs assert as part of their challenge to the\nDistrict Court&#x27;s Rule 702 ruling that the District Court&#x27;s decision\nto exclude Dr. James&#x27;s report altogether after finding it deficient\nwas &quot;too extreme of a sanction&quot; -- but they conceded at oral\nargument that they never requested leave to amend Dr. James&#x27;s\nexpert report to cure its alleged deficiencies, and they point to\nno authority suggesting that the District Court should have sua\nsponte granted them leave to do so before excluding the testimony.\n5    Although the plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred\nby not holding a Daubert hearing on the admissibility of Dr.\nJames&#x27;s testimony before granting the defendants&#x27; motions in\nlimine to exclude it, the contention fails for the same reasons we\nrejected a similar contention in Gonz\u00e1lez-Arroyo v.

And that is so, they\n\ncontend, because of evidence in the record that is independent of\n\nDr. James&#x27;s testimony.        For the reasons set forth below, we\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs&#x27; grounds for challenging the summary\n\njudgment ruling have no merit.\n\n                                   A.\n\n          To   assess   the   plaintiffs&#x27;   challenge   to   the   summary\n\njudgment ruling at issue, it helps to focus first on the aspect of\n\nthat challenge that concerns the District Court&#x27;s ruling excluding\n\nDr. James&#x27;s testimony under Rule 702.          To do so, we begin by\n\nreviewing the requirements that Rule 702 sets forth before then\n\nturning back to the District Court&#x27;s Rule 702 ruling.          With that\n\nfoundation in place, we then will be well-positioned to explain\n\nwhy the plaintiffs&#x27; challenge to the grant of summary judgment to\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo fails.\n\n                                   1.\n\n          Rule 702 provides in full that:\n\n          A witness who is qualified as an expert by\n          knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n          education may testify in the form of an\n          opinion   or  otherwise if   the  proponent\n          demonstrates to the court that it is more\n          likely than not that:\n\n          (a) the expert&#x27;s scientific, technical, or\n          other specialized knowledge will help the\n          trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n          determine a fact in issue;\n                                 - 17 -\n\f          (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts\n          or data;\n\n          (c) the testimony is the product of reliable\n          principles and methods; and\n\n          (d) the expert\u2019s opinion reflects a reliable\n          application of the principles and methods to\n          the facts of the case.6\n\n          Rule   702,   in   its     present    form,   incorporates   the\n\nreasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\">509 U.S. 579</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).

While the District Court explained its reasons for\n\nconcluding that testimony by Dr. James that those defendants\n\nperforated the colon at that time was not admissible under Rule\n\n702, it gave no reason for concluding that Rule 702 barred Dr.\n\nJames from simply testifying that the colon was perforated then,\n                                   - 22 -\n\fwithout explicitly attributing the act of perforation to either of\n\nthose defendants.\n\n           Dr. James&#x27;s expert report, however, opines only that the\n\nperforation of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s sigmoid colon occurred in the initial\n\nsurgery on April 21.        It does not assert at any point that the\n\nperforation occurred due to any action that either Dr. Mateo or\n\nDr. V\u00e9lez took at that time -- or, for that matter, at any other\n\ntime.    Indeed, in that respect, the report accords with the\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; operative complaint, which also does not allege at any\n\npoint that Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr. Mateo acted negligently by perforating\n\nRodr\u00edguez&#x27;s colon.       Instead, the operative complaint alleges that\n\ntheir negligence lay in their &quot;failure to recognize, appropriately\n\nassess and repair damage to any organs involved in or near the\n\noperative field prior to closing the abdomen&quot; and their &quot;failure\n\nto recognize that [Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s] sigmoid colon was damaged in this\n\ncircumstance and to perform an appropriate repair procedure to\n\nassure sigmoid colon integrity before abdominal closure.&quot;\n\n           Despite   these    potential    problems    with    the   District\n\nCourt&#x27;s analysis of the admissibility of this specific portion of\n\nDr.   James&#x27;s   expert    testimony    under   Rule   702,    we   reject   the\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; separate contention that the District Court abused its\n\ndiscretion in excluding Dr. James&#x27;s broad conclusion that &quot;Dr.\n\nV\u00e9lez and Dr. Mateo deviated from acceptable standards of care&quot; in\n\ntheir treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.

Thus, we address above the District Court&#x27;s grounds\nfor rejecting the plaintiffs&#x27; challenge to its summary judgment\nruling on the understanding that such evidence would be in the\nrecord, as, for present purposes, we are assuming it was error to\nexclude that aspect of Dr. James&#x27;s testimony.\n                                  - 26 -\n\f              None of the defendants&#x27; experts&#x27; reports sets forth any\n\nopinion      that   would    support    the    plaintiffs&#x27;       theory    that   any\n\nnegligent     act     or   omission    by   Dr.    V\u00e9lez    or   Dr.   Mateo    caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez&#x27;s decline and/or her premature death.

Mateo    and   V\u00e9lez,     then   a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could have inferred that Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s\n\neventual death from sepsis and septic shock resulted from the\n\nsurgery on that date.            But even if the trier of fact could\n\nreasonably infer causation from that opinion, the record would\n\nstill lack any basis for a finding that either Dr. V\u00e9lez or Dr.\n\nMateo committed any breach of an applicable standard of care that\n\nled to the perforation of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s sigmoid colon during that\n\nsurgery.\n\n              Thus,    the   record    in   this     case    contains     no   &quot;expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n                                       - 27 -\n\fdefendant doctor[s&#x27;]   failure to meet it,&quot; as is required      to\n\n&quot;establish[] a breach of a physician&#x27;s duty of care&quot; under Puerto\n\nRico&#x27;s negligence statute.

Here, too, the plaintiffs base\n\ntheir challenge both on a contention that the District Court erred\n\nin excluding under Rule 702 the expert testimony of Dr. James and,\n\nin the alternative, on the ground that the District Court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Quality Health/HSC even assuming that\n\nsuch testimony was properly excluded.\n\n          In pressing their challenge to this summary judgment\n\nruling, the plaintiffs appear to be advancing two distinct theories\n\nby which their claim of negligence against Quality Health/HSC may\n\nsurvive that defendant&#x27;s motion for summary judgment. One of these\n\ntheories is predicated on HSC staff&#x27;s alleged failure to utilize\n\nproper hygiene in their care of Rodr\u00edguez. The other is predicated\n\non HSC staff&#x27;s alleged failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s\n\ncomorbidity of diabetes.     We address each of these theories of\n\nliability separately, addressing, with respect to each, both the\n                               - 28 -\n\fplaintiffs&#x27; challenge to the relevant Rule 702 ruling as to Dr.\n\nJames&#x27;s testimony and their contention that, even assuming the\n\nRule 702 ruling was sound, the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth/HSC was not.\n\n                                A.\n\n          Insofar as the plaintiffs premise their challenge to the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Quality Health/HSC on HSC\n\nstaff&#x27;s alleged hygiene-related failures, they do so in part by\n\nchallenging the District Court&#x27;s decision to exclude Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony under Rule 702.   The plaintiffs argue that Dr. James&#x27;s\n\nexpert report &quot;clearly express[ed]&quot; multiple &quot;deficiencies&quot; in HSC\n\nstaff&#x27;s treatment of Rodr\u00edguez.      And it is true that several of\n\nthose alleged deficiencies relate to the plaintiffs&#x27; allegation\n\nthat HSC staff utilized &quot;inappropriate and poor hygiene at [HSC]\n\nand in the care of [Rodr\u00edguez].&quot;     In that regard, the plaintiffs\n\nrefer to several facts that Dr. James asserts in his expert report\n\nleave &quot;little room for doubt regarding the inappropriate nature\n\nand poor hygiene which was utilized by [HSC] personnel in caring\n\nfor [Rodr\u00edguez]&quot; -- such as the presence of &quot;several organisms\n\nthroughout her various organ systems&quot; and &quot;worms and/or maggots&quot;\n\nin her nostril, the lack of &quot;evidence of appropriate disinfection\n\nof the hospital room, equipment, hospital staff, and the patient\n\nherself,&quot; and the fact that Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s &quot;fecal collector remained\n\nout of place for more than 24 hours.&quot;\n                              - 29 -\n\f             Nothing    in    Dr.    James&#x27;s      report    purports       to    opine,\n\nhowever,     that   any     of   these     hygiene-related         failures     caused\n\nRodr\u00edguez&#x27;s decline or premature death.                   Nor is there any other\n\nevidence     in   the   summary     judgment      record    that    the   plaintiffs\n\nidentify that would provide a basis on which a reasonable trier of\n\nfact could find such causation.             And that is true even if we take\n\naccount of the testimony of the defendants&#x27; own expert witnesses.\n\n             That   being    so,    we    do   not   see    how    the    plaintiffs&#x27;\n\nchallenge to the District Court&#x27;s ruling to exclude Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony under Rule 702 provides any support for their challenge\n\nto the grant of summary judgment to Quality Health/HSC insofar as\n\nthat challenge rests on a claim of negligence owing to HSC staff&#x27;s\n\nhygiene-related failures in their care for Rodr\u00edguez.                      After all,\n\nthe plaintiffs&#x27; claim of negligence is that the &quot;premature death\n\nof [Rodr\u00edguez] was caused by the negligent management of her\n\ncondition.&quot;       Accordingly, even if we were to assume that there is\n\nmerit   to   the    plaintiffs&#x27;      challenge       to    the    District      Court&#x27;s\n\nexclusionary ruling under Rule 702 with respect to Dr. James&#x27;s\n\ntestimony concerning the poor hygiene-related practices of HSC\n\nstaff, the plaintiffs&#x27; challenge to the grant of summary judgment\n\nto Quality Health/HSC fails insofar as it rests on the allegation\n\nthat HSC staff&#x27;s failures in that regard caused Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s decline\n\nand premature death.\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f                                              B.\n\n           We turn, then, to the plaintiffs&#x27; remaining contention\n\nas to their challenge to the grant of summary judgment to Quality\n\nHealth/HSC -- a contention that rests on the theory that HSC\n\nstaff&#x27;s failure to properly manage Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s comorbidity of\n\ndiabetes led to her decline and premature death.                         Here, too, the\n\nplaintiffs contend in part that the District Court erred in\n\nexcluding Dr. James&#x27;s report under Rule 702.                           But, once again,\n\nthey also contend in the alternative that, even if that ruling was\n\nsound, the grant of summary judgment was not because they could\n\nhave   relied    on       other    evidence        in   the    record    to    prove       this\n\nallegation.\n\n           With respect to the plaintiffs&#x27; challenge to the Rule\n\n702 ruling, Dr. James&#x27;s report contains the opinion that &quot;poor\n\nmanagement      of       [Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s]        medical     comorbidities,            such     as\n\ninadequate      care      for     her   diabetes[,]           likely    exacerbated         her\n\ncondition and accelerated her demise.&quot;                    With this assertion, Dr.\n\nJames clearly opines that HSC staff&#x27;s management of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s\n\ndiabetes   was       a   cause    of    her   premature         death.        And   he     also\n\ncharacterizes that management as &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;inadequate.&quot;\n\n           Nonetheless, the District Court determined that this\n\nopinion must be excluded because &quot;nowhere in the report does Dr.\n\nJames identify the standard of care that [HSC] staff should have\n\nadhered to&quot; in their management of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s diabetes; &quot;where\n                                         - 31 -\n\fthat standard comes from; and how the staff deviated from that\n\nstandard.&quot;   We agree.\n\n           In the absence of both an articulated standard of care\n\nand any specific allegations of acts or omissions by HSC staff\n\nthat deviated from that standard of care, we cannot see that Dr.\n\nJames&#x27;s   opinion   that    HSC   staff&#x27;s    management      of   Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s\n\ndiabetes was &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;inadequate&quot; is &quot;the product of reliable\n\nprinciples and methods,&quot; as Rule 702 requires.                Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702(c).   Thus, even if we were to assume that it was error for the\n\nDistrict Court to have excluded Dr. James&#x27;s testimony that HSC\n\nstaff&#x27;s treatment of Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s diabetes caused her decline and\n\npremature death, we see no basis for concluding that it was error\n\nto exclude the portion of Dr. James&#x27;s opinion that pertains to\n\nwhether that treatment was improper.\n\n           This   aspect    of    our   assessment     of   the   plaintiffs&#x27;\n\nchallenge to the District Court&#x27;s Rule 702 exclusion ends up being\n\ndispositive of their summary judgment challenge.            That is because,\n\nwith Dr. James&#x27;s opinion pertaining to a breach of the duty of\n\ncare excluded, there is nothing else in the summary judgment record\n\nthat could make up for it.\n\n           None of the defendants&#x27; expert witnesses opines that HSC\n\nstaff&#x27;s   management   of   Rodr\u00edguez&#x27;s     diabetes    deviated    from   any\n\napplicable standard of care. On the contrary, Quality Health/HSC&#x27;s\n\nproffered expert witness, internist Dr. Anibelle Altieri Ramirez,\n                                   - 32 -\n\fopines in her expert report that &quot;at all times relevant to the\n\n[operative]     Complaint,   [HSC]     personnel   acted   diligently,\n\nprudently[,] and reasonably and did not incurred in [sic] negligent\n\nacts.&quot;      Thus, without the existence in the record of &quot;expert\n\ntestimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and confirm the\n\ndefendant doctor[s&#x27;] failure to meet it,&quot; Cort\u00e9z-Irizarry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739669\"><a href=\"/opinion/739669/rafaela-cortes-irizarry-v-corporacin-insular-de-seguros/\">111\n\nF.3d at 190</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we affirm the District Court&#x27;s determination that\n\nQuality Health/HSC was entitled to summary judgment in its favor\n\non the plaintiffs&#x27; claim of medical malpractice.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 33 -\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112903/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/196111/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/212992/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/739669/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3197572/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8566283/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925470/", "id": 9925470, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467632/united-states-v-colon-cordero/", "cluster_id": 9467632, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467632/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T14:00:19.537600-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T14:08:54.123119-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "ace685512259cecbbce64f28fe1108abde881001", "page_count": 36, "download_url": "http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/22-1171P-01A.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/united_states_v._colon-cordero.pdf", "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNos. 22-1171\n     22-1172\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                           Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n  LUIS \u00c1NGEL COL\u00d3N-CORDERO, a/k/a Luis El Loco, a/k/a El Loco,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon.

Stephen Muldrow, United States Attorney, and Mariana E.\nBauz\u00e1-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                        January 19, 2024\n\f          THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.        When authorities picked up\n\nLuis \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n-Cordero (Col\u00f3n) for violating some terms of his\n\nsupervised release, they found evidence of other violations as\n\nwell as evidence of new criminal conduct.       And so, another in a\n\nlong line of examples of folks slipping into a criminal-justice-\n\nsystem spin cycle, Col\u00f3n found himself back in court for sentencing\n\nhearings regarding the new criminal case against him and revocation\n\nof his supervised release.     The parties agreed to request within-\n\nguidelines sentences, but the district court, not bound by the\n\nparties' recommendations, imposed an upwardly variant sentence of\n\nimprisonment for the new criminal conduct and a tip-top-of-the-\n\nguidelines-range term of imprisonment for violating his supervised\n\nrelease, with those sentences to run consecutively.       On appeal,\n\nCol\u00f3n raises a number of arguments challenging the pronounced\n\nsentences as unreasonable.     For reasons we'll explain, we vacate\n\nand remand for resentencing.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          We begin with the relevant facts and travel, providing\n\nthe bulk of the particulars now (bear with us) with plans to add\n\nsome more detail later as needed.         As usual when a sentencing\n\nappeal follows a plea of guilty, we draw the facts from the\n\nuncontested   parts   of   the    probation    office's   presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSR), the plea agreement, and the transcript\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fof the sentencing hearing.      See United States v. Morales-Cortijo,\n\n65 F.4th 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2023).\n\n             Col\u00f3n's History, Supervised Release Term,\n                 Violations, and New Criminal Case\n\n           Back in 2017, Col\u00f3n pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\n\npossess   with   intent   to   distribute   controlled   substances   in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and he was sentenced to 45 months\n\nand 19 days of imprisonment and 8 years of supervised release.\n\nCol\u00f3n discharged that term of immurement and was released in 2019,\n\nand from there he began his term of supervised release.\n\n           Now, it is undisputed that Col\u00f3n is a person with an\n\nintellectual disability, and, as the record makes pellucid, he has\n\na history of mental health issues.          Some examples:    a school\n\nreferral prompted him to see a mental health specialist when he\n\nwas 15; he heated a car antenna, then used it to burn his forehead\n\nand under his eyes; he has used cigarettes to burn his forearms\n\nand blades to cut himself; and he has visible scars from his self-\n\ninflicted burning and cutting.      And, as of his 2017 plea, a then-\n\n25-year-old Col\u00f3n had a history of substance abuse, including\n\nsmoking marijuana (25 joints a day) since he was 18, and, at the\n\nsame age, developing a use of non-prescription Xanax, Percocet,\n\nand Klonopin (one or two pills daily), plus occasionally mixing\n\nsome of this drug use with alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 3 -\n\f            And so, as part of his August 2019 supervised release,\n\nCol\u00f3n was referred to substance abuse and mental health treatment.\n\nThe mental health treatment to which Col\u00f3n was later referred in\n\nJanuary 2020 screeched to a halt with the advent of the global\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its resulting lockdowns, but Col\u00f3n continued\n\nhis substance abuse treatment, which he reported he liked going to\n\nand found helpful.    For 14 months during his supervised release\n\nterm (up until he was arrested, anyway), Col\u00f3n tested positive to\n\ncannabinoids two times out of seventeen tests (more on this later)\n\nand failed to report to the drug-testing program once.\n\n            Aside from those two positive drug tests, which were\n\nviolations in and of themselves pursuant to the terms of his\n\nrelease, Col\u00f3n violated another supervised release condition when\n\nhe failed to stay at his address of record (his mother's house).\n\nAfter being called out for moving out, Col\u00f3n returned to his mom's\n\nplace, but he didn't stay put long:     Two days later, probation\n\nreported, he'd again moved out without notice.       In response,\n\nprobation successfully requested an arrest warrant, and local\n\nauthorities searched the place where Col\u00f3n was thought to be\n\nresiding.    During the search, officers found under Col\u00f3n's bed a\n\nloaded AR-style rifle with 30 rounds of ammunition along with an\n\nextra magazine loaded with an additional 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nCol\u00f3n admitted ownership of the rifle, nonchalantly observing to\n\n\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fthe officers \"that he liked rifles.\"            The search team also found\n\npresumptive synthetic marijuana1 and rolling paper in his car.\n\n            A federal grand jury indicted Col\u00f3n on a single count of\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, which generally proscribes certain\n\ncategories of people from possessing firearms or ammunition. Col\u00f3n\n\nwaived   his    preliminary   revocation       hearing      for   the    supervised\n\nrelease violations and on the new charge pleaded guilty to being\n\na felon in possession of ammunition (60 rounds) pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement.2\n\n            The parties proposed in the plea agreement an advisory\n\nguidelines calculation that started with a base offense level of\n\n22, minus three levels for acceptance of responsibility, and\n\ndetermined a total offense level (TOL) of 19.                     And the parties\n\nalso agreed they'd each request a sentence within the to-be-tallied\n\nguidelines     range   for   the   TOL   of    19    when   combined      with   the\n\nundetermined Criminal History Category (CHC).                 The PSR landed on\n\n19 as the TOL, too, then laid out Col\u00f3n's criminal history,\n\nincluding      his   Commonwealth-side        drug    conviction        (possessing\n\ncontrolled substances and drug paraphernalia) and the federal drug\n\nconviction     (conspiracy    to   possess     with    intent      to   distribute\n\n\n     1 The record does not reflect that this substance was ever\ntested and confirmed to be synthetic marijuana.\n     2 The parties agree the agreement's waiver-of-appeal provision\n\ndoes not operate as a bar to this appeal since the provision was\nconditioned on the district court sentencing Col\u00f3n to a term of 46\nmonths' imprisonment or less -- which condition is not met here.\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fnarcotics).    These tabulations dictated a CHC of IV, and, together\n\nwith the TOL of 19, yielded a guidelines sentencing range of 46 to\n\n57 months' imprisonment.\n\n            Each side then filed a sentencing memorandum in support\n\nof its recommended sentence (a low-end 46 months from Col\u00f3n; a\n\nhigh-end 57 months from the government) in anticipation of the\n\nupcoming hearings.\n\n                           The Sentencing Hearings\n\n            Before the district court in February 2022, the first\n\nsentencing matter taken up was Col\u00f3n's new criminal case (the\n\nammunition-possession indictment).          Counsel for Col\u00f3n started with\n\nsome objections to the PSR, two of which are relevant to today's\n\nanalysis.     First, counsel argued the district court should append\n\nto the PSR a psychometric evaluation filed by the expert who'd\n\nexamined Col\u00f3n at defense counsel's request and assessed his\n\nintellectual disability; the district court agreed to do so.              That\n\nmatter squared away, counsel next argued that because the PSR's\n\ndrug-use section described Col\u00f3n's historically heavier use of\n\nsubstances,    the   PSR    impermissibly    suggested   that,   during    his\n\nrelease period, Col\u00f3n had been using more than just the marijuana\n\nto which he'd twice tested positive.              The court signaled in\n\nresponse that it would consider these points in sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\f            Moving to her argument proper, Col\u00f3n's counsel offered\n\nthe following in support of the recommended low-end 46-month\n\nsentence.\n\n            Stating what those in the sentencing world should take\n\nas a given, counsel set the stage by pointing out that the\n\nsentencing court must \"make[] an individualized assessment . . .\n\nof Col\u00f3n\" when pronouncing sentence.            To that end, counsel urged\n\nCol\u00f3n's offense was not a violent one -- it was possession only,\n\nand   his   offense   could    be   explained    by    Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability, which was a big part of why, counsel explained, \"the\n\ncards have always been stacked against\" Col\u00f3n.                That disability\n\nrendered Col\u00f3n -- who has an IQ equivalent to a third-grade\n\neducation, is especially susceptible to peer pressure, and cannot\n\nread or write -- unable to appreciate the amount of ammunition\n\nloaded into the magazines, and his disability also prompted his\n\ncomment that he likes guns.          Drawing on all of this and more,\n\ncounsel beseeched the court to balance this information against\n\nthe need to deter and promote respect for the law when crafting an\n\nindividualized sentence of imprisonment for his non-violent crime.\n\n            The government, on the other hand, sought a 57-month\n\nterm of imprisonment plus a term of supervised release.                      In\n\nsupport,    the   government   submitted    that      Col\u00f3n   \"needs   to   take\n\nindividual responsibility for his actions,\" part of which would be\n\nan acknowledgment that the rifle he possessed while on release\n\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\fwasn't just any gun, it was a \"ghost gun\" (so called because guns\n\nof that variety have no identifying information, such as a serial\n\nnumber) loaded with 30 rounds of ammunition, suggesting he \"was\n\nready to use the rifle if he needed it.\"             The government also\n\npointed to Col\u00f3n's conduct as \"part of a broader [drug-use]\n\nproblem\" -- the government cited his use of \"approximately 25\n\nmarijuana cigarettes per day\" as well as \"daily\" use of Xanax,\n\nPercocet, and Klonopin, not to mention his admission to probation\n\nthat he sometimes mixed prescription drugs and marijuana with\n\nalcohol use.     And, in the government's telling, Col\u00f3n didn't have\n\na history of seeking mental health treatment, instead opting to\n\n\"channel[]\" his anxiety and anger into \"destructive\" activities.\n\n              Citing its review of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\n\nPSR, sentencing memoranda, and a document the court construed as\n\nCol\u00f3n's allocution, the court turned to its own take on sentencing.\n\nThe   court    listed   then-30-year-old   Col\u00f3n's    \"history   of   using\n\nmarijuana and Percocet and Xanax pills without prescriptions,\" and\n\nthat he \"has never received treatment\" for his complained-of\n\nanxiety.       The court noted the fact that Col\u00f3n was found in\n\npossession of a ghost AR loaded with a high-capacity magazine with\n\n30 rounds of ammo, plus another magazine with the same ammo loaded\n\ninto it (though, the court noted, Col\u00f3n was charged and pled guilty\n\nonly to possession of 60 rounds of ammo).            \"[H]e liked rifles,\"\n\nthe court observed.     Concluding the parties' recommended sentences\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\fdid not reflect the seriousness of this offense, address the need\n\nfor     deterrence    and      punishment,      acknowledge        the   import     of\n\nprotecting the public, or promote respect for the law, the district\n\ncourt     pronounced      an     upwardly       variant     66-month         term   of\n\nimprisonment, plus a 3-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Col\u00f3n's      counsel       objected    to     the      above-guidelines\n\nsentence as unreasonable \"given the fact history of [Col\u00f3n]\" and\n\nthe consideration of his historical drug use as part of the\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) factors assessment (given \"there was a difference of his\n\ndrug use,\" past versus more recent).\n\n            Immediately on the heels of that part of the hearing\n\n(same lawyers, same judge, same transcript -- no break in the\n\naction) came the final revocation hearing, where Col\u00f3n's counsel\n\nnoted that his Grade B violation advisory guidelines range was 4\n\nto 10 months, then requested a lower end sentence of 4 months'\n\nimprisonment to run concurrently with the just-imposed criminal-\n\ncase sentence.       For its part, the government requested a high-end\n\n10-month sentence.\n\n            The court revoked the 2017 supervised release term and,\n\nciting    its   review      of   the    guidelines'       policy    statements      on\n\nsupervised release, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \"the seriousness of\n\n[the]    violation,\"     and     noting   Col\u00f3n    \"demonstrated         a   lack   of\n\ncommitment and respect to the supervision process, as well as a\n\ndisregard to the law, by constantly engaging in the illegal use of\n\n\n                                        - 9 -\n\fcontrolled substances,\" the court imposed a 10-month sentence to\n\nrun consecutive to the new-criminal-case sentence, followed by a\n\n5-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Col\u00f3n's counsel requested reconsideration of \"the length\n\nof the sentence\" and urged that it should run concurrently with\n\nthe new-criminal-case sentence.                 Counsel said the aggregate 76-\n\nmonth sentence was quite substantial -- particularly with this\n\nbeing    Col\u00f3n's       first    revocation.        \"Denied,\"      was    the    court's\n\nresponse.\n\n            This timely consolidated appeal followed.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n            Col\u00f3n's appeal levels a multifaceted challenge at the\n\nprocedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentences imposed\n\nby the district court.              Before we dive into any of the arguments\n\nhe makes in support of that challenge -- or any of the government's\n\nresponses thereto -- we first lay out some preliminary method-of-\n\nreview guideposts and the reviewing lens we'll be using to examine\n\nCol\u00f3n's asseverations.\n\n            It     is    axiomatic       that     our   \"review    of    a     criminal\n\ndefendant's      claims        of    sentencing    error   involves       a    two-step\n\npavane.\"    United States v. Miranda-D\u00edaz, 942 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2019).     This two-step framework is well established.                       Under it,\n\n\"we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally\n\nreasonable       and    then        determine   whether    it     is    substantively\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\freasonable.\"    United States v. Clogston, 662 F.3d 588, 590 (1st\n\nCir. 2011).    At both steps, preserved claims of error get abuse-\n\nof-discretion review, see United States v. D\u00edaz-Lugo, 963 F.3d\n\n145, 151 (1st Cir. 2020), and, as part of that review, we look at\n\nfindings of fact for clear error and scrutinize questions of law\n\nde novo, see United States v. Carrasquillo-Vilches, 33 F.4th 36,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2022).\n\n           Today, we start (and will end, as it turns out) with\n\nCol\u00f3n's procedural-reasonableness claims.        And we need train our\n\nfocus on only some of those claims, not all, to reach our outcome.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Torres-Mel\u00e9ndez, 28 F.4th 339, 340\n\n(1st Cir. 2022) (taking the same approach and nodding to the adage\n\nthat \"the 'simplest' way to handle a case is often the 'best' way\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Cruz-Ramos, 987 F.3d 27, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2021))).\n\n           Specifically, we'll take on Col\u00f3n's contentions that the\n\nsentencing court committed error:     (1) in pronouncing sentence in\n\nthe new criminal conduct case when it failed to justify and\n\nadequately explain its upwardly variant sentence, which dovetails\n\nwith what Col\u00f3n says was the court's failure to engage with the\n\nmitigating    individual   characteristic   of   Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability, which was the primary sentencing argument the defense\n\nadvanced; and (2) in erroneously finding during the revocation\n\n\n\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fsentencing that Col\u00f3n was \"constantly engaging in the illegal use\n\nof controlled substances\" \"through his supervision period.\"\n\n          We   take   these   arguments,    and   the   government's\n\nprotestations to them, in turn, applying the just-recapped abuse-\n\nof-discretion framework -- despite the government's argument that\n\nwe should don a different reviewing lens.     We'll explain briefly\n\nwhy we reject the government's request.\n\n          Pointing, for instance, to what it characterizes as\n\nCol\u00f3n's counsel's failure to object below with specificity to\n\nthings like the sentencing court's balancing of the sentencing\n\nfactors or the adequacy of the sentencing rationale, the government\n\nposits that not all of Col\u00f3n's appellate contentions were preserved\n\nfor our abuse-of-discretion review.     The government submits that\n\nwe should instead deem some arguments waived for failure to map\n\nthem onto the resulting (and demanding) plain-error rubric or, at\n\nbest, review those arguments for plain error.\n\n          \"For a defendant '[t]o preserve a claim of procedural\n\nsentencing error for appellate review, [their] objection need not\n\nbe framed with exquisite precision.'\"      United States v. Reyes-\n\nCorrea, 81 F.4th 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2023) (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting United States v. Rivera-Berr\u00edos, 968 F.3d 130, 134 (1st\n\nCir. 2020)).   \"It must, however, 'be sufficiently specific to call\n\nthe district court's attention to the asserted error.'\"          Id.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 12 -\n\f(quoting United States v. Soto-Soto, 855 F.3d 445, 448 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2017)).\n\n           Having carefully studied the sentencing transcript in\n\nits   totality,   we    conclude     it    is    contextually    clear   defense\n\ncounsel's objections sufficiently called the district court's\n\nattention to the perceived sentencing problems that now form the\n\nbasis of the appellate arguments we're about to tackle.                  Counsel\n\nurged that the new-criminal-case sentence was unreasonable given\n\nCol\u00f3n's \"fact history\" -- looking at things holistically, that\n\nobjection clearly is a callback to the comprehensive arguments and\n\nurgings   Col\u00f3n's      counsel   had      infused   into   the   hearing,    thus\n\nsufficiently encompassing and preserving the argument that the\n\ndistrict court ignored the mitigating history and characteristics\n\nand didn't adequately explain its \"above-guidelines sentence.\"\n\nAnd after the revocation sentencing, during which the district\n\ncourt referred to Col\u00f3n's \"constant[]\" use of drugs \"through his\n\nsupervision period\" in pronouncing sentence, counsel's reaction\n\nwas to protest the length of that sentence, it running consecutive\n\nto    rather   than     concurrent        with   the   other     sentence,   the\n\nsubstantiality of the aggregate sentence, and the fact that Col\u00f3n\n\nhadn't gotten all the help he really needed during the short time\n\nhe'd been on release.       And, of course, we also know that, at the\n\nvery outset of the hearing, counsel had objected to the PSR's\n\ncharacterization of Col\u00f3n's drug use historically versus while on\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fsupervised   release;    counsel   argued    these    same   clarifications\n\nseveral times throughout the hearing.3\n\n           This is not a situation where we are faced only with a\n\nrecord that reflects a general objection to a sentence. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Ahrendt, 560 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir. 2009) (deeming an\n\nargument   on   appeal   unpreserved    because      an   appellant    \"never\n\nobjected to the particular issues\" he raised on appeal -- his\n\n\"generic objections [could not] be fairly interpreted as giving\n\nnotice to the court\" as to those specific issues).             Instead, the\n\nthematic protestations and objections here rather bleed together\n\nand certainly operated to make the district court aware of the\n\ndefense's claimed errors.    See, e.g., Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th at 10\n\n(finding \"[s]ubsumed within\" a party's objections \"the clearly\n\nimplicit charge that the district court's explanation rested on\n\nimproper   considerations\"    (quoting      United    States   v.     Serrano-\n\nBerr\u00edos, 38 F.4th 246, 250 n.1 (1st Cir. 2022))).            Requiring more\n\nof defense counsel here would be unwarranted.             What actually got\n\n\n\n\n     3 We also note that when Col\u00f3n's counsel objected to the\ndistrict court's reliance on the PSR's characterization of Col\u00f3n's\nhistory of drug use when announcing the 66-month sentence, the\ncourt remarked, \"I don't think it's a good idea for you to say\nthat I should not indicate what his past drug use has been,\" and\nindicated it might rescind its recommendation that Col\u00f3n\nparticipate in a beneficial drug treatment program if his counsel\npursued that argument further. Given the court's response, Col\u00f3n's\ncounsel cannot be faulted for deciding not to trot out the same\njust-rejected objection only minutes later at the conclusion of\nthe revocation sentencing.\n\n\n                                   - 14 -\n\fsaid is well in line with our preservation policy (basically,\n\nputting the district court on notice of the error).   See Holgu\u00edn-\n\nHern\u00e1ndez v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 762, 766 (2020) (\"The\n\nquestion is simply whether the claimed error was 'brought to the\n\ncourt's attention.'\" (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b))); Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 51(b).\n\n          Thus, on this record, abuse-of-discretion review it is.\n\nNow, we turn to the appellate contentions and the precedential\n\nlandscape against which they appear in this case.   First, the new-\n\nconduct sentence; then, the revocation sentence.\n\n                  New Criminal Conduct Sentence:\n         The Sentencing Explanation and Mitigating Factors\n\n          As we mentioned earlier, we need tackle only some of\n\nCol\u00f3n's various appellate attacks.      Namely, we review Col\u00f3n's\n\ncorrelated attacks on the adequacy of the court's explanation for\n\nits upward variance in the new criminal conduct case and its\n\nfailure to address the mitigating evidence of Col\u00f3n's intellectual\n\ndisability.4   But we'll lay out the particulars of these arguments\n\n\n\n\n     4 We note right off the bat that, \"[g]enerally speaking, it\nis not abundantly clear whether failure to consider mitigating\nfactors goes to the procedural or substantive reasonableness of a\nsentence.\" United States v. Santiago-Lozada, 75 F.4th 285, 295\nn.11 (1st Cir. 2023). And \"[t]he lack of an adequate explanation\ncan be characterized as either a procedural error or a challenge\nto the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\" United States\nv. Crespo-Rios, 787 F.3d 34, 37 n.3 (1st Cir. 2015). Col\u00f3n focuses\nthese arguments on procedural error, and we follow suit.\n\n\n                               - 15 -\n\fafter   we    provide    a   sampling       of   the   wide      world    of   pertinent\n\nsentencing considerations that animates our coming analysis.\n\n                                      The Primer\n\n              When it comes to what a court must do when pronouncing\n\nsentence, our jurisprudence has seen quite the evolution.                              See\n\nUnited States v. Flores-Gonz\u00e1lez, 86 F.4th 399, 417-25 (1st Cir.\n\n2023) (Thompson, J., joined by Barron, C.J. and Montecalvo J., for\n\na divided en banc court) (tracking and studying in detail the\n\nhistory      and    progression       of   federal     sentencing        precedent     and\n\nparameters).         Specific to the adequacy of a court's explanation\n\ngrounding a variance from the guidelines range, here are the\n\nbasics.\n\n              Federal law requires a sentencer to \"state in open court\n\nthe reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\"                             18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); see also Gall v.

Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th 48, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2021).\n\n          We do not require sentencing courts to deliver a \"rote\n\nincantation\" of each factor, and we do not expect them to apply\n\nequal weighting across factors.       See United States v. Dixon, 449\n\nF.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).         We likewise do not require a\n\nsentencing court to \"address every argument that a defendant\n\nadvances in support of his preferred sentence.\"         United States v.\n\nRivera-Morales, 961 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2020).        When a sentencing\n\ncourt explicitly notes that it considered all the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\nfactors, we will take that into consideration.         Clogston, 662 F.3d\n\nat 592 (observing that when a district court says it considered\n\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \"[s]uch a statement 'is entitled to some\n\nweight'\" (quoting United States v.

And, when it isn't readily apparent in as\n\nmany words, we sometimes are able to infer that a sentencing court\n\nweighed relevant factors in explaining its pronouncement.           United\n\nStates v. Flores-Nater, 62 F.4th 652, 656 (1st Cir. 2023) (\"[W]e\n\nhave not mandated that a sentencing court follow any particular\n\nformat in explaining an upwardly variant sentence.          It is enough\n\nif the explanation can be gleaned 'by fair inference' from the\n\nsentencing     record.\"   (citation   and   internal    quotation   marks\n\nomitted)); see also United States v. Montero-Montero, 817 F.3d 35,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 2016).       We resist arguments that are nothing more\n\n\n                                 - 18 -\n\fthan attempts to \"substitute [a defendant's] judgment for that of\n\nthe sentencing court.\"      United States v. Cahill, 85 F.4th 616, 625\n\n(1st Cir. 2023) (quoting Clogston, 662 F.3d at 593); United States\n\nv. Ruperto-Rivera, 16 F.4th 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2021).\n\n           With this legal backdrop in place, we move on.\n\n                              The Arguments\n\n           As we've previewed, Col\u00f3n's attack on the reasonableness\n\nof the court's pronounced sentence for his new conduct goes like\n\nthis:     The court erred by failing to consider or address the\n\nmitigating   impact   of    his   intellectual    disability   and,   quite\n\nrelatedly, the court did not provide an adequate explanation for\n\nthe upward variance.       Col\u00f3n all along has presented one principal\n\nmitigating characteristic argument -- his intellectual disability\n\nmitigates his culpability for his new criminal conduct (and the\n\nsupervised release violations) in that, for example, it made him\n\nsusceptible to being pulled into the criminal activities and\n\nconspiracies in which he was embroiled.             He points out that,\n\ndespite    consistently     arguing   this   mitigating    characteristic\n\nthroughout the sentencing proceedings, the court did not address\n\nit at all in its sentencing decision.            While recognizing, as we\n\nhave outlined above, that a sentencing court is not required to\n\naddress every factor or every argument in making its sentencing\n\ndecision, Col\u00f3n argues that in his case, the court here cannot\n\nhave adequately explained its upwardly varying sentence when it\n\n\n                                   - 19 -\n\ffailed to even mention his disability or the well documented impact\n\nit has had on his life (remember the self-mutilation).\n\n            The government relies generally on the fact that the\n\nsentencing court enjoys wide discretion in its consideration of\n\nthe sentencing factors and chalks Col\u00f3n's argument up to being a\n\ncomplaint about how mitigating factors were weighed, pointing out\n\ntoo that the court didn't need to address every argument Col\u00f3n\n\nmade.   It submits that, because the district court was obviously\n\nvery aware of Col\u00f3n's disability (the government points, for\n\ninstance, to the district court telling the parties it had read\n\nand considered Col\u00f3n's sentencing memorandum, where his disability\n\nwas highlighted in detail), its decision simply reflects that it\n\nconsidered and rejected the defense argument that the mitigating\n\nfactor of Col\u00f3n's disability warranted a lower sentence.             The\n\ngovernment    contends     the   district   court's   explanation   was\n\nsufficient because it focused on the offense conduct and relevant\n\naggravating factors not included in the guidelines calculation to\n\nsupport the upward variance (like the loaded rifle -- a ghost gun,\n\nremember).\n\n                                 Our Take\n\n            Col\u00f3n's challenge has merit.    As we'll lay out, on this\n\nrecord, the district court's explanation was problematically thin,\n\nand   its   failure   to   consider   expressly   Col\u00f3n's   intellectual\n\ndisability as a mitigating characteristic -- not just one of many\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\fmitigating   arguments   below,    but     the   principally   highlighted\n\nargument below -- ultimately compels our conclusion that its\n\nexplanation of the upwardly variant sentence was thus inadequate.\n\n          As a refresher, the court's sentencing colloquy went\n\nlike this.   First, the court recited some basic facts about Col\u00f3n\n\nand his case (his age, offenses, history of drug use, the gun --\n\nmore on this in just a moment).            Then, it observed that Col\u00f3n\n\n\"requested a sentence of 46 months\" while the government sought \"a\n\nsentence of 57 months.\"    But it reasoned \"that neither sentence\n\nreflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the\n\nlaw, protects the public from additional crimes by Mr. Colon, nor\n\ndoes it address -- do they address the issues of deterrence and\n\npunishment.\"   And then it levied its upwardly variant sentence.\n\n          On its face, this boilerplate language is insufficiently\n\nindividualized and it is inadequate -- on its own -- to explain\n\nthe upwardly variant sentence.      See, e.g., Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th\n\nat 10-11 (collecting some recent examples of similarly inadequate\n\nboilerplate \"explanations\").        \"[I]t simply rehearses -- but,\"\n\nemphasis ours, it \"does not apply -- certain of the factors that\n\nCongress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences.\"\n\nId. at 11 (quoting Flores-Nater, 62 F.4th at 656, which in turn is\n\nciting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)).\n\n          But what else was said? This matters because, as already\n\nmentioned, we readily acknowledge that sometimes a sentence can be\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fdeemed adequately explained by drawing \"fair inference[s] from the\n\nsentencing record.\"       Id. (quoting Montero-Montero, 817 F.3d at\n\n38).   However, \"while 'a court's reasoning can often be inferred\n\nby comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the\n\npre-sentence report with what the judge did,' such inferences must\n\nbe   anchored   in    'what   the   judge    did.'\"     United    States    v.\n\nCarrasquillo-S\u00e1nchez, 9 F.4th 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.\n\n2006)); see also Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th at 55.\n\n           Having acknowledged that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\nfactors, PSR, and sentencing memoranda, and after laying out the\n\nfacts of Col\u00f3n's offenses, the court also mentioned:             Col\u00f3n's age,\n\n10th grade education, and employment info; his history of using\n\nmarijuana as well as non-prescription Percocet and Xanax; his\n\nhistory of anxiety but never getting treatment for it; that he was\n\nfound with ammunition and a loaded \"ghost AR 15-style assault rifle\n\nwith no serial number\"; and that he told probation that \"he liked\n\nrifles.\"\n\n           In addition to the idea that perhaps this list of\n\nconsiderations could help explain the sentencing rationale, there\n\nis also an argument to be made -- and the government makes it --\n\nthat the mention of the loaded ghost gun (\"difficult, if not\n\nimpossible,\"    the   court   noted,   for   law    enforcement    to   trace)\n\nexplains the court's variant sentence.             As the government tells\n\n\n                                    - 22 -\n\fit,   the   sentencing   court    identified    these      main   factors   as\n\njustification for the variance, with its rationale hinging on being\n\nvery troubled by the loaded ghost gun and extended magazine, not\n\nto mention Col\u00f3n's comment that he likes guns. In the government's\n\nview, all of this is plenty from which we could infer an adequate\n\nsentencing rationale, particularly when the extent of the variance\n\nis so slight at \"only 9 months\" of extra imprisonment.\n\n            Color us unpersuaded.        For one thing, as a general\n\nmatter, we disagree with the characterization of this upward\n\nvariance as insignificant.       See Rosales-Mireles v. United States,\n\n138 S. Ct. 1897, 1907 (2018) (Sotomayor, J.) (reasoning, in another\n\nsentencing context, that \"'[t]o a prisoner,' th[e] prospect of\n\nadditional    'time   behind     bars   is    not   some    theoretical     or\n\nmathematical concept[,]'\" and \"'any amount of actual jail time' is\n\nsignificant\" (first quoting Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474, 504\n\n(2010) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); then quoting Glover v. United\n\nStates, 531 U.S. 198, 203 (2001))).          And as a practical matter, 9\n\nmonths, which represents, for example, the length of an entire\n\nschool year or a full-term pregnancy, would readily be understood\n\nas a significant time period by any reasonable measure.\n\n            Moreover, the court's statements do not constitute an\n\napplication of the factors or an adequate explanation -- this is\n\nanother \"mere listing of the facts\" that has no \"emphasis on any\n\nparticular circumstance,\" and thus it is \"impossible to tell\" what\n\n\n                                  - 23 -\n\fthe court's rationale was for landing on this 9-month upward\n\nvariance -- 15% up from the guidelines sentencing range.       Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Mu\u00f1oz-Fontanez, 61 F.4th 212, 214 (1st Cir. 2023)\n\n(vacating a 20% upward variance there).   What we have here, once\n\nagain, is the court rehashing some basic identifying information\n\nand the facts that formed the basis of the new-conduct charge that\n\nled to the instant need for sentencing. See Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th\n\nat 11; id. at 11-12 (\"A summary of the events that preceded the\n\n[sentencing] hearing -- without more -- is an impermissible basis\n\nfor a large upward variance.\").\n\n          We need to be able to understand the reasons of the\n\ndistrict court and how it arrived at its sentencing pronouncement:\n\n\"When imposing a significant variance, a sentencing court must\n\nmake clear which specific facts of the case motivated its decision\n\nand why those facts led to its decision.\" Mu\u00f1oz-Fontanez, 61 F.4th\n\nat 215; see also Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th at 13 (\"If the court deemed\n\nthe number of revocations, Reyes's behavior, or some other aspect\n\nof the record uniquely unacceptable, it should have so stated.\").\n\nWe grant that we certainly can conceive of different ways a ghost\n\ngun being in the factual mix (when the gun possession isn't already\n\nencompassed by the guidelines) could affect sentencing.     We can\n\neven (speculatively) conceive of specific ways the ghost gun in\n\nthis case might've impacted the sentencing court's analysis.   But\n\nour point here is that we do not know which reasons -- if any --\n\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fwere       actually   what   the    sentencing     court     had    in    mind   when\n\npronouncing sentence.        The point, indeed, is that the court didn't\n\nsay.       See Gall, 552 U.S. at 50 (instructing that sentencing courts\n\nmust offer \"adequate[]\" explanations \"to allow for meaningful\n\nappellate       review   and       to   promote    the     perception      of    fair\n\nsentencing\").\n\n               Now, it is not sufficiently clear to us that the court's\n\nmention of the ghost gun connects the necessary inferential dots\n\nto reveal a strong justification for the variance.                       But even if\n\nenough \"fair inferences\" could carry the day here to divine a\n\nghost-gun-anchored       justification      that     would   pass    muster,5     see\n\nFlores-Nater, 62 F.4th at 656 (noting that it is sometimes possible\n\nfor us to draw inferences from the sentencing record in concluding\n\nthat a district court adequately explained a variance), another\n\nproblem with the court's sentencing explanation looms: its failure\n\nto mention, let alone engage with, Col\u00f3n's intellectual disability\n\nas a mitigating characteristic.             The conspicuous absence of any\n\nmention of that characteristic smacks of a failure to make an\n\nindividualized assessment of Col\u00f3n.               We explain.\n\n\n\n\n       Given where we land analytically today, we need not and do\n       5\n\nnot make any per-se judgment as to the impact possession of a ghost\ngun ought to have on a sentencing calculus. As always when it\ncomes to fashioning a sentence, the role of any given fact -- ghost\ngun or otherwise -- in any given sentencing record should be\ncarefully assessed individual case by individual case.\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\f            Some   distinctions   are   helpful   as    a    starting   point.\n\nCol\u00f3n's case is not one in which the district court quite clearly\n\naddressed certain things, but an appellant nonetheless complains\n\nit did not, see, e.g., Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 9 F.4th at 52 (rejecting a\n\ndefendant's argument that the court failed to consider mitigating\n\nfactors of his youth and prior clean record when the court had\n\nexpressly    mentioned    both),6     and    (despite       the   government's\n\nsuggestion to the contrary) it is similarly unlike the related\n\nclass of cases where a defendant attempts to superimpose his own\n\npreferred weighing of the sentencing factors, see, e.g., Ruperto-\n\nRivera, 16 F.4th at 6 (rejecting a mitigating-factors challenge\n\nwhen the appellant's \"plaint boil[ed] down to a lament that the\n\ncourt did not weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors as\n\ncounsel would have preferred\").         Col\u00f3n's case is likewise unlike\n\nthose where a defendant trains his gaze on a sentencing court's\n\nfailure to address one of his arguments -- when our caselaw is\n\nclear that, in fact, it need not \"address every argument that a\n\ndefendant advances in support of his preferred sentence.\"               Rivera-\n\nMorales, 961 F.3d at 19 (emphasis added).\n\n\n     6 Additional examples for the curious reader:      Cahill, 85\nF.4th at 625 (rebuffing a defendant's claim of error as to the\ndistrict court's dismissal of multiple mitigating factors he'd\nargued when the court \"expressly consider[ed] those factors\"); and\nRuperto-Rivera, 16 F.4th at 6 (finding a court \"dealt explicitly\nwith\" a rehabilitation mitigation argument and therefore rejecting\na defendant's accusation that the court had disregarded that\nmitigating factor).\n\n\n                                    - 26 -\n\f           Col\u00f3n's case stands apart from these types of appeals\n\nfor the simple reason that he isn't complaining about how a bunch\n\nof important mitigating factors were discarded or weighed wrong;\n\nhe isn't arguing that some of his arguments were given short shrift\n\nor misunderstood.     His position is that the mitigating individual\n\ncharacteristic and the argument about it were completely ignored.\n\nAnd on this record, he has a point.\n\n           True, the district court here stated that it considered\n\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors.     And while we give \"some weight\" to that\n\nstatement, D\u00e1vila-Gonz\u00e1lez, 595 F.3d at 49 (citing United States\n\nv. Morales-Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 26 (1st Cir. 2008)), we still\n\nmust decide whether the court applied the factors reasonably.\n\n           We conclude the court fell short in this regard.           This\n\nis because it is nose-to-face plain from the record that the\n\ndistrict court never engaged with Col\u00f3n's intellectual disability\n\nas   a   mitigating   characteristic.        Col\u00f3n's    steadfast   theory\n\nthroughout the sentencing proceedings was that his intellectual\n\ndisability    affects    sentencing     at   many      levels,   including\n\nculpability, deterrence, and recidivism -- counsel all but jumped\n\nup and down to call attention to all of this.          Yes, we are mindful\n\nthat the court didn't need to address every argument raised, nor\n\ndid it need to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in any particular way.\n\nBut \"[t]he relative weight of each factor will vary with the\n\nidiosyncratic circumstances of each case,\" Dixon, 449 F.3d at 205,\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fand on this record, given Col\u00f3n's paramount emphasis on this\n\nindividual           characteristic      as     the   mitigation    argument,   it    is\n\nreasonable to conclude that the sentencing court should have\n\nengaged with it, see, e.g., Rita, 551 U.S. at 357 (teaching that\n\nwhen       a    party      \"presents    nonfrivolous     reasons     for   imposing   a\n\ndifferent sentence,\" sentencing courts should \"explain why [the\n\ncourt          is]   reject[ing]       those    arguments\"    --    \"[s]ometimes     the\n\ncircumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they\n\nwill       call      for    a   lengthier       explanation,\"      but   \"[w]here    the\n\n[sentencing court] imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines, the\n\n[court] will explain why [it] has done so\" (emphasis added)).                        See\n\nalso United States v. Robles-Alvarez, 874 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2017)          (deeming     a   sentence       unreasonable     when,    \"despite    the\n\nappellant's repeated attempts\" to get the sentencing court to\n\nconsider a \"potentially forceful [sentencing] argument,\" the court\n\n\"fail[ed] to even mention the [sentencing] issue\" and \"did not\n\neven provide a cursory explanation for its rejection of his\n\nargument\").7\n\n\n\n       In a footnote, the government tells us Robles-Alvarez is\n       7\n\nneither here nor there because the facts there were unique since\nthe appellant was sentenced to life in prison while his\ncoconspirators received significantly lesser sentences, 874 F.3d\nat 52, and \"Col\u00f3n's case does not fit within [this] unique\nframework.\"   All sentencing cases' facts are unique -- that is\nprecisely the point of our sentencing jurisprudence that requires\nindividualized assessment of each and every defendant to be\nsentenced. That said, and as Col\u00f3n points out, we see quite a few\npertinent similarities between Robles-Alvarez and the instant\n\n\n                                            - 28 -\n\f          As for possible inferences here, we run headlong into\n\nthe issue we canvassed above -- the court did not say enough from\n\nwhich we could fairly infer how it felt about Col\u00f3n's dominant\n\nmitigation argument.    The government argues the district court\n\n\"acknowledged\" the argument by noting that it had reviewed the\n\nPSR, sentencing memos, and expert report that raised the mitigating\n\ncharacteristic.   But on this record, it is simply a bridge too far\n\nfor us to say the district court meaningfully considered, let alone\n\nadequately   explained,     how   Col\u00f3n's    specific   individual\n\ncircumstances impacted the final sentencing decision.    Rita, 551\n\nU.S. at 356 (instructing that sentencing courts must say enough to\n\nshow an appellate court they \"considered the parties' arguments\").\n\nSame goes for how the ghost gun fits into any of this, i.e.,\n\nwhether the court's recitation of information about the ghost gun\n\ncould suggest the court determined that fact and its attendant\n\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating characteristic of Col\u00f3n's\n\ndisability -- the court did not say, and there is insufficient\n\nrecord material to permit such an inferential leap.\n\n\n\n\nmatter (both defense sentencing memos focused on a mitigating\nfactor to argue for a lower sentence, that argument was a primary\nfocus at the sentencing hearing, and the sentencing court said\nnothing about the argument when pronouncing sentence). Id. The\nfact that the substance of the ignored \"potentially forceful\"\nargument might differ from case to case does not alter our\nreasoning today.\n\n\n                              - 29 -\n\f           Here's where all of this leaves us:          The district court\n\nabused its discretion as it relates to the sentencing imperatives\n\nof individualized review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the adequacy\n\nof the explanation for its upwardly variant sentence.\n\n      Revocation Sentence: \"[C]onstantly engaging\" in drug use\n                  \"through his supervision period\"\n\n           Our remaining task is to examine Col\u00f3n's contention that\n\nthe   district   court   erroneously       found   during   the    revocation\n\nsentencing   that,   \"through    his   supervision    period,\"      Col\u00f3n   was\n\n\"constantly engaging in the illegal use of controlled substances.\"\n\nAccording to Col\u00f3n, this finding is clearly erroneous -- recall\n\nfrom many pages ago that the record reflects that Col\u00f3n tested\n\nnegative   for   cannabinoids    fifteen     times   during   his    release,\n\notherwise testing positive only twice (in December 2019 and June\n\n2020, and for cannabinoids only) in the 14-month testing window.\n\nCol\u00f3n notes that the PSR certainly (and misleadingly, he says)\n\ndelved into his historical and more consistent abuse of harder\n\ndrugs, but that prior use in no way reflected Col\u00f3n's behavior\n\nduring his supervised release period.          Col\u00f3n also points out that\n\nat the sentencing hearing the government may have further muddied\n\nthe waters by using the present tense to describe his prior drug\n\nuse   --   stating   that   he   \"smokes    approximately     25    marijuana\n\ncigarettes per day . . . as well as taking Xanax, Percocet, and\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 30 -\n\fKlonopins on a daily basis\" and that he \"mixes the prescription\n\ndrugs and . . . marijuana with . . . alcohol.\"\n\n           The government's rebuttal is that the record supports a\n\nconclusion that the district court was well aware Col\u00f3n had only\n\ntwo positive tests, but also knew Col\u00f3n missed a drug test and\n\npurported synthetic marijuana and rolling paper were found in his\n\ncar when he was arrested.      The court had before it the PSR and\n\ndefense counsel's many arguments about it.            So, the government\n\nsays, the district court fully appreciated the evidence of Col\u00f3n's\n\ndrug use during his supervised release, and its statement about\n\n\"constant[]\" use \"is best characterized as an inartful slip of the\n\ntongue.\"\n\n           \"[S]electing   a   sentence   based   on   clearly   erroneous\n\nfacts\" is an example of a \"significant procedural error,\" United\n\nStates v.

The record evidence shows the only time\n\nCol\u00f3n \"constantly\"8 used drugs was years earlier (back when he\n\nsmoked 25 joints a day and took Xanax, Percocet, and Klonopin\n\n\n      8\"Constantly\" is defined as \"without variation, deviation,\nor change\" and \"with regular occurrence.\"     Constantly, Merriam-\nWebster      Online       Dictionary      (Jan.      5,      2024)\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constantly\n[https://perma.cc/T6XX-METW]; see also Constantly, Oxford English\nDictionary          Online         (Jan.          5,         2024)\nhttps://www.oed.com/dictionary/constantly_adv?tab=meaning_and_us\ne&tl=true#8389233      [https://perma.cc/E7NX-T3LM]      (defining\n\"constantly\" as \"[i]nvariably, uniformly, regularly, in every\ncase, always\"; \"[c]ontinually, perpetually, incessantly, always\").\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\fdaily, sometimes even mixing prescription drugs with alcohol).\n\nThe government does not dispute this; it just insists the district\n\ncourt was well aware that Col\u00f3n's past use was just that -- past\n\n-- because the court indicated that it had read Col\u00f3n's objections\n\nto the PSR and Col\u00f3n's counsel labored to clarify the PSR's\n\nfreewheeling narrative of Col\u00f3n's drug use.               This would be a\n\nreasonable reading of things but for what the court actually said\n\nwhen imposing the revocation sentence.         The court quite clearly\n\nstated (emphases are ours) that Col\u00f3n's drug use \"through his\n\nsupervision period\" was \"constant[].\"         We cannot reconcile that\n\ncharacterization with what the record actually reflects, nor are\n\nwe willing to chalk it up to \"an inartful slip of the tongue\" as\n\nthe government suggests we should.\n\n            To the extent the district court was drawing inferences\n\nto find the drug use during Col\u00f3n's term of supervised release was\n\nconstant, that approach meets the same clear-error fate.                  A\n\n\"constantly\" using inference is wholly implausible on this record\n\nbecause there are no adequately supported facts to permit it.\n\nInstead, what the record clearly reflects is that fifteen of\n\nseventeen   tests   came   back   negative,   the   two    positives   (for\n\ncannabinoids only, remember) were 6 months apart, Col\u00f3n had been\n\nengaged in his drug treatment program, and the presumptive pot\n\nfound in Col\u00f3n's car was never even tested.                 These are not\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\f\"constantly\" using facts, nor do they even approach a set of facts\n\nthat would permit such an inference.\n\n            And so, either reading of the district court's finding\n\nwould yield the same clear-error conclusion for us.\n\n            Resisting this conclusion and trying to show us any\n\nmistake    in   this     regard   didn't   affect   Col\u00f3n's       sentence,     the\n\ngovernment reasons that the court's reliance on the drug tests\n\nwasn't an instance of the proverbial tail wagging the dog since\n\nthe tests were just one of several violations the court relied on\n\nwhen imposing sentence.           True enough, the court had before it\n\nevidence of Col\u00f3n's other violations.           But on this record, we do\n\nnot know precisely to what degree the court relied on its erroneous\n\nconstant-use fact, whether based on a misunderstanding of the\n\nrecord or extrapolated from the record, in fashioning the resulting\n\nsentence.       See,     e.g.,    Navarro-Santisteban,       83    F.4th   at    56\n\n(remanding when it was not possible to \"extricate the influence\"\n\nof the court's erroneous reliance on tainted hearsay evidence \"from\n\nthe   court's   broader     sentencing     rationale\").       We    thus   cannot\n\nconclude    that   the    procedural    error   here   did    not    affect     the\n\nselection of the imposed sentence.9\n\n\n\n\n      9Before we go, a quick word on the Bureau of Prisons' 500-\nhour drug and alcohol treatment program, which was recommended by\nthe court as part of Col\u00f3n's sentence. The government suggests\nthe court mentioned these past-drug-use facts so Col\u00f3n could\nbenefit from the 500-hour program.    This doesn't track for the\n\n\n                                     - 34 -\n\f                            CONCLUSION\n\n            We vacate Col\u00f3n's sentence and remand to the district\n\ncourt for resentencing consistent with this opinion.   In light of\n\nthis disposition, we leave untouched and intimate no view on\n\nCol\u00f3n's other appellate challenges to his sentences.   On remand,\n\nthe parties may pursue the other issues raised in their briefs we\n\nneed not reach today, to the extent those other issues remain\n\nrelevant.\n\n            The Clerk of the District Court is directed to assign\n\nthis case to a different judge on remand for prompt resentencing.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; see also United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1995) (remanding to a different judge where the\n\noriginal sentence was grounded on unsupported findings of fact);\n\n\n\n\nrevocation sentence rationale. For one thing, the court mentioned\nthe 500-hour treatment program much earlier in the sentencing --\nfor the new conduct, not as part of the revocation sentence\nrationale. For another, the court could've referred Col\u00f3n to the\n500-hour program without stating he \"constantly\" used drugs during\nhis supervision period -- or it could have been more clear that it\nwas saying so for the purpose of anchoring the order for the\ntreatment program (though again, this still doesn't square with\ncharacterizing Col\u00f3n's prior use as \"constant[]\" use \"through his\nsupervision period\"). What's more, the record bears out that the\ntreatment program may have been ordered because the defense imbued\nits sentencing arguments with the importance of substance abuse\ntreatment (of note, defense counsel below suggested Col\u00f3n might\nnot qualify specifically for the 500-hour program because it\nrequires a GED (which Col\u00f3n does not have); and even then, we note\nthere is no guarantee the Bureau of Prisons will be able to\naccommodate such a referral).\n     All to say, this point does not move the analytical needle\nfor us.\n\n\n                              - 35 -\n\fMawson v.

When authorities picked up\n\nLuis \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n-Cordero (Col\u00f3n) for violating some terms of his\n\nsupervised release, they found evidence of other violations as\n\nwell as evidence of new criminal conduct.       And so, another in a\n\nlong line of examples of folks slipping into a criminal-justice-\n\nsystem spin cycle, Col\u00f3n found himself back in court for sentencing\n\nhearings regarding the new criminal case against him and revocation\n\nof his supervised release.     The parties agreed to request within-\n\nguidelines sentences, but the district court, not bound by the\n\nparties&#x27; recommendations, imposed an upwardly variant sentence of\n\nimprisonment for the new criminal conduct and a tip-top-of-the-\n\nguidelines-range term of imprisonment for violating his supervised\n\nrelease, with those sentences to run consecutively.       On appeal,\n\nCol\u00f3n raises a number of arguments challenging the pronounced\n\nsentences as unreasonable.     For reasons we&#x27;ll explain, we vacate\n\nand remand for resentencing.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          We begin with the relevant facts and travel, providing\n\nthe bulk of the particulars now (bear with us) with plans to add\n\nsome more detail later as needed.

Some examples:    a school\n\nreferral prompted him to see a mental health specialist when he\n\nwas 15; he heated a car antenna, then used it to burn his forehead\n\nand under his eyes; he has used cigarettes to burn his forearms\n\nand blades to cut himself; and he has visible scars from his self-\n\ninflicted burning and cutting.      And, as of his 2017 plea, a then-\n\n25-year-old Col\u00f3n had a history of substance abuse, including\n\nsmoking marijuana (25 joints a day) since he was 18, and, at the\n\nsame age, developing a use of non-prescription Xanax, Percocet,\n\nand Klonopin (one or two pills daily), plus occasionally mixing\n\nsome of this drug use with alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 3 -\n\f            And so, as part of his August 2019 supervised release,\n\nCol\u00f3n was referred to substance abuse and mental health treatment.\n\nThe mental health treatment to which Col\u00f3n was later referred in\n\nJanuary 2020 screeched to a halt with the advent of the global\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its resulting lockdowns, but Col\u00f3n continued\n\nhis substance abuse treatment, which he reported he liked going to\n\nand found helpful.    For 14 months during his supervised release\n\nterm (up until he was arrested, anyway), Col\u00f3n tested positive to\n\ncannabinoids two times out of seventeen tests (more on this later)\n\nand failed to report to the drug-testing program once.\n\n            Aside from those two positive drug tests, which were\n\nviolations in and of themselves pursuant to the terms of his\n\nrelease, Col\u00f3n violated another supervised release condition when\n\nhe failed to stay at his address of record (his mother&#x27;s house).\n\nAfter being called out for moving out, Col\u00f3n returned to his mom&#x27;s\n\nplace, but he didn&#x27;t stay put long:     Two days later, probation\n\nreported, he&#x27;d again moved out without notice.       In response,\n\nprobation successfully requested an arrest warrant, and local\n\nauthorities searched the place where Col\u00f3n was thought to be\n\nresiding.    During the search, officers found under Col\u00f3n&#x27;s bed a\n\nloaded AR-style rifle with 30 rounds of ammunition along with an\n\nextra magazine loaded with an additional 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nCol\u00f3n admitted ownership of the rifle, nonchalantly observing to\n\n\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fthe officers &quot;that he liked rifles.&quot;            The search team also found\n\npresumptive synthetic marijuana1 and rolling paper in his car.\n\n            A federal grand jury indicted Col\u00f3n on a single count of\n\nviolating </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922</span><pre class=\"inline\">, which generally proscribes certain\n\ncategories of people from possessing firearms or ammunition. Col\u00f3n\n\nwaived   his    preliminary   revocation       hearing      for   the    supervised\n\nrelease violations and on the new charge pleaded guilty to being\n\na felon in possession of ammunition (60 rounds) pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement.2\n\n            The parties proposed in the plea agreement an advisory\n\nguidelines calculation that started with a base offense level of\n\n22, minus three levels for acceptance of responsibility, and\n\ndetermined a total offense level (TOL) of 19.                     And the parties\n\nalso agreed they&#x27;d each request a sentence within the to-be-tallied\n\nguidelines     range   for   the   TOL   of    19    when   combined      with   the\n\nundetermined Criminal History Category (CHC).                 The PSR landed on\n\n19 as the TOL, too, then laid out Col\u00f3n&#x27;s criminal history,\n\nincluding      his   Commonwealth-side        drug    conviction        (possessing\n\ncontrolled substances and drug paraphernalia) and the federal drug\n\nconviction     (conspiracy    to   possess     with    intent      to   distribute\n\n\n     1 The record does not reflect that this substance was ever\ntested and confirmed to be synthetic marijuana.\n     2 The parties agree the agreement&#x27;s waiver-of-appeal provision\n\ndoes not operate as a bar to this appeal since the provision was\nconditioned on the district court sentencing Col\u00f3n to a term of 46\nmonths&#x27; imprisonment or less -- which condition is not met here.\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fnarcotics).    These tabulations dictated a CHC of IV, and, together\n\nwith the TOL of 19, yielded a guidelines sentencing range of 46 to\n\n57 months&#x27; imprisonment.\n\n            Each side then filed a sentencing memorandum in support\n\nof its recommended sentence (a low-end 46 months from Col\u00f3n; a\n\nhigh-end 57 months from the government) in anticipation of the\n\nupcoming hearings.\n\n                           The Sentencing Hearings\n\n            Before the district court in February 2022, the first\n\nsentencing matter taken up was Col\u00f3n&#x27;s new criminal case (the\n\nammunition-possession indictment).          Counsel for Col\u00f3n started with\n\nsome objections to the PSR, two of which are relevant to today&#x27;s\n\nanalysis.     First, counsel argued the district court should append\n\nto the PSR a psychometric evaluation filed by the expert who&#x27;d\n\nexamined Col\u00f3n at defense counsel&#x27;s request and assessed his\n\nintellectual disability; the district court agreed to do so.              That\n\nmatter squared away, counsel next argued that because the PSR&#x27;s\n\ndrug-use section described Col\u00f3n&#x27;s historically heavier use of\n\nsubstances,    the   PSR    impermissibly    suggested   that,   during    his\n\nrelease period, Col\u00f3n had been using more than just the marijuana\n\nto which he&#x27;d twice tested positive.              The court signaled in\n\nresponse that it would consider these points in sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\f            Moving to her argument proper, Col\u00f3n&#x27;s counsel offered\n\nthe following in support of the recommended low-end 46-month\n\nsentence.\n\n            Stating what those in the sentencing world should take\n\nas a given, counsel set the stage by pointing out that the\n\nsentencing court must &quot;make[] an individualized assessment . . .\n\nof Col\u00f3n&quot; when pronouncing sentence.            To that end, counsel urged\n\nCol\u00f3n&#x27;s offense was not a violent one -- it was possession only,\n\nand   his   offense   could    be   explained    by    Col\u00f3n&#x27;s   intellectual\n\ndisability, which was a big part of why, counsel explained, &quot;the\n\ncards have always been stacked against&quot; Col\u00f3n.                That disability\n\nrendered Col\u00f3n -- who has an IQ equivalent to a third-grade\n\neducation, is especially susceptible to peer pressure, and cannot\n\nread or write -- unable to appreciate the amount of ammunition\n\nloaded into the magazines, and his disability also prompted his\n\ncomment that he likes guns.          Drawing on all of this and more,\n\ncounsel beseeched the court to balance this information against\n\nthe need to deter and promote respect for the law when crafting an\n\nindividualized sentence of imprisonment for his non-violent crime.\n\n            The government, on the other hand, sought a 57-month\n\nterm of imprisonment plus a term of supervised release.

And, in the government&#x27;s telling, Col\u00f3n didn&#x27;t have\n\na history of seeking mental health treatment, instead opting to\n\n&quot;channel[]&quot; his anxiety and anger into &quot;destructive&quot; activities.\n\n              Citing its review of the </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a) factors,\n\nPSR, sentencing memoranda, and a document the court construed as\n\nCol\u00f3n&#x27;s allocution, the court turned to its own take on sentencing.\n\nThe   court    listed   then-30-year-old   Col\u00f3n&#x27;s    &quot;history   of   using\n\nmarijuana and Percocet and Xanax pills without prescriptions,&quot; and\n\nthat he &quot;has never received treatment&quot; for his complained-of\n\nanxiety.       The court noted the fact that Col\u00f3n was found in\n\npossession of a ghost AR loaded with a high-capacity magazine with\n\n30 rounds of ammo, plus another magazine with the same ammo loaded\n\ninto it (though, the court noted, Col\u00f3n was charged and pled guilty\n\nonly to possession of 60 rounds of ammo).            &quot;[H]e liked rifles,&quot;\n\nthe court observed.

For its part, the government requested a high-end\n\n10-month sentence.\n\n            The court revoked the 2017 supervised release term and,\n\nciting    its   review      of   the    guidelines&#x27;       policy    statements      on\n\nsupervised release, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and &quot;the seriousness of\n\n[the]    violation,&quot;     and     noting   Col\u00f3n    &quot;demonstrated         a   lack   of\n\ncommitment and respect to the supervision process, as well as a\n\ndisregard to the law, by constantly engaging in the illegal use of\n\n\n                                        - 9 -\n\fcontrolled substances,&quot; the court imposed a 10-month sentence to\n\nrun consecutive to the new-criminal-case sentence, followed by a\n\n5-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Col\u00f3n&#x27;s counsel requested reconsideration of &quot;the length\n\nof the sentence&quot; and urged that it should run concurrently with\n\nthe new-criminal-case sentence.                 Counsel said the aggregate 76-\n\nmonth sentence was quite substantial -- particularly with this\n\nbeing    Col\u00f3n&#x27;s       first    revocation.        &quot;Denied,&quot;      was    the    court&#x27;s\n\nresponse.\n\n            This timely consolidated appeal followed.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n            Col\u00f3n&#x27;s appeal levels a multifaceted challenge at the\n\nprocedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentences imposed\n\nby the district court.              Before we dive into any of the arguments\n\nhe makes in support of that challenge -- or any of the government&#x27;s\n\nresponses thereto -- we first lay out some preliminary method-of-\n\nreview guideposts and the reviewing lens we&#x27;ll be using to examine\n\nCol\u00f3n&#x27;s asseverations.\n\n            It     is    axiomatic       that     our   &quot;review    of    a     criminal\n\ndefendant&#x27;s      claims        of    sentencing    error   involves       a    two-step\n\npavane.&quot;    United States v.

Counsel\n\nurged that the new-criminal-case sentence was unreasonable given\n\nCol\u00f3n&#x27;s &quot;fact history&quot; -- looking at things holistically, that\n\nobjection clearly is a callback to the comprehensive arguments and\n\nurgings   Col\u00f3n&#x27;s      counsel   had      infused   into   the   hearing,    thus\n\nsufficiently encompassing and preserving the argument that the\n\ndistrict court ignored the mitigating history and characteristics\n\nand didn&#x27;t adequately explain its &quot;above-guidelines sentence.&quot;\n\nAnd after the revocation sentencing, during which the district\n\ncourt referred to Col\u00f3n&#x27;s &quot;constant[]&quot; use of drugs &quot;through his\n\nsupervision period&quot; in pronouncing sentence, counsel&#x27;s reaction\n\nwas to protest the length of that sentence, it running consecutive\n\nto    rather   than     concurrent        with   the   other     sentence,   the\n\nsubstantiality of the aggregate sentence, and the fact that Col\u00f3n\n\nhadn&#x27;t gotten all the help he really needed during the short time\n\nhe&#x27;d been on release.       And, of course, we also know that, at the\n\nvery outset of the hearing, counsel had objected to the PSR&#x27;s\n\ncharacterization of Col\u00f3n&#x27;s drug use historically versus while on\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fsupervised   release;    counsel   argued    these    same   clarifications\n\nseveral times throughout the hearing.3\n\n           This is not a situation where we are faced only with a\n\nrecord that reflects a general objection to a sentence.

Col\u00f3n all along has presented one principal\n\nmitigating characteristic argument -- his intellectual disability\n\nmitigates his culpability for his new criminal conduct (and the\n\nsupervised release violations) in that, for example, it made him\n\nsusceptible to being pulled into the criminal activities and\n\nconspiracies in which he was embroiled.             He points out that,\n\ndespite    consistently     arguing   this   mitigating    characteristic\n\nthroughout the sentencing proceedings, the court did not address\n\nit at all in its sentencing decision.            While recognizing, as we\n\nhave outlined above, that a sentencing court is not required to\n\naddress every factor or every argument in making its sentencing\n\ndecision, Col\u00f3n argues that in his case, the court here cannot\n\nhave adequately explained its upwardly varying sentence when it\n\n\n                                   - 19 -\n\ffailed to even mention his disability or the well documented impact\n\nit has had on his life (remember the self-mutilation).\n\n            The government relies generally on the fact that the\n\nsentencing court enjoys wide discretion in its consideration of\n\nthe sentencing factors and chalks Col\u00f3n&#x27;s argument up to being a\n\ncomplaint about how mitigating factors were weighed, pointing out\n\ntoo that the court didn&#x27;t need to address every argument Col\u00f3n\n\nmade.   It submits that, because the district court was obviously\n\nvery aware of Col\u00f3n&#x27;s disability (the government points, for\n\ninstance, to the district court telling the parties it had read\n\nand considered Col\u00f3n&#x27;s sentencing memorandum, where his disability\n\nwas highlighted in detail), its decision simply reflects that it\n\nconsidered and rejected the defense argument that the mitigating\n\nfactor of Col\u00f3n&#x27;s disability warranted a lower sentence.             The\n\ngovernment    contends     the   district   court&#x27;s   explanation   was\n\nsufficient because it focused on the offense conduct and relevant\n\naggravating factors not included in the guidelines calculation to\n\nsupport the upward variance (like the loaded rifle -- a ghost gun,\n\nremember).\n\n                                 Our Take\n\n            Col\u00f3n&#x27;s challenge has merit.    As we&#x27;ll lay out, on this\n\nrecord, the district court&#x27;s explanation was problematically thin,\n\nand   its   failure   to   consider   expressly   Col\u00f3n&#x27;s   intellectual\n\ndisability as a mitigating characteristic -- not just one of many\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\fmitigating   arguments   below,    but     the   principally   highlighted\n\nargument below -- ultimately compels our conclusion that its\n\nexplanation of the upwardly variant sentence was thus inadequate.\n\n          As a refresher, the court&#x27;s sentencing colloquy went\n\nlike this.   First, the court recited some basic facts about Col\u00f3n\n\nand his case (his age, offenses, history of drug use, the gun --\n\nmore on this in just a moment).            Then, it observed that Col\u00f3n\n\n&quot;requested a sentence of 46 months&quot; while the government sought &quot;a\n\nsentence of 57 months.&quot;    But it reasoned &quot;that neither sentence\n\nreflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the\n\nlaw, protects the public from additional crimes by Mr. Colon, nor\n\ndoes it address -- do they address the issues of deterrence and\n\npunishment.&quot;   And then it levied its upwardly variant sentence.\n\n          On its face, this boilerplate language is insufficiently\n\nindividualized and it is inadequate -- on its own -- to explain\n\nthe upwardly variant sentence.      See, e.g., Reyes-Correa, 81 F.4th\n\nat 10-11 (collecting some recent examples of similarly inadequate\n\nboilerplate &quot;explanations&quot;).        &quot;[I]t simply rehearses -- but,&quot;\n\nemphasis ours, it &quot;does not apply -- certain of the factors that\n\nCongress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences.&quot;\n\nId. at 11 (quoting Flores-Nater, 62 F.4th at 656, which in turn is\n\nciting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)).\n\n          But what else was said?

We can\n\neven (speculatively) conceive of specific ways the ghost gun in\n\nthis case might&#x27;ve impacted the sentencing court&#x27;s analysis.

Col\u00f3n also points out that\n\nat the sentencing hearing the government may have further muddied\n\nthe waters by using the present tense to describe his prior drug\n\nuse   --   stating   that   he   &quot;smokes    approximately     25    marijuana\n\ncigarettes per day . . . as well as taking Xanax, Percocet, and\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 30 -\n\fKlonopins on a daily basis&quot; and that he &quot;mixes the prescription\n\ndrugs and . . . marijuana with . . . alcohol.&quot;\n\n           The government&#x27;s rebuttal is that the record supports a\n\nconclusion that the district court was well aware Col\u00f3n had only\n\ntwo positive tests, but also knew Col\u00f3n missed a drug test and\n\npurported synthetic marijuana and rolling paper were found in his\n\ncar when he was arrested.

This would be a\n\nreasonable reading of things but for what the court actually said\n\nwhen imposing the revocation sentence.         The court quite clearly\n\nstated (emphases are ours) that Col\u00f3n&#x27;s drug use &quot;through his\n\nsupervision period&quot; was &quot;constant[].&quot;         We cannot reconcile that\n\ncharacterization with what the record actually reflects, nor are\n\nwe willing to chalk it up to &quot;an inartful slip of the tongue&quot; as\n\nthe government suggests we should.\n\n            To the extent the district court was drawing inferences\n\nto find the drug use during Col\u00f3n&#x27;s term of supervised release was\n\nconstant, that approach meets the same clear-error fate.                  A\n\n&quot;constantly&quot; using inference is wholly implausible on this record\n\nbecause there are no adequately supported facts to permit it.\n\nInstead, what the record clearly reflects is that fifteen of\n\nseventeen   tests   came   back   negative,   the   two    positives   (for\n\ncannabinoids only, remember) were 6 months apart, Col\u00f3n had been\n\nengaged in his drug treatment program, and the presumptive pot\n\nfound in Col\u00f3n&#x27;s car was never even tested.                 These are not\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\f&quot;constantly&quot; using facts, nor do they even approach a set of facts\n\nthat would permit such an inference.\n\n            And so, either reading of the district court&#x27;s finding\n\nwould yield the same clear-error conclusion for us.\n\n            Resisting this conclusion and trying to show us any\n\nmistake    in   this     regard   didn&#x27;t   affect   Col\u00f3n&#x27;s       sentence,     the\n\ngovernment reasons that the court&#x27;s reliance on the drug tests\n\nwasn&#x27;t an instance of the proverbial tail wagging the dog since\n\nthe tests were just one of several violations the court relied on\n\nwhen imposing sentence.           True enough, the court had before it\n\nevidence of Col\u00f3n&#x27;s other violations.           But on this record, we do\n\nnot know precisely to what degree the court relied on its erroneous\n\nconstant-use fact, whether based on a misunderstanding of the\n\nrecord or extrapolated from the record, in fashioning the resulting\n\nsentence.       See,     e.g.,    Navarro-Santisteban,       83    F.4th   at    56\n\n(remanding when it was not possible to &quot;extricate the influence&quot;\n\nof the court&#x27;s erroneous reliance on tainted hearsay evidence &quot;from\n\nthe   court&#x27;s   broader     sentencing     rationale&quot;).       We    thus   cannot\n\nconclude    that   the    procedural    error   here   did    not    affect     the\n\nselection of the imposed sentence.9\n\n\n\n\n      9Before we go, a quick word on the Bureau of Prisons&#x27; 500-\nhour drug and alcohol treatment program, which was recommended by\nthe court as part of Col\u00f3n&#x27;s sentence.

In light of\n\nthis disposition, we leave untouched and intimate no view on\n\nCol\u00f3n&#x27;s other appellate challenges to his sentences.
