The appellate court found that the plaintiff did not comply\n\f     with the supreme court rules. 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 16. We allowed\n     plaintiff\u2019s petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 315\n     (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s\n     judgment.\n\n\n\u00b62                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On September 1, 2020, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint in Lake County\n     circuit court for eviction against defendant, Stretch\u2019s Sports Bar & Grill\n     Corporation. Count I sought possession, and count II sought a money judgment. On\n     March 1, 2021, after plaintiff presented its case at a bench trial, on defendant\u2019s\n     motion the trial court found against plaintiff and entered judgment in favor of\n     defendant. See 735 ILCS 5/2-1110 (West 2020). On March 2, 2021, the court\n     entered a written order memorializing its judgment. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal\n     on April 6, 2021.\n\n\u00b64       The appellate court first addressed its jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n     2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 7. The court determined that the final judgment date\n     was March 2, 2021, which made plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal due on or before April\n     1, 2021. Id. \u00b6 10. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was file-stamped on April 6, 2021. Id.\n     \u00b6 11. The court noted plaintiff\u2019s assertions that it had electronically submitted the\n     notice of appeal on April 1, 2021, that the clerk rejected the notice of appeal on\n     April 6, 2021, and that plaintiff resubmitted the notice of appeal on the same day.\n     Id. \u00b6 12. The court found the first two factual assertions were not supported by the\n     record. Id. Nonetheless, the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s arguments and would have\n     made the same decision even if it assumed each factual assertion were true. Id.\n\n\u00b65        The court described two potential avenues for relief where a clerk\u2019s rejection of\n     a notice of appeal renders the document untimely\u2014(1) relief can be obtained in the\n     circuit court under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022), or (2)\n     relief can be obtained in the appellate court pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule\n     303(d) (eff. July 1, 2017). 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Ultimately, the court\n     did not decide which rule was the \u201cproper vehicle to excuse a late electronic filing\n     of a notice of appeal *** because plaintiff did not seek relief under either.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16.\n     The court held that jurisdiction was lacking and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s appeal. Id.\n     \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f\u00b66         This court granted plaintiff\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a)\n       (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b67                                        II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiff again argues that its notice of appeal was filed timely because it\n       electronically submitted the notice of appeal before midnight on the due date, April\n       1, 2021. Plaintiff invokes due process concerns and argues that it should not be\n       penalized where the clerk erroneously rejected its notice of appeal. Finally, plaintiff\n       recommends that this court \u201cconsider ordering the clerks of this State discontinue\n       the process of outright rejecting motions to reconsider and notices of appeal when\n       a non-material defect is recognized in the electronic filing.\u201d For the following\n       reasons, we reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments.\n\n\n\u00b69                     A. Proceeding With Review on Plaintiff\u2019s Brief Alone\n\n\u00b6 10       Defendant did not file a brief in this court. However, our review is not hindered\n       because the record is simple and the issue is one that the court can easily decide on\n       plaintiff\u2019s brief alone. See First Capitol Mortgage Corp. v. Talandis Construction\n       Corp., 63 Ill. 2d 128, 133 (1976). Thus, following Talandis, we find support for our\n       decision to address the merits of this appeal. See McHenry Township v. County of\n       McHenry, 2022 IL 127258, \u00b6 48.\n\n\n\u00b6 11                                   B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 12       \u201cThe determination of whether the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider\n       an appeal is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d People v. Vara, 2018 IL\n       121823, \u00b6 12. The construction of our rules is also a question of law subject to\n       de novo review. People v. Casler, 2020 IL 125117, \u00b6 22.\n\n\n\u00b6 13                   C. Supreme Court Rules Governing Notices of Appeal\n\n\u00b6 14        \u201cEvery final judgment of a circuit court in a civil case is appealable as of right.\u201d\n       Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). \u201cThe appeal is initiated by filing a notice of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f       appeal.\u201d Id. \u201cNo other step is jurisdictional.\u201d Id. \u201cThe notice of appeal must be filed\n       with the clerk of the circuit court within 30 days after the entry of the final judgment\n       appealed from ***.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(a)(1) (eff. July 1, 2017). The notice of appeal\n       in a civil case \u201cshall be electronically filed with the clerk of court.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R.\n       9(a) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022). Rule 9(d) provides: \u201cUnless a statute, rule, or court order\n       requires that a document be filed by a certain time of day, a document is considered\n       timely if submitted before midnight (in the court\u2019s time zone) on or before the date\n       on which the document is due.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022).\n\n\u00b6 15       A document is untimely if it is rejected by the clerk and not timely resubmitted\n       and accepted. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022); Davis v. Village of\n       Maywood, 2020 IL App (1st) 191011, \u00b6 19 (holding that a rejected submission has\n       \u201cno effect\u201d). In that event, our rules provide two potential avenues of relief. First,\n       Rule 9(d)(2) provides that, \u201c[i]f a document is rejected by the clerk and is therefore\n       untimely, the filing party may seek appropriate relief from the court, upon good\n       cause shown.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 9(d)(2) (eff. Feb. 4, 2022). 1 The circuit court is vested\n       with \u201csound discretion\u201d in determining whether \u201cgood cause\u201d has been shown. See\n       Vision Point of Sale, Inc. v. Haas, 226 Ill. 2d 334, 353 (2007) (holding that \u201cwhat\n       constitutes good cause,\u201d in the context of a motion for extension of time, \u201cis fact-\n       dependent and rests within the sound discretion of the circuit court\u201d); see also\n       Kilpatrick v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 2023 IL App (2d) 230088, \u00b6 15 (holding\n       that a circuit court\u2019s ruling on a litigant\u2019s Rule 9(d)(2) motion is reviewed for an\n       abuse of discretion).\n\n\u00b6 16       Second, Rule 303(d) is another potential avenue for relief and permits a litigant\n       to take its case directly to the appellate court. Rule 303(d) provides that \u201cthe\n       reviewing court may grant leave to appeal\u201d on \u201cmotion supported by a showing of\n       reasonable excuse for failure to file a notice of appeal on time, accompanied by the\n\n            1\n              We note that there is disagreement in the appellate court on whether Rule 9(d)(2) can be used\n       to establish jurisdiction when a notice of appeal is not timely filed. Compare O\u2019Gara v. O\u2019Gara,\n       2022 IL App (1st) 210013, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47 (holding that a trial court could rule on a Rule 9(d)(2) motion\n       after 30 days from the entry of a final judgment, as a nunc pro tunc order, if the document was\n       electronically submitted within the 30-day limitation period), with 2022 IL App (2d) 210179, \u00b6 15\n       (noting that the \u201cprocedure to seek relief under Rule 9(d)(2) may not apply to a notice of appeal\n       because (1) a trial court loses its jurisdiction 30 days after final judgment, and (2) the rule does not\n       state that a trial court retains jurisdiction to grant such relief\u201d). We need not decide the availability\n       of relief under Rule 9(d)(2) in this case because plaintiff never sought such relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\f       proposed notice of appeal and the filing fee, filed in the reviewing court within 30\n       days after expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(d)\n       (eff. July 1, 2017). We have found \u201creasonable excuse\u201d where an attorney made an\n       \u201chonest mistake\u201d in recording the incorrect date for the final judgment and,\n       immediately upon discovering the error, \u201cmade every effort to rectify the situation.\u201d\n       Bank of Herrin v. Peoples Bank of Marion, 105 Ill. 2d 305, 308-09 (1985).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                      D. Plaintiff Failed to Comply With Our Rules\n\n\u00b6 18        It is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 6, 2021, five\n       days after it was due. It is also undisputed that plaintiff did not seek relief in the\n       circuit court under Rule 9(d)(2) or in the appellate court under Rule 303(d).\n       Nonetheless, plaintiff relies on two facts to argue that the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction: (1) that it submitted a notice of appeal electronically on April 1, 2021,\n       and (2) that the clerk erroneously rejected the notice of appeal. We find plaintiff\u2019s\n       arguments unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the record does not support either of\n       plaintiff\u2019s factual assertions. Second, under our rules, plaintiff was required to have\n       its untimely filing excused by a court.\n\n\n\u00b6 19                                   1. Incomplete Record\n\n\u00b6 20       The appellant has the burden of presenting a sufficiently complete record to\n       support a claim of error. Midstate Siding & Window Co. v. Rogers, 204 Ill. 2d 314,\n       319 (2003) (citing Foutch v. O\u2019Bryant, 99 Ill. 2d 389, 391-92 (1984)). \u201cA party\n       may generally not rely on matters outside the record to support its position on\n       appeal.\u201d Keener v. City of Herrin, 235 Ill. 2d 338, 346 (2009). If pleadings, exhibits,\n       or other materials are not in the record, they may not be placed before a reviewing\n       court in an appendix. Ill. S. Ct. R. 342 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019) (providing that the\n       appendix to an appellant\u2019s brief is limited to pleadings, exhibits, or other materials\n       \u201cfrom the record\u201d); Oruta v. B.E.W., 2016 IL App (1st) 152735, \u00b6 32 (explaining\n       that materials improperly placed in an appendix will be disregarded).\n\n\u00b6 21       The documents alleged to support plaintiff\u2019s factual assertions are not in the\n       record. Instead, they are in the appendix to its appellant\u2019s brief. Plaintiff\u2019s appendix\n       includes, inter alia, documents titled \u201cNotice of Appeal Filed April 1, 2021\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information.\u201d Plaintiff labels each document as a supplemental\n       record exhibit. The \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information\u201d consists of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, which indicates that the April 1 filing was the notice of appeal with the\n       trial court\u2019s order included as an attachment. Based on these exhibits, plaintiff\n       maintains that its April 1 filing was \u201cRejected\u201d and that the clerk\u2019s explanation was\n       that there \u201cshould not be any attachments.\u201d The clerk directed plaintiff to \u201cresubmit\n       with all pages as one lead document.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the clerk\u2019s reason for\n       rejection was \u201cin contravention of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit\u2019s specific rule\n       requiring litigants to upload documents separately and expressly forbidding filers\n       from combining multiple documents into one PDF.\u201d See 19th Judicial Cir. Ct. R.\n       1-2.08(E) (Dec. 31, 2017) (\u201cBulk filings of multiple cases or multiple documents\n       combined into one PDF document shall not be accepted.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 22       Because the documents or exhibits are only found in the appendix, the facts and\n       inferences flowing from the documents or exhibits are not within the record. The\n       documents or exhibits were also not presented to the appellate court. In short,\n       evidence of plaintiff\u2019s assertions\u2014that it timely submitted its notice of appeal\n       electronically and that the clerk erroneously rejected the electronic filing\u2014is not\n       found in the common-law record. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 321 (eff. Oct. 1, 2021)\n       (\u201cContents of the Record on Appeal\u201d\u2014\u201cThe common law record includes every\n       document filed, judgment, and order entered and any exhibit offered and filed by\n       any party.\u201d). As will be discussed more fully below, plaintiff never filed a motion\n       in either the circuit or appellate court to challenge the propriety of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, and thus, the supporting documents were never made part of the record.\n       As a result, there is no basis in the record to find that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal\n       was timely.\n\n\n\u00b6 23                   2. Plaintiff Failed to Seek Recourse for Its Untimely Filing\n\n\u00b6 24        Because plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, plaintiff was required to seek\n       relief. Plaintiff did not do so. That fact is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s claim that the appellate\n       court had jurisdiction. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on due process concerns is misplaced\n       because plaintiff did not utilize the remedies available. See Alvin v. Suzuki, 227\n       F.3d 107, 116 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[A] procedural due process violation cannot have\n       occurred when the governmental actor provides apparently adequate procedural\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f       remedies and the plaintiff has not availed himself of those remedies.\u201d). As\n       discussed above, two of our rules provide potential recourse for a litigant who has\n       an initial submission rejected by the clerk. Taking plaintiff\u2019s premise as true, that\n       the clerk erroneously applied local rules in rejecting his initial submission, one\n       would be hard-pressed to find a more compelling case of \u201cgood cause\u201d or\n       \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to allow plaintiff\u2019s appeal to proceed. However, plaintiff never\n       sought to establish that premise in either the circuit or appellate court. Because\n       plaintiff did not seek to excuse its untimely filing, it is left with the fact that its\n       notice of appeal was filed five days after the due date. The legal effect of that fact\n       is that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n\n\n\u00b6 25                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 26       Under our rules, when the clerk\u2019s rejection of a litigant\u2019s electronically filed\n       notice of appeal causes it to be untimely, the litigant must invoke the Illinois\n       Supreme Court rules to seek recourse. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely,\n       and plaintiff did not seek recourse in our rules. Accordingly, the appellate court was\n       correct that it lacked jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u00b6 27      Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 28      Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 129277</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 129277)\n\n              WAUKEGAN HOSPITALITY GROUP, LLC, Appellant, v.\n           STRETCH\u2019S SPORTS BAR &amp; GRILL CORPORATION, Appellee.\n\n\n                               Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n        JUSTICE NEVILLE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n\n        Chief Justice Theis and Justices Overstreet, Holder White, Cunningham,\n     Rochford, and O\u2019Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n\u00b61        In this case, we are asked to consider whether the appellate court had\n     jurisdiction to hear the appeal of plaintiff, Waukegan Hospitality Group, LLC,\n     where plaintiff (1) electronically filed its notice of appeal five days after it was due\n     and (2) did not file a motion seeking leave to show good cause or a reasonable\n     excuse for the late filing.

We allowed\n     plaintiff\u2019s petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 315\n     (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s\n     judgment.\n\n\n\u00b62                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On September 1, 2020, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint in Lake County\n     circuit court for eviction against defendant, Stretch\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill\n     Corporation. Count I sought possession, and count II sought a money judgment. On\n     March 1, 2021, after plaintiff presented its case at a bench trial, on defendant\u2019s\n     motion the trial court found against plaintiff and entered judgment in favor of\n     defendant. See 735 ILCS 5/2-1110 (West 2020). On March 2, 2021, the court\n     entered a written order memorializing its judgment. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal\n     on April 6, 2021.\n\n\u00b64       The appellate court first addressed its jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9322873\"><a href=\"/opinion/9327561/waukegan-hospitality-group-llc-v-stretchs-sports-bar-grill-corp/\">2022 IL App (2d) 210179</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 7. The court determined that the final judgment date\n     was March 2, 2021, which made plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal due on or before April\n     1, 2021. Id. \u00b6 10. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was file-stamped on April 6, 2021. Id.\n     \u00b6 11. The court noted plaintiff\u2019s assertions that it had electronically submitted the\n     notice of appeal on April 1, 2021, that the clerk rejected the notice of appeal on\n     April 6, 2021, and that plaintiff resubmitted the notice of appeal on the same day.\n     Id. \u00b6 12. The court found the first two factual assertions were not supported by the\n     record. Id. Nonetheless, the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s arguments and would have\n     made the same decision even if it assumed each factual assertion were true. Id.\n\n\u00b65        The court described two potential avenues for relief where a clerk\u2019s rejection of\n     a notice of appeal renders the document untimely\u2014(1) relief can be obtained in the\n     circuit court under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 9(d)(2) (eff.

ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiff again argues that its notice of appeal was filed timely because it\n       electronically submitted the notice of appeal before midnight on the due date, April\n       1, 2021. Plaintiff invokes due process concerns and argues that it should not be\n       penalized where the clerk erroneously rejected its notice of appeal. Finally, plaintiff\n       recommends that this court \u201cconsider ordering the clerks of this State discontinue\n       the process of outright rejecting motions to reconsider and notices of appeal when\n       a non-material defect is recognized in the electronic filing.\u201d For the following\n       reasons, we reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments.\n\n\n\u00b69                     A. Proceeding With Review on Plaintiff\u2019s Brief Alone\n\n\u00b6 10       Defendant did not file a brief in this court. However, our review is not hindered\n       because the record is simple and the issue is one that the court can easily decide on\n       plaintiff\u2019s brief alone.

Plaintiff Failed to Comply With Our Rules\n\n\u00b6 18        It is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 6, 2021, five\n       days after it was due. It is also undisputed that plaintiff did not seek relief in the\n       circuit court under Rule 9(d)(2) or in the appellate court under Rule 303(d).\n       Nonetheless, plaintiff relies on two facts to argue that the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction: (1) that it submitted a notice of appeal electronically on April 1, 2021,\n       and (2) that the clerk erroneously rejected the notice of appeal. We find plaintiff\u2019s\n       arguments unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the record does not support either of\n       plaintiff\u2019s factual assertions. Second, under our rules, plaintiff was required to have\n       its untimely filing excused by a court.\n\n\n\u00b6 19                                   1.

Instead, they are in the appendix to its appellant\u2019s brief. Plaintiff\u2019s appendix\n       includes, inter alia, documents titled \u201cNotice of Appeal Filed April 1, 2021\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information.\u201d Plaintiff labels each document as a supplemental\n       record exhibit. The \u201cE-Filing Envelope Information\u201d consists of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, which indicates that the April 1 filing was the notice of appeal with the\n       trial court\u2019s order included as an attachment. Based on these exhibits, plaintiff\n       maintains that its April 1 filing was \u201cRejected\u201d and that the clerk\u2019s explanation was\n       that there \u201cshould not be any attachments.\u201d The clerk directed plaintiff to \u201cresubmit\n       with all pages as one lead document.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the clerk\u2019s reason for\n       rejection was \u201cin contravention of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit\u2019s specific rule\n       requiring litigants to upload documents separately and expressly forbidding filers\n       from combining multiple documents into one PDF.\u201d See 19th Judicial Cir. Ct. R.\n       1-2.08(E) (Dec. 31, 2017) (\u201cBulk filings of multiple cases or multiple documents\n       combined into one PDF document shall not be accepted.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 22       Because the documents or exhibits are only found in the appendix, the facts and\n       inferences flowing from the documents or exhibits are not within the record. The\n       documents or exhibits were also not presented to the appellate court. In short,\n       evidence of plaintiff\u2019s assertions\u2014that it timely submitted its notice of appeal\n       electronically and that the clerk erroneously rejected the electronic filing\u2014is not\n       found in the common-law record. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 321 (eff. Oct. 1, 2021)\n       (\u201cContents of the Record on Appeal\u201d\u2014\u201cThe common law record includes every\n       document filed, judgment, and order entered and any exhibit offered and filed by\n       any party.\u201d). As will be discussed more fully below, plaintiff never filed a motion\n       in either the circuit or appellate court to challenge the propriety of the clerk\u2019s\n       rejection, and thus, the supporting documents were never made part of the record.\n       As a result, there is no basis in the record to find that plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal\n       was timely.\n\n\n\u00b6 23                   2. Plaintiff Failed to Seek Recourse for Its Untimely Filing\n\n\u00b6 24        Because plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, plaintiff was required to seek\n       relief. Plaintiff did not do so. That fact is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s claim that the appellate\n       court had jurisdiction. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on due process concerns is misplaced\n       because plaintiff did not utilize the remedies available. See Alvin v. Suzuki, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770490\"><a href=\"/opinion/770490/john-d-alvin-general-partner-pharmakon-inc-clinical-pathology-facility/\">227\n       F.3d 107</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[A] procedural due process violation cannot have\n       occurred when the governmental actor provides apparently adequate procedural\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f       remedies and the plaintiff has not availed himself of those remedies.\u201d). As\n       discussed above, two of our rules provide potential recourse for a litigant who has\n       an initial submission rejected by the clerk. Taking plaintiff\u2019s premise as true, that\n       the clerk erroneously applied local rules in rejecting his initial submission, one\n       would be hard-pressed to find a more compelling case of \u201cgood cause\u201d or\n       \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to allow plaintiff\u2019s appeal to proceed. However, plaintiff never\n       sought to establish that premise in either the circuit or appellate court. Because\n       plaintiff did not seek to excuse its untimely filing, it is left with the fact that its\n       notice of appeal was filed five days after the due date. The legal effect of that fact\n       is that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n\n\n\u00b6 25                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 26       Under our rules, when the clerk\u2019s rejection of a litigant\u2019s electronically filed\n       notice of appeal causes it to be untimely, the litigant must invoke the Illinois\n       Supreme Court rules to seek recourse. Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely,\n       and plaintiff did not seek recourse in our rules. Accordingly, the appellate court was\n       correct that it lacked jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u00b6 27      Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 28      Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/770490/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2031598/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2032819/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2161467/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2245183/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4147721/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4364837/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4636388/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6326443/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6347961/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6984750/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9322873/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9895589/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925362/", "id": 9925362, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467524/travelers-property-casualty-insurance-company-v-keyana-lipsey/", "cluster_id": 9467524, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467524/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:03:19.216940-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:03:23.518849-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "433a6a369f4d7f31fa86dbbd9c5038875eb5c6b2", "page_count": 1, "download_url": "https://efast.gaappeals.us/download?filingId=c08013a8-51da-4db2-a176-cd3dbd6e85d8", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/travelers_property_casualty_insurance_company_v._keyana_lipsey.pdf", "plain_text": "Court of Appeals\nof the State of Georgia\n\n                                                               ATLANTA, January 19, 2024\n\nThe Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order\n\nA24I0102.

The court most recently remanded in part to Commerce for\n\nfurther explanation of the record. See Mosaic Co. v. United States, 647 F.

In short, mining rights\nthemselves could not be valued so as to determine whether a subsidy occurred. Commerce,\ntherefore, substituted a cost-build up methodology to measure the value received to compare to a\nbenchmark for adequate remuneration. Accordingly, at this stage, only the cost-methodology is\nat issue.\n\fConsol. Court No. 21-00117                                                                  Page 3\n\n(\u201cGovernment\u201d), ask that the court sustain Commerce\u2019s Redetermination Results.

After Mosaic filed a CVD petition on June\n\n26, 2020, concerning imports of phosphate fertilizers from Russia, Commerce initiated the\n\ninvestigation on July 23, 2020. Petitions for the Imposition of Countervailing Duties: Phosphate\n\nFertilizers from Morocco and Russia, P.R. 1\u20138, C.R. 1\u20138 (June 26, 2020); Phosphate Fertilizers\n\nFrom the Kingdom of Morocco and the Russian Federation: Initiation of Countervailing Duty\n\nInvestigations, 85 Fed. Reg. 44,505 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 23, 2020). PhosAgro and Industrial\n\nGroup Phosphorite, LLC (\u201cEuroChem\u201d) were selected as mandatory respondents.                     See\n\nCountervailing Duty Investigation of Phosphate Fertilizers from Russia: Respondent Selection,\n\nP.R. 55, C.R. 23 (Aug. 4, 2020).\n\n       Commerce published its preliminary results on November 30, 2020, see Phosphate\n\nFertilizers From the Russian Federation: Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty\n\nDetermination, 85 Fed. Reg. 76,524 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 30, 2020), along with the\n\naccompanying Decision Memorandum for the Affirmative Preliminary Determination of the\n\nCountervailing Duty Investigation of Phosphate Fertilizers from the Russian Federation, C-821-\n\n825, POR 1/1/2019-12/31/2019 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 23, 2020).\n\n       Commerce published its final determination on February 16, 2021.             See Phosphate\n\nFertilizers From the Kingdom of Morocco and the Russian Federation: Countervailing Duty\n\nOrders, 86 Fed. Reg. 18,037 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Apr. 7, 2021); see also Issues and Decision\n\fConsol. Court No. 21-00117                                                                   Page 4\n\nMemorandum for the Final Affirmative Determination of the Countervailing Duty Investigation\n\nof Phosphate Fertilizers from the Russian Federation, C-821-825, POR 1/1/2019-12/31/2019\n\n(Dep\u2019t Commerce Feb. 8, 2021) (\u201cIDM\u201d).\n\n       In Mosaic II, the court sustained aspects of Commerce\u2019s analysis but ordered that on\n\nremand Commerce may: (1) explain why reconciling to PhosAgro\u2019s financial statements, as\n\nopposed to those of its subsidiary JSC Apatit, was sufficient and respond to Mosaic\u2019s objection or\n\nseek further information from the respondent; (2) explain why it found EuroChem\u2019s submission\n\nsupported and respond to Mosaic\u2019s specific objections; and (3) consider PhosAgro\u2019s arguments\n\nand explain why it selected Profit Before Tax rather than Gross Profit for the profit ratio. Mosaic\n\nII, at 1369\u201371.\n\n       Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, Commerce issued supplemental questionnaires to the\n\nmandatory respondents. See Commerce Letter to PhosAgro PJSC Supp. Questionnaire, R.P.R. 1\n\n(July 26, 2023); Commerce Letter to EuroChem Supplemental Questionnaire, R.P.R. 2 (July 26,\n\n2023). In its response, JSC Apatit reconciled its financial statements to those of its parent company\n\nPhosAgro. Response from Hogan Lovells US LLP to Sec of Commerce Pertaining to JSC Apatit\n\nSecond Supplemental Questionnaire Response, R.P.R. 6, R.C.R. 3 (Aug. 9, 2023). Similarly,\n\nEuroChem provided a fully translated version of its reported cost data. Response from Squire\n\nPatton Boggs (US) LLP to Sec of Commerce Pertaining to EuroChem Supplemental Questionnaire\n\nResponse, R.P.R. 4, R.C.R. 1 (Aug. 1, 2023). Commerce found the figures provided in each\n\nrespective response to be reliable.     Redetermination Results at 7, 9.      No party challenges\n\nCommerce\u2019s findings here; the court therefore affirms Commerce\u2019s Redetermination Results on\n\nthese grounds.\n\fConsol. Court No. 21-00117                                                                      Page 5\n\n        The only remaining issue in this case is the methodology used by Commerce to calculate\n\nPhosAgro\u2019s phosphate mining rights benefit. The court remanded to Commerce to further explain\n\nwhy it chose profit before tax, rather than gross profit, in its profit ratio calculation.2 Mosaic II, at\n\n1371 (\u201cCommerce did not proffer why Profit Before Tax was used in previous proceedings or\n\nexplain why it produced an accurate result now.\u201d). Because Commerce has done so now, the court\n\nsustains Commerce\u2019s Redetermination Results.\n\n                         JURISDICTION & STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The court\u2019s jurisdiction continues pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(i) and\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court sustains Commerce\u2019s final redetermination results unless they are\n\n\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]\u201d\n\n19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(i). \u201cThe results of a redetermination pursuant to court remand are also\n\nreviewed for compliance with the court\u2019s remand order.\u201d U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, 219\n\nF. Supp. 3d 1300, 1307 (CIT 2017) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n        According to PhosAgro, Commerce again erred by declining to use the company\u2019s gross\n\nprofit figure in its profit ratio calculation, which it argues \u201cmore accurately reflects the commercial\n\nreality of [its] pricing process.\u201d Consol. Pls. PhosAgro PJSC and JSC Apatit Comments on the\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Second Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court\n\n\n\n2\n  As explained in Mosaic II, \u201cCommerce calculated the phosphate rock cost of production by\ndividing JSC Apatit's reported \u2018Cost of Production\u2019 of phosphate rock by the total amount of\nphosphate rock produced, resulting in a per unit cost amount.\u201d Mosaic II, at 1370. \u201cCommerce\nthen multiplied the per unit cost amount by a \u2018profit ratio,\u2019 which Commerce calculated by\ndividing \u2018Profit Before Tax\u2019 by the total cost of sales in the financial statements.\u201d Id. A gross\nprofit calculation, by contrast, includes additional expenses such as administrative and selling\nexpenses.\n\fConsol. Court No. 21-00117                                                                 Page 6\n\nRemand at 2, ECF No. 133 (Nov. 13, 2023). It argues Commerce\u2019s chosen profit before tax\n\ncalculation \u201cleaves out important expenses and business considerations (e.g., administrative and\n\nselling expenses) from the profit comparison . . . .\u201d Id. at 3. Alternatively, if Commerce persists\n\nin its chosen methodology, PhosAgro argues for the inclusion of additional expenses that \u201care\n\nnecessary in order to ensure a reasonable comparison of the alleged benefit [it received].\u201d Id. at\n\n12. The Government supports Commerce\u2019s use of profit before tax and decision not to adjust for\n\nany additional expenses that \u201cwould compromise the profit ratio calculation and incorporate\n\nexpenses unrelated to mining and beneficiation activities.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. in Supp. of Remand\n\nResults at 19, ECF No. 142 (Dec. 13, 2023) (\u201cDef. Resp.\u201d).\n\n       Commerce \u201cmust examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\n\naction including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\n\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). On remand,\n\nCommerce further explained its decision to use profit before tax here. As Commerce explains,\n\nprofit before tax is narrower and helps to isolate costs for phosphate ore mining and beneficiation\n\nactivities. Redetermination Results at 19\u201325. Conversely, using a gross profit calculation would\n\ninclude costs unrelated to the mining of phosphate ore such as selling and administrative expenses,\n\ntaxes other than income taxes, and \u201cother\u201d expenses. Id. at 17.\n\n       PhosAgro has failed to demonstrate that including expenses broader than those involved in\n\nthe mining and beneficiation of phosphate ore would bolster Commerce\u2019s goal to render an\n\naccurate profit ratio. The court concludes Commerce has adequately explained its action, and its\n\fConsol.

The Commission\ndismissed the first complaint on the ground of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, and it dismissed the second after concluding the\nrecord provided no \u201creason to believe\u201d the alleged violation\noccurred. End Citizens United PAC filed suit, challenging both\ndismissals. The district court dismissed the suit, and we affirm.\nThe Commission\u2019s first dismissal is unreviewable because it\nwas based on prosecutorial discretion, and the second dismissal\nwas not contrary to law.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n     New Republican is a \u201cSuper PAC,\u201d meaning a political\naction committee \u201cthat makes only independent expenditures\nand cannot contribute to candidates.\u201d See McCutcheon v. FEC,\n572 U.S. 185, 193 n.2 (2014) (plurality opinion). Rick Scott\nbecame New Republican\u2019s chairman in May 2017 and formally\nstepped down in December 2017. He officially declared his run\nfor Senate in April 2018.\n\f                                 3\n     End Citizens United filed two administrative complaints\nwith the Commission, alleging New Republican and Scott1\nviolated several requirements of the Federal Election\nCampaign Act of 1971 (\u201cFECA\u201d). See Pub. L. No. 92-225, 86\nStat. 3 (codified as amended at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101 et seq.).\nAccording to End Citizens United, before officially declaring\nhis Senate run, Scott began informal campaign activities and\nused New Republican\u2019s resources to support his nascent\ncandidacy. He also allegedly continued to exert control over\nNew Republican into 2018\u2014well after his chairmanship\nended. He purportedly did this by fundraising for New\nRepublican, participating in conference calls, and interacting\nwith political allies connected to the PAC, among other things.\nImmediately after Scott officially declared his candidacy in\nApril 2018, New Republican revamped its website and issued\na press release to announce its \u201cfocus[] on the election of Rick\nScott in the race for Florida United States Senate.\u201d\n\n     Based on this timeline, End Citizens United\u2019s first\ncomplaint maintained that Scott became a \u201ccandidate\u201d in May\n2017, the same month he became chairman of New\nRepublican, and that he failed to register his campaign until\nnearly a year later. Complaint at 1\u20135, FEC Matter Under\nReview 7370 (\u201cComplaint One\u201d) (Apr. 23, 2018); see also 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30101(2) (defining \u201ccandidate\u201d); 11 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 100.72(a) (outlining permissible activities and reporting\nrequirements for individuals \u201cdetermining whether \u2026 [to]\nbecome a candidate\u201d). As a consequence of the alleged failure\nto timely register his campaign, Scott failed to make the\nnecessary filings and reports to the FEC. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 30102\u201304. The complaint also alleged that New Republican\n\n1\n End Citizens United also alleged Scott\u2019s campaign had violated\nFECA. For purposes of this case, we do not distinguish between\nScott and his campaign because the distinction is not relevant here.\n\f                               4\nunlawfully raised and spent funds while under Scott\u2019s control,\nbecause all candidate controlled entities are subject \u201cto\n[FECA\u2019s]      limitations,   prohibitions,  and     reporting\nrequirements.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30125(e)(1)(A).\n\n     The second complaint alleged unlawful coordination\nbetween Scott and New Republican. Complaint at 1\u20138, FEC\nMatter Under Review 7496 (\u201cComplaint Two\u201d) (Sept. 14,\n2018). New Republican launched two television commercials,\nin May and June 2018, against Scott\u2019s opponent in the Senate\nrace. End Citizens United alleged that New Republican had\nimpermissibly contributed to Scott\u2019s campaign by coordinating\nwith Scott to purchase the commercials. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30116(a)(7)(B)(i), (f) (specifying that, when a Super PAC\nmakes an expenditure \u201cin cooperation, consultation, or\nconcert[] with\u201d a candidate, that expenditure \u201cshall be\nconsidered\u201d an impermissible contribution even if the Super\nPAC never transferred funds directly to the candidate); see also\n11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21 (defining \u201ccoordinated communication\u201d).\nIn support of this claim, End Citizens United emphasized that\nScott had continued his involvement with New Republican for\nmonths after formally stepping down, including during the\nperiod when the advertisements were booked and paid for.\nScott and New Republican denied the allegations in both\ncomplaints.\n\n                              B.\n\n     After reviewing the complaints and responses, the\nCommission\u2019s general counsel recommended the Commission\nfind \u201creason to believe\u201d Scott and New Republican committed\nsome of the Complaint One violations. See 11 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 111.7(a). With respect to the Complaint Two coordination\nclaim, the general counsel relied on the sworn statement of\nBlaise Hazelwood, who took over New Republican after\n\f                               5\nScott\u2019s departure. Hazelwood stated that she had directed the\nadvertisement placements without coordinating with Scott or\nhis campaign. The general counsel noted that End Citizens\nUnited\u2019s complaint almost exclusively relied on the timing of\nthe campaign commercials, inferring coordination from the fact\nthat the commercials aired shortly after Scott stepped down\nfrom New Republican and formally announced his candidacy.\nAside from this \u201cmere temporal relationship,\u201d however, the\ngeneral counsel concluded there was \u201cno information available\nsuggesting\u201d coordination had occurred. The general counsel\nrecommended the Commission take no action on Complaint\nTwo and wait to see whether the recommended investigation\ninto Complaint One uncovered facts that would provide reason\nto believe New Republican had unlawfully coordinated with\nScott.\n\n     Under FECA, the Commission will begin an investigation\nonly if four commissioners determine there is \u201creason to\nbelieve\u201d a violation has occurred. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2).\n\u201c[A]n affirmative vote of four commissioners is required for\nthe agency to initiate enforcement proceedings.\u201d Citizens for\nResp. & Ethics in Wash. v.

See Combat Veterans for Cong. PAC v. FEC, 795\nF.3d 151, 153 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Here, three commissioners\nvoted to find reason to believe the violations had occurred, and\nthe other three voted to dismiss both complaints. Lacking the\nfour votes necessary to begin an investigation, the Commission\nvoted five to one to close the file and dismiss the complaints.\n\n    The three commissioners voting against enforcement, the\nso-called controlling commissioners, issued a Statement of\n\f                                 6\nReasons.2 Statement of Reasons of Vice Chair Allen Dickerson\nand Commissioners Sean J.

With respect to\nComplaint One, they offered legal and evidentiary grounds for\ndismissal. They also explicitly \u201cinvoked \u2026 prosecutorial\ndiscretion pursuant to Heckler v. Chaney,\u201d concluding it would\nbe unwise to \u201cauthoriz[e] an expensive and resource-\nconsuming investigation while the Commission is \u2026 working\nthrough a substantial backlog of cases.\u201d Id. at 10 (citing\nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985)). As to Complaint\nTwo, the controlling commissioners offered two independent\nreasons for dismissal. First, they suggested the coordination\nallegation could not go forward without \u201ca threshold finding\u201d\nthat Scott or New Republican had violated FECA\u2019s campaign\nregistration, filing, reporting, or spending requirements, as\nalleged in Complaint One. Id. at 2 n.2. Second, they\nincorporated by reference the general counsel\u2019s evidentiary\nanalysis, agreeing the record did not support a reason to believe\ncoordination had occurred. Id. at 5 n.25.\n\n     End Citizens United filed suit in 2021, challenging the\nCommission\u2019s dismissals as \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). The Commission did not defend its\ndismissals in district court. After allowing New Republican to\nintervene as a defendant, the district court granted summary\njudgment in New Republican\u2019s favor. End Citizens United\n\n2\n   The commissioners voting against enforcement are called\n\u201ccontrolling [c]ommissioners,\u201d and their stated reasons are \u201ctreated\nas if they were expressing the Commission\u2019s rationale for dismissal.\u201d\nNew Models, 993 F.3d at 883 n.3 (cleaned up); see also Democratic\nCong.

FEC, 795 F.2d 156, 161 (D.C. Cir.\n\n3\n  Since Orloski v. FEC, this circuit has included arbitrary and\ncapricious review, as well as abuse of discretion review, under\nFECA\u2019s \u201ccontrary to law\u201d standard. 795 F.2d 156, 161 (D.C. Cir.\n1986).

And FECA commits\nnonenforcement decisions to the Commission\u2019s discretion except to\nthe extent that they are \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d See New Models, 993 F.3d\nat 884. Neither Orloski nor the cases following it have explained why\nthe APA\u2019s arbitrary and capricious and abuse of discretion standards\nof review should be imported into FECA\u2019s \u201ccontrary to law\u201d\nstandard.

And \u201c[t]he Supreme Court in Akins recognized\nthat the Commission, like other Executive agencies, retains\nprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash.\nv. FEC, 475 F.3d 337, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citing FEC v.\nAkins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998)). It follows that the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cexercise of its prosecutorial discretion cannot\nbe subjected to judicial scrutiny.\u201d Comm\u2019n on Hope, 892 F.3d\nat 439. Furthermore, we recently reiterated that a Commission\ndismissal is unreviewable if it \u201cturn[s] in whole or in part on\nenforcement discretion.\u201d New Models, 993 F.3d at 894. A\ndismissal is reviewable \u201conly if the decision rests solely on\nlegal interpretation.\u201d Id. at 884; see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 25\u2013\n26 (explaining that \u201c[i]f a reviewing court agrees that the\nagency misinterpreted the law, it will set aside the agency\u2019s\naction and remand the case\u201d and that the petition can seek only\n\u201ca declaration that the FEC\u2019s dismissal \u2026 was unlawful\u201d).\n\n                               A.\n\n     The Commission\u2019s dismissal of the first complaint is an\nunreviewable exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. As End\nCitizens United concedes, the controlling commissioners\nexpressly invoked their prosecutorial discretion when\ndismissing the complaint. They cited Chaney repeatedly,\ndiscussed the time and expense an investigation would involve,\nand mentioned the Commission\u2019s \u201csubstantial backlog of\ncases.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 2, 10. Prioritizing particular\ncases and considering limited time and resources are\nquintessential elements of prosecutorial discretion. When the\n\f                               10\nCommission\u2019s dismissal rests even in part on prosecutorial\ndiscretion, it is not subject to judicial review. New Models, 993\nF.3d at 884, 893\u201395; see also Comm\u2019n on Hope, 892 F.3d at\n439.\n\n     Resisting the straightforward conclusion from our\ncaselaw, End Citizens United asserts the invocation of\nprosecutorial discretion is not determinative because the\ncontrolling commissioners relied on an interpretation of FECA.\nThe controlling commissioners concluded that whether Scott\nviolated FECA would turn on his \u201csubjective intent\u201d during the\nrelevant timeframe\u2014an apparent reference to whether Scott\nformed an intention to launch a Senate campaign while he was\nthe chairman of New Republican. Statement of Reasons at 10.\nBecause the dismissal rested in part on this legal analysis, End\nCitizens United contends we can review whether the dismissal\nwas contrary to law.\n\n     We have repeatedly declined to review dismissals in\nsimilar circumstances because we will not \u201ccarve out the\nCommission\u2019s statutory interpretation from its exercise of\nenforcement discretion\u201d in order to review a dismissal. New\nModels, 993 F.3d at 886; Comm\u2019n on Hope, 892 F.3d at 442\n(\u201cThe law of this circuit rejects the notion of carving\nreviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-reviewable\nactions.\u201d) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court has similarly\nrejected \u201cthe principle that if [an] agency gives a \u2018reviewable\u2019\nreason for otherwise unreviewable action, the action becomes\nreviewable.\u201d ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270,\n283 (1987). Nonenforcement decisions often turn on both\ndiscretionary factors and legal determinations, but a dismissal\nis entirely unreviewable if it depends even in part on\n\f                                  11\nenforcement discretion.4 See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831\n(acknowledging unreviewable enforcement decisions \u201coften\ninvolve[] a complicated balancing of a number of factors\u201d).\n\n    End Citizens United\u2019s approach flies in the face of binding\nprecedent by demanding this court review nonenforcement\n\n4\n  Unable to rebut this established caselaw, the dissent maintains that\nsome of the \u201cclaims\u201d in Complaint One were dismissed on the merits,\nnot on prosecutorial discretion. Dissenting Op. 13\u201314. This splicing\nof the Statement of Reasons fails for multiple reasons. To begin with,\nEnd Citizens United did not raise this argument on appeal and\nrepeatedly recognizes that the controlling commissioners relied on\nprosecutorial discretion to dismiss the first complaint. See, e.g.,\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5. \u201c[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues\nfor decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters\nthe parties present.\u201d United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct.\n1575, 1579 (2020) (cleaned up).\n     In any event, on the merits, the dissent\u2019s interpretation misreads\nthe Statement of Reasons. When concluding the Statement, the\ncontrolling commissioners explicitly state, \u201c[u]ltimately, we\ndetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of our\nprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 10. And, contrary\nto the dissent, \u201cthis Matter\u201d was previously defined to include \u201cthe\ncomplaints received by the Commission on April 23, 2018,\u201d id. at 2\n(emphasis added), which is all of Complaint One, not just the \u201cfiling\u201d\nclaims. Moreover, the Statement does not clearly separate its analysis\nof the \u201csoft money\u201d claims and the \u201cfiling\u201d claims. Rather, the\ncontrolling commissioners explain the claims are inextricably\nconnected because \u201c[u]nder [FECA], New Republican can commit a\nsoft money violation only if Scott is a candidate. But if Scott was not\na candidate, then there can be no soft money violation.\u201d Id. at 7. The\ndiscussion of the \u201csoft money\u201d issue was predicated on \u201cassuming\narguendo that Scott had become a candidate at some point prior to\nhis formal announcement.\u201d Id. But on that threshold question, and\ntherefore with respect to all the claims in \u201cthis Matter,\u201d the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked prosecutorial discretion.\n\f                                12\ndecisions that turn even in part on legal interpretation. But the\nanalysis in the Statement of Reasons, which discussed legal\nreasons as well as prosecutorial discretion, cannot be\ndistinguished from the statement we found unreviewable in\nNew Models. That statement, like the one at issue here,\n\u201cprovided legal reasons \u2026 for declining enforcement\u201d in\naddition to invoking prosecutorial discretion. New Models, 993\nF.3d at 885\u201386. There are no grounds for distinguishing the two\ncases, so we cannot review the dismissal.\n\n     End Citizens United also explicitly asks us to depart from\nCommission on Hope and New Models because they conflict\nwith earlier decisions. We addressed the same argument at\nlength in New Models, explaining why that decision was\nconsistent with the text and structure of FECA, as well as with\nthe cases on which End Citizens United now relies. Id. at 892\u2013\n95 (explaining consistency with Akins, 524 U.S. 11;\nDemocratic Cong. Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 831 F.2d 1131\n(D.C. Cir. 1987); Chamber of Com. v. FEC, 69 F.3d 600 (D.C.\nCir. 1995); and Orloski, 795 F.2d 156). Commission on Hope\nand New Models accord with our prior case law and are binding\non this panel.\n\n     Our dissenting colleague similarly seeks to relitigate these\nsettled decisions.5 In FECA, Congress specifically \u201crequired\n\n5\n  A judge\u2019s disagreement with settled law does not make it any less\nsettled. This court has consistently followed New Models and\nCommission on Hope. See, e.g., Campaign Legal Ctr. v. FEC, 22-\n5339, 2024 WL 57355, at *11 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 5, 2024); see also End\nCitizens United PAC v. FEC, 69 F.4th 916, 920\u201321 (D.C. Cir. 2023).\nAnd we have twice denied full court rehearing on the issue. See\nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC (\u201cCommission on Hope\nII\u201d), 923 F.3d 1141, 1142 (D.C. Cir. 2019); Citizens for Resp. &\nEthics in Wash. v. FEC (\u201cNew Models II\u201d), 55 F.4th 918, 919 (D.C.\nCir. 2022).\n\f                                 13\nthe Commission to clear a series of bipartisan vetogates before\ncommencing an enforcement action.\u201d Citizens for Resp. &\nEthics in Wash. v.

This means, of course, that three commissioners may\nblock the investigation and enforcement of a complaint.6\nUnable to abide the \u201cCommission\u2019s passivity,\u201d the dissent\nenvisions a dynamic role for the courts to encourage, prompt,\nand prise open the courthouse doors to the enforcement of\ncampaign finance laws. Dissenting Op. 11. When the\nCommission invokes prosecutorial discretion, the dissent sees\nthis as an attempt to \u201cevade the stimulus to move forward to\nenforce the law.\u201d Id. at 3. Moreover, \u201c[i]t is the court\u2019s role to\ndetect statutory misreading and thereby prod a reluctant FEC\nto act.\u201d Id. at 7. And it is apparently also the court\u2019s role to\ndetermine whether a complaint is \u201clegally sufficient to\nproceed.\u201d Id. at 12.\n\n    Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, the statute provides\nonly a modest role for the courts in determining whether a\n\n6\n  The dissent maintains the Commission may rely on prosecutorial\ndiscretion only when four commissioners agree. See Dissenting Op.\n9\u201311. Yet no provision in FECA requires four votes to dismiss a\ncomplaint. See New Models, 993 F.3d at 891 & n.10. In fact, then-\nJudge Ruth Bader Ginsburg specifically emphasized that when the\nCommission \u201cdeadlocks and for that reason dismisses a complaint,\u201d\nthe dismissal is judicially reviewable. Democratic Cong. Campaign\nComm., 831 F.2d at 1132 (cleaned up). Judge Ginsburg highlighted\nthat although a 6-0 decision \u201cmight represent a firmer exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion,\u201d the 6-0 decision and a deadlocked one were\nboth reviewable because \u201cwe resist confining the judicial check to\ncases in which \u2026 the Commission \u2018act[s] on the merits.\u2019\u201d Id. at\n1134. The dissent agrees that Commission deadlocks are reviewable,\nand nothing in our caselaw suggests we must turn a blind eye to the\ninvocation of prosecutorial discretion in a deadlock dismissal.\n\f                               14\ndismissal or failure to act is \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). As we have long recognized, the\nCommission, \u201cnot a court of review,\u201d must \u201cserve as the\nprimary decisionmaker in the area Congress has\ncommitted \u2026 to the FEC\u2019s charge.\u201d Democratic Cong.\nCampaign Comm., 831 F.2d at 1133; see also FEC v.\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37\n(1981) (explaining the Commission has the \u201csole discretionary\npower to determine in the first instance whether or not a civil\nviolation of [FECA] has occurred\u201d) (cleaned up). When the\nCommission cannot garner four votes for an investigation, and\ndismissal of the complaint turns on prosecutorial discretion,\nthere is simply no legal reasoning to review. FECA does not\nconfer on the courts a general power to enforce the law, which\ninstead belongs to the Commission in the exercise of its\nexecutive power.\n\n     Although the district court correctly held the dismissal of\nComplaint One was not reviewable because the Commission\u2019s\ndecision rested in part on prosecutorial discretion, the court\nmistakenly characterized this as a jurisdictional issue. The non-\nreviewability of prosecutorial discretion under Chaney is not\njurisdictional; rather, it deprives the plaintiff of a cause of\naction. Oryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, 524\u201326 (D.C. Cir.\n2009). We therefore modify the district court\u2019s judgment and\naffirm.\n\n                               B.\n\n                               1.\n\n     The dismissal of Complaint Two is reviewable. Without\nany reliance on prosecutorial discretion, the controlling\ncommissioners offered two legal determinations to support the\ndismissal, and we review these conclusions under the contrary\nto law standard. The first reason for dismissal was that if none\n\f                                  15\nof the \u201cthreshold\u201d violations alleged in Complaint One had\noccurred, then illegal coordination (as alleged in Complaint\nTwo) also could not have occurred as a matter of law.\nStatement of Reasons at 2 n.2. That was \u201ca legal determination\nnot committed to the agency\u2019s unreviewable discretion.\u201d New\nModels, 993 F.3d at 884\u201385 (cleaned up). The second reason\nfor dismissal was that there was not enough evidence to find\nreason to believe a violation of FECA had occurred. Statement\nof Reasons at 5 n.25.\n\n     Assessing whether certain acts constitute FECA violations\nand whether the facts in the record provide reason to believe a\nviolation occurred are treated as judicially reviewable under the\ncontrary to law standard.7 See Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242\u201344\n(reviewing the FEC\u2019s determination that there was insufficient\nevidence for a reason to believe finding); Orloski, 795 F.2d at\n167 (same).\n\n     Under our precedents, a dismissal is contrary to law if it\nmisinterprets the statute, is arbitrary or capricious, or is an\nabuse of discretion. See, e.g., Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242. This\nreview is \u201cextremely deferential\u201d when the Commission finds\nno reason to believe a violation has occurred. Orloski, 795 F.2d\nat 167; see Hagelin, 411 F.3d at 242 (rejecting the argument\nthat \u201ca less deferential standard of review\u201d applies to reason to\nbelieve dismissals and observing \u201cwe have held just the\n\n7\n  We reject New Republican\u2019s suggestion in passing that\u2014because\nthe first complaint was dismissed on the basis of prosecutorial\ndiscretion\u2014the dismissal of the second complaint is also\nunreviewable. Enforcement discretion not to pursue one complaint\ndoes not necessarily apply to another complaint, even when multiple\ndismissals are explained in a single statement of reasons. See 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C) (\u201cIn any proceeding under this paragraph\nthe court may declare that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure\nto act is contrary to law.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\f                               16\nopposite\u201d). Commission dismissals at the reason to believe\nstage are highly context specific and involve detailed\nconsideration of the record, so we will not lightly disturb them.\n\n                               2.\n\n     The controlling commissioners found no reason to believe\nthere was a violation of FECA and, therefore, declined to\ninvestigate the allegations made in Complaint Two. The\ncontrolling commissioners based their dismissal on the general\ncounsel\u2019s report, which \u201ccustomarily provides the basis for [the\nCommission\u2019s] action\u201d for purposes of judicial review.\nHagelin, 411 F.3d at 239 (cleaned up). The report referred to\nHazelwood\u2019s sworn assertion that, as the new chairwoman of\nNew Republican, she had placed the television advertisements\nwithout coordinating with Scott or his campaign. That\nconclusion comported with the record, especially given\nComplaint Two\u2019s heavy reliance on the \u201cmere temporal\nrelationship\u201d between Scott\u2019s leaving New Republican and the\nplacement of the commercials. The general counsel also\npointed to the lack of other evidence suggesting coordination.\nAt this threshold stage, the Commission was voting on whether\nto begin an investigation, and \u201c[b]efore it may act, the\nCommission must find \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that a violation of\n[FECA] has occurred.\u201d Combat Veterans, 795 F.3d at 153\n(quoting 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2)). Relying on the record and\nthe determinations of the general counsel, the controlling\ncommissioners reasonably dismissed Complaint Two.\n\n     End Citizens United raises various objections, primarily\nattempting to show the dismissal of Complaint Two was\ncontrary to law because it was inadequately reasoned. End\nCitizens United first suggests the controlling commissioners\nshould have offered a more detailed explanation rather than\nrelying on the general counsel\u2019s findings. But where the\n\f                              17\ncontrolling commissioners\u2019 \u201creliance on the General Counsel\u2019s\nrecommendation and analysis of the relevant statutory\nprovisions [is] sufficiently reasonable to be accepted,\u201d this\ncourt \u201cwill not disturb their decision.\u201d Democracy 21, 952 F.3d\nat 358 (cleaned up). Second, End Citizens United notes the\ngeneral counsel doubted Hazelwood\u2019s credibility on some\npoints. These concerns, however, do not undermine the fact\nthat the general counsel did not doubt Hazelwood\u2019s statements\nabout the television advertisements that were the subject of the\ncoordination claim. And the controlling commissioners\nreasonably concluded the credibility of Hazelwood\u2019s\nstatements was bolstered by the fact she made them under\npenalty of perjury.\n\n     Third, End Citizens United points out the general\ncounsel\u2019s ultimate recommendation was to defer action on the\nsecond complaint rather than dismissing it outright. But the\ngeneral counsel also concluded there was insufficient evidence\nto support a reason to believe finding for the second complaint.\nThe general counsel\u2019s additional recommendation to defer\naction assumed the Commission would investigate the first\ncomplaint allegations, which might, in turn, uncover evidence\nof unlawful coordination. But the controlling commissioners\ncorrectly recognized that their dismissal of the first complaint\nforeclosed any further investigation, which meant no additional\nfacts would come to light. And as already discussed, the record\ndid not otherwise provide reason to believe a coordination\nviolation occurred. The controlling commissioners accordingly\nvoted to dismiss for insufficient evidence. That was both\nreasonable and lawful.\n\n     Finally, End Citizens United presses a more conventional\ncontrary to law challenge, faulting the controlling\ncommissioners for their apparent view that a coordination\nviolation was impossible as a matter of law unless at least one\n\f                                  18\n\u201cthreshold\u201d Complaint One violation also occurred. We need\nnot address this parallel reason for dismissal. Even if the\ncontrolling commissioners were wrong to treat a Complaint\nOne violation as a threshold issue, End Citizens United has not\ncarried its \u201cburden to demonstrate prejudicial error.\u201d Jicarilla\nApache Nation v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 613 F.3d 1112, 1121\n(D.C. Cir. 2010). The APA directs courts to take \u201cdue\naccount \u2026 of the rule of prejudicial error,\u201d and that principle\napplies in this context. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; Comm\u2019n on Hope, 892\nF.3d at 437 (explaining the APA continues to apply absent a\nclear statement to the contrary). \u201c[W]hen an agency relies on\nmultiple grounds for its decision, some of which are invalid,\nwe may nonetheless sustain the decision as long as one is valid\nand the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if\nthe other were unavailable.\u201d8 Bally\u2019s Park Place, Inc. v. NLRB,\n646 F.3d 929, 939 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (cleaned up).\n\n    As already discussed, the three controlling commissioners\ndetermined there was no reason to believe impermissible\ncoordination had occurred. With a deadlocked Commission\nand short of the four votes necessary for an investigation,\ndismissal was required under FECA. See Combat Veterans,\n795 F.3d at 153; see also Public Citizen, Inc. v. FERC, 839 F.3d\n1165, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (explaining that, unlike in the\ncontext of FERC deadlocks, FECA \u201ccompels [the] FEC to\ndismiss complaints in deadlock situations\u201d).\n\n\n8\n  End Citizens United also asserts the controlling commissioners\u2019\nevidentiary conclusion cannot have been an independent basis for\ndismissal because their discussion cross-referenced the discussion\nabout \u201cthreshold\u201d violations. But the failure to find reason to believe\nwas sufficient for dismissal as a matter of law, and a mere cross-\nreference does not change that conclusion. See Combat Veterans,\n795 F.3d at 153. Nothing in the Statement of Reasons suggests the\ncontrolling commissioners thought otherwise.\n\f                             19\n     While the dismissal of Complaint Two is reviewable, End\nCitizens United has failed to show the dismissal was contrary\nto law. The controlling commissioners reasonably credited the\ngeneral counsel\u2019s careful evidentiary determinations and\nconcluded the record provided no reason to believe a violation\nhad occurred.\n\n                            ***\n\n    The Commission\u2019s dismissal of Complaint One was an\nunreviewable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The\ndismissal of Complaint Two was reviewable, and the district\ncourt correctly held the Commission\u2019s dismissal was not\ncontrary to law. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s\njudgment as modified.\n\n                                                  So ordered.\n\f     PILLARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:    The Federal Election Commission (FEC or\nCommission) dismissed two complaints. I agree with the\nmajority that the Commission\u2019s dismissal of the second\ncomplaint is reviewable and that it was not contrary to law.\nAccordingly, I join Part II.B. of the majority opinion. I dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s ruling that an invocation of enforcement\ndiscretion by a non-majority of commissioners as to certain\nclaims in the first complaint prevents us from reviewing that\ncomplaint. Even if I agreed that such a non-majority statement\nbarred judicial review, I would dissent from the court\u2019s\ndecision to apply that bar more broadly than did the\ncommissioners themselves.\n\n     Congress passed the Federal Elections Campaign Act\n(FECA) to address corrosive influences of money in politics.\nResponsive to the distinctive challenges of regulating political\nactivity, FECA is unique among federal laws in three important\nways. First, to prevent partisan domination, the law\u2019s primary\nenforcer\u2014the six-member Commission\u2014has no partisan\nmajority or chair and cannot officially take enforcement actions\nwithout a bipartisan majority. Second, to avoid nullification of\nFECA by a non-majority bloc of commissioners refusing to act\non apparent violations of campaign-finance laws, Congress\nmade such refusals to act\u2014no matter the reason\u2014reviewable\nin court. If a court holds that the allegations or evidence before\nthe FEC present a legally tenable claim, the Commission gets\nanother chance to enforce. Recognizing that the Commission\nmight still deadlock, FECA includes a third distinctive feature,\navailable only if the Commission fails to move forward: a\nprivate right of action to take up the case independent of FEC\nresources or initiative.\n\n     Five years ago, a divided panel of this court in Citizens for\nResp. & Ethics in Washington v. FEC (Commission on Hope\nI), 892 F.3d 434 (D.C. Cir. 2018), upended this carefully\ncrafted statutory scheme. Embracing a position that no party\n\f                              2\nhad even briefed and that the FEC disclaimed, the court held\nthat Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), enables a non-\nmajority bloc of commissioners to shield nonenforcement\ndecisions from judicial review, and thereby extinguish the\nprivate right of action, just by invoking the words\n\u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Three years later, another divided\npanel embraced that misguided decision. Citizens for Resp. &\nEthics in Wash. v. FEC (New Models I), 993 F.3d 880, 882\n(D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\n     I have explained elsewhere why those rulings conflict with\nFECA\u2019s terms, structure, and purpose; with the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998); and with\nour decisions in Chamber of Commerce v. FEC, 69 F.3d 600\n(D.C. Cir. 1995), Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee v. FEC (DCCC), 831 F.2d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1987),\nand Orloski v. FEC, 795 F.2d 156 (D.C. Cir. 1986). See\nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC (Commission on\nHope II), 923 F.3d 1141, 1145 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Pillard, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also\nCommission on Hope I, 892 F.3d at 442-46 (Pillard, J.,\ndissenting). My colleagues have voiced similar concerns. See\nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC (New Models II),\n55 F.4th 918, 922-32 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (Millett, J., dissenting\nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc); New Models I, 993 F.3d\nat 895-906 (Millett, J., dissenting); Campaign Legal Ctr. &\nDemocracy 21 v. FEC, 952 F.3d 352, 358-63 (D.C. Cir. 2020)\n(Edwards, J., concurring); Commission on Hope II, 923 F.3d at\n1142 (Griffith, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en\nbanc).\n\n     Since our court\u2019s wrong turn in applying Heckler to\neffectively scuttle FECA\u2019s enforcement mechanism, partisan\nblocs of commissioners have taken advantage of the error.\nThey have routinely cited \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to stymie\n\f                               3\njudicial scrutiny of apparently serious FECA violations, evade\nthe stimulus to move forward to enforce the law that a correct\nlegal interpretation could provide, and annul the private right\nof action that Congress authorized. As Judge Millett has noted,\n\u201c[s]ince Commission on Hope, approximately two-thirds of\nCommission cases dismissed contrary to the General Counsel\u2019s\nreason-to-believe recommendation have included a reference\nto prosecutorial discretion.\u201d New Models II, 55 F.4th at 929\n(Millett, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).\n\n    Today, the majority triples down. In applying the two\nmistaken rulings, it compounds their error: The opinion\nincorrectly concludes that the commissioners invoked\nenforcement discretion as to all the claims in the first\ncomplaint, Maj. Op. 9, when in reality they did so only with\nrespect to a portion of them. Because Commission on Hope\nand New Models flout binding precedent, they are not\nthemselves \u201cbinding on this panel.\u201d Maj. Op. 12. And even if\nthey were, nothing in those cases prevents us from considering\nthe claims the blocking commissioners dismissed on their\nmerits. I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n                               I.\n\n    The majority obscures important components of the statute\nwe are tasked with interpreting, so I begin with a fuller recap.\n\n                              A.\n\n     To protect the democratic process and bolster public\nconfidence in it, FECA \u201cseeks to remedy any actual or\nperceived corruption of the political process.\u201d Akins, 524 U.S.\nat 14. One of the ways it does so is by limiting the sources and\namounts of expenditures and contributions made \u201cfor the\npurpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\u201d 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(a)(i), (9)(A)(i); id. \u00a7 30116. Soon after\n\f                              4\nCongress enacted FECA, however, the Supreme Court began\nto invalidate many of the Act\u2019s expenditure limits as contrary\nto the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech. See\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 58 (1976) (declaring\nunconstitutional various limits on individual, candidate, and\ncampaign expenditures); see also, e.g., Citizens United v. FEC,\n558 U.S. 310, 365 (2010) (declaring unconstitutional the limit\non corporate expenditures now codified at 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30118(b)). Those decisions leave FECA\u2019s other primary\ntool\u2014disclosure requirements, see, e.g., 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\u2014\nto do much of the work of addressing corrosive influences of\nmoney in politics. Even as the Court struck down expenditure\nlimits, it sustained disclaimer, registration, and disclosure\nrequirements, approving of them as less restrictive ways to\n\u201cenable[] the electorate to make informed decisions and give\nproper weight to different speakers and messages.\u201d Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 371.\n\n     Compliance with campaign finance rules depends on\neffective enforcement and its deterrent effects. Primary\nenforcement responsibility lies with the FEC. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30107(a)(6). The Commission is composed of six members,\nno more than three of whom may be affiliated with a single\npolitical party. Id. \u00a7 30106(a)(1). All decisions must \u201cbe made\nby a majority vote of the members of the Commission,\u201d with\nthe important enforcement decisions specifically requiring a\nbipartisan majority of four or more votes. Id. \u00a7 30106(c). That\nmeans it always takes a majority\u2014indeed, assuming no\nabstentions, a bipartisan majority\u2014to \u201cexercise\u201d the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cduties and powers.\u201d See id.\n\n     In addition to conducting its own investigations, the\nCommission can act on complaints from \u201c[a]ny person\u201d\nalleging campaign finance violations. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(1), (2).\n\f                                5\nFECA maps out a four-step enforcement process for the\nCommission to follow in response to a complaint.\n\n\u2022   First, the Commission votes on whether there is \u201creason to\n    believe\u201d that a violation has occurred. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(2).\n    To tee up such a vote, the Commission\u2019s Office of General\n    Counsel reviews the submissions\u2014including the complaint\n    (with any attached materials such as sworn affidavits) and\n    response\u2014and offers its recommendations. Guidebook for\n    Complainants and Respondents on the FEC Enforcement\n    Process, FEC, at 11-12 (May 2012). 1                   If four\n    commissioners vote that there is reason to believe, the\n    Commission \u201cshall make an investigation of such alleged\n    violation.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\u2022   Second, after the investigation, the Commission votes on\n    whether there is \u201cprobable cause to believe\u201d that a violation\n    has occurred.         Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(4)(A)(i).        If four\n    commissioners agree there is probable cause, the\n    Commission \u201cshall attempt\u201d informal conciliation efforts.\n    Id. (emphasis added).\n\u2022   Third, the Commission votes on whether to approve a\n    conciliation agreement. Id.\n\u2022   Finally, if the conciliation agreement fails to garner four\n    votes, \u201cthe Commission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4\n    of its members, institute a civil action for relief\u201d in federal\n    district court. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A).\n\n     But the Commission need not follow this four-step process\nin every case. It has the power to \u201cvote to dismiss\u201d a complaint\nat any time. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(1). As with \u201c[a]ll decisions of the\nCommission,\u201d dismissal requires a \u201cmajority vote.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30106(c).

As a\nsafeguard against unreasoned deadlocks by commissioners not\nenforcing the law, Congress explicitly provided for judicial\nreview of both \u201cdismissal\u201d decisions and \u201cfailure[s] to act.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). If the Commission dismisses a complaint or\nfails to act on it within 120 days, an aggrieved party \u201cmay file\na petition\u201d in federal district court. Id. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(A). The\ncourt may then \u201cdeclare [whether] the dismissal of the\ncomplaint or the failure to act is contrary to law.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). A dismissal is \u201ccontrary to law\u201d if, among\nother things, the Commission relied on an impermissible\nconstruction of FECA or if the dismissal was otherwise\narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Orloski, 795\nF.2d at 161. 2\n\n                                 B.\n\n      As noted above, FECA\u2019s judicial review provision is\n\u201cunusual.\u201d Chamber of Commerce, 69 F.3d at 603. Generally,\nas the Supreme Court has explained, \u201can agency\u2019s decision not\nto undertake an enforcement action . . . [is] not subject to\njudicial review.\u201d Akins, 524 U.S. at 26 (citing Heckler, 470\nU.S. at 832). But FECA \u201cexplicitly indicates the contrary\u201d\u2014\ni.e., that the Commission\u2019s decision not to undertake an\nenforcement action is subject to judicial review. Id.\n\n   To facilitate that review, commissioners voting against the\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s enforcement recommendation have an\n\n2\n     The majority suggests in dicta that Orloski and its progeny\nwrongly incorporate arbitrary-and-capricious and abuse-of-\ndiscretion review into FECA\u2019s contrary-to-law standard. Maj. Op.\n7-8 n.3. I would not wander so far afield. The appellee raised no\nobjection to those standards of review, instead quoting as governing\nlaw the very standards the majority would reject. Appellee Br. 6, 28.\n\f                               7\nopportunity to issue one or more statements explaining the\nreasons for their votes. Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d 436,\n449 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Blocking commissioners\u2019 statements of\nreasons help \u201cto make judicial review a meaningful exercise,\u201d\nFEC v. Nat\u2019l Republican Sen. Comm., 966 F.2d 1471, 1476\n(D.C. Cir. 1992). A non-majority cannot speak for the\nCommission, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(c), but non-majority\nstatements can cast light on the reasons for those members\u2019\nvotes. We have long considered both statements of reasons and\nFEC General Counsel\u2019s reports in determining whether a\nCommission action in dismissing a case is \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d\nDCCC, 831 F.2d at 1132, 1134-35.\n\n     FECA\u2019s judicial review provision is unusual for another\nreason. Even when a court determines that a dismissal or\nfailure to act is contrary to law, the Commission retains the\noption not to move forward with enforcement. It has 30 days\nto \u201cconform\u201d with the court\u2019s declaration by, for example,\nproceeding to investigate, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(2), or seeking\nto conciliate as to, id. \u00a7 30109(a)(4)(i), an apparent FECA\nviolation, see id. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). If it declines to do so\u2014for\nwhatever reason\u2014FECA empowers the original complainant\nto bring a \u201ccivil action to remedy the violation involved in the\noriginal complaint.\u201d Id. In other words, a court cannot force\nthe Commission to enforce the law; the statute instead\nauthorizes a private litigant to do so, and, even then, only\nfollowing a judicial determination that the Commission\u2019s\nrefusal to proceed was contrary to law.\n\n     In sum, judicial review under FECA is the countermeasure\nto otherwise predictable deadlock at the Commission. It is the\ncourt\u2019s role to detect statutory misreading and thereby prod a\nreluctant FEC to act. And, where the Commission remains\ninert, the court\u2019s ruling paves the way for private enforcement.\nBut the court today continues along the path marked by the\n\f                               8\nwrong turn in Commission on Hope, enabling a non-majority\nof the Commission to diminish the court\u2019s role under FECA\nand to eliminate the private right of action.\n\n                               II.\n\n      For our purposes, the facts of this case can be briefly\nsummarized. End Citizens United filed two administrative\ncomplaints against then-candidate Rick Scott, his campaign,\nand New Republican Political Action Committee (New\nRepublican). Because I agree with the majority\u2019s treatment of\nthe second complaint, I focus on the first. As relevant here, the\nfirst complaint contained four allegations: (1) that Scott failed\nto timely file a statement of candidacy in violation of 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30102(e)(1); (2) that Scott\u2019s campaign failed to timely file\nthe relevant organizational paperwork and disclosure reports in\nviolation of 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30103(a), 30104; (3) that New\nRepublican impermissibly raised and spent money in violation\nof 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125(e); and (4) that Scott impermissibly\nraised and spent money in violation of 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125(e). I\nrefer to the first two allegations as \u201cFiling Claims,\u201d and the\nlatter two as \u201cSoft-money Claims.\u201d\n\n     The Commission held four substantive votes. First, it\nvoted on whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that the Filing\nClaims stated FECA violations. The Commission split 3-3, so\nthe vote \u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 270 (May 28, 2021, Vote Certification).\nA few weeks later, the Commission voted on: (1) whether to\ndismiss the Filing Claims \u201cunder Heckler v. Chaney\u201d; (2)\nwhether there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d the Soft-money\nClaim against New Republican stated a FECA violation; and\n(3) whether to dismiss the Soft-money Claim against Scott.\nAgain, the Commission was evenly divided, so those votes also\n\u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021, Vote Certification).\nDeadlocked, the Commission agreed to \u201c[c]lose the file,\u201d\n\f                                9\nwhich administratively closed the case. J.A. 273 (June 14,\n2021, Vote Certification). Later, the so-called controlling\ncommissioners\u2014the ones who voted against moving forward\nwith enforcement\u2014issued a statement of reasons. They\nexplained that they (1) \u201cexercised [their] prosecutorial\ndiscretion regarding\u201d the Filing Claims; (2) \u201cvoted to find no\nreason to believe\u201d that New Republican violated the soft-\nmoney ban; and (3) \u201cdismissed [the Soft-money Claim against\nScott] for lack of evidence.\u201d J.A. 290-91.\n\n                               III.\n\n     The majority concludes that the dismissal of the first\ncomplaint is \u201cunreviewable\u201d under \u201cbinding precedent\u201d\nbecause \u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked\ntheir prosecutorial discretion.\u201d Maj. Op. 9, 11. I disagree.\nFirst, Commission on Hope and New Models are not binding\nprecedent because, as noted above, they conflict with earlier\ndecisions of the Supreme Court and this court. See Sierra Club\nv. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a\ndecision of one panel is inconsistent with the decision of a prior\npanel, the norm is that the later decision, being in violation of\nthat fixed law, cannot prevail.\u201d). Second, even assuming\nCommission on Hope and New Models are binding precedent,\nthe majority is wrong that all of the dismissals are\nunreviewable.\n\n                               A.\n\n     The majority repeats the mistakes from Commission on\nHope and New Models, which continue to call out for\ncorrection. Those cases held that, when a non-majority\npartisan bloc of commissioners invokes enforcement discretion\nto justify dismissing a complaint, courts cannot review that\ndecision under Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821. For at least\nthree reasons, that is incorrect.\n\f                              10\n    First, Heckler teaches that an \u201cagency\u2019s decision not to\nprosecute or enforce . . . is a decision generally committed to\nan agency\u2019s absolute discretion.\u201d 470 U.S. at 831 (emphasis\nadded). To count as action by the Commission, a decision to\n\u201cdismiss\u201d a claim must \u201cbe made by a majority vote.\u201d 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30106(c), 30109(a)(1). A dismissal vote predicated\non prosecutorial discretion by a majority of commissioners, for\nexample, would amount to an agency decision to refuse\nenforcement. If Heckler applied to FECA, that decision might\nbe unreviewable. In this case, though, the Commission\ndeadlocked; it could not garner a majority vote to do anything\nother than close the file.\n\n     Relying on Commission on Hope and New Models, the\nmajority erroneously treats the three controlling\ncommissioners\u2019 statement explaining their votes against\nenforcement as the Commission\u2019s decision to refuse\nenforcement. Maj. Op. 9-10. A statement of reasons, even by\na non-majority causing a deadlock, explains the standstill and\nhelps \u201cmake judicial review a meaningful exercise.\u201d Nat\u2019l\nRepublican Sen. Comm., 966 F.2d at 1476. But we do not\u2014\nand cannot\u2014treat the controlling commissioners\u2019 rationales or\nvotes as an \u201cexercise\u201d of the Commission\u2019s \u201cduties and\npowers.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(c). To the contrary, we have\nexplained that a statement of reasons for a non-majority\u2019s vote\ncannot be an \u201cofficial Commission decision,\u201d since the latter\nrequires \u201cat least a 4-2 majority vote.\u201d Common Cause, 842\nF.2d at 449 n.32 (emphasis in original). What is more, FECA\nalso provides for review of a \u201cfailure to act\u201d on a complaint\nwithin 120 days, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C), implying that a\ncourt may evaluate the legality of inaction even in the absence\nof any vote or statement of reasons.\n\n    Under the majority\u2019s view, it would make no difference\nwhether a partisan bloc of three commissioners or a bipartisan\n\f                              11\nmajority of four commissioners voted to dismiss a claim based\non prosecutorial discretion\u2014both would be unreviewable. But\nunder FECA, there is a critically important difference between\npartisan and bipartisan action. Even assuming a bipartisan\nmajority\u2019s vote to exercise prosecutorial discretion defeats\njudicial review, affording that power to a non-majority makes\na mockery of the \u201ccarefully balanced bipartisan structure which\nCongress has erected.\u201d Common Cause, 842 F.2d at 449 n.32.\nIt is perverse to treat a non-majority\u2019s statement of reasons,\nelicited to facilitate judicial review, as instead its ticket to\nbypass judicial review altogether. That alone shows that\nCommission on Hope and New Models are wrong.\n\n     Second, even if it were appropriate to treat a non-majority\ninvocation of prosecutorial discretion as an official\nCommission decision, Heckler still would not apply. Heckler\u2019s\npresumption of non-reviewability is just that: a presumption.\n470 U.S. at 831. It \u201cmay be rebutted where the substantive\nstatute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in\nexercising its enforcement powers.\u201d Id. at 833. In Akins, the\nSupreme Court ruled that FECA categorically rebuts that\npresumption because it \u201cexplicitly indicates\u201d that the\nCommission\u2019s decision \u201cnot to undertake an enforcement\naction\u201d is subject to judicial review to determine whether the\nCommission\u2019s passivity is contrary to law. 524 U.S. at 26.\nJudge Silberman, speaking for our en banc court in Akins,\ndescribed judicial review under FECA as \u201can unusual statutory\nprovision which permits a complainant to bring to federal court\nan agency\u2019s refusal to institute enforcement proceedings.\u201d 101\nF.3d 731, 734 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (distinguishing Chaney),\nvacated on other grounds, 524 U.S. 11 (1998). Commission on\nHope and New Models squarely contravene the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s and our own views in Akins, and multiple other\ndecisions of our circuit affirming the reviewability of the\nCommission\u2019s non-enforcement decisions. See, e.g., Chamber\n\f                               12\nof Commerce, 69 F.3d at 603; DCCC, 831 F.2d at 1133;\nOrloski, 795 F.2d at 161.\n\n     Third, Heckler emphasizes that an agency\u2019s non-\nenforcement decision is generally unreviewable because its\nenforcement activity should be \u201ccommitted to an agency\u2019s\nabsolute discretion.\u201d 470 U.S. at 831. That is so because the\nagency must itself assess \u201cwhether agency resources are best\nspent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely\nto succeed if it acts, [and] whether the particular enforcement\naction requested best fits the agency\u2019s overall policies.\u201d Id.\nBut judicial review under FECA need not intrude on the\nCommission\u2019s discretion to balance those factors. To the\ncontrary, FECA\u2019s creation of a private right of action means\nthat, if the Commission declines to investigate a complaint that\na court holds legally sufficient to proceed, private citizens may\ntake up the task without the Commission having to use its own\nresources or act under court direction. See 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). For this reason, too, the separation-of-\npowers concerns that animated Heckler (and that my\ncolleagues referenced in New Models I, see 993 F.3d at 888)\nare wholly misplaced in the context of FECA.\n\n    Crucially, the case before us does not raise the question\nwhether there may be some circumstances in which FECA\nauthorizes the Commission to exercise unreviewable\nenforcement discretion. For example, a bipartisan majority of\ncommissioners might be able to shut down the enforcement\nprocess at the reason-to-believe phase by explicitly dismissing\na complaint on enforcement-discretion grounds. 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(1); Guidebook at 12. In this case, though, the vote\nover whether to dismiss the Filing Claims \u201cunder Heckler v.\nChaney\u201d \u201cfailed\u201d\u2014it deadlocked 3-3. J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021,\nVote Certification). And the commissioners never even held\nsuch a vote with respect to the Soft-money Claims. So,\n\f                               13\nassuming a bipartisan majority of the Commission could wield\nunreviewable enforcement discretion, it did not do so in this\ncase. The Act also expressly grants discretion to halt a case if,\nafter the complaint travels through all the prescribed\ncheckpoints, the Commission votes against filing a civil action\nfor relief. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A). At that stage, the\nstatute switches from specifying that the commission \u201cshall\u201d\nproceed where statutory standards are met, id. \u00a7 30109(a)(2),\n(a)(4)(A)(i) (emphasis added), to providing that \u201cthe\nCommission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4 of its\nmembers, institute a civil action for relief,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(6)(A) (emphasis added). This case, however,\nstalled out at the very beginning, at the reason-to-believe phase.\nA non-majority incantation of enforcement discretion at that\nphase cannot interfere with the court\u2019s obligation under FECA\nto decide whether the Commission\u2019s inaction or dismissal was\n\u201ccontrary to law\u201d\u2014as it would be, for example, if the\ncommissioners voted to dismiss a complaint that, under the law\nas properly understood, gave \u201creason to believe that the\nrespondent has committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nFECA or the presidential campaign funding laws. Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(2), (a)(8)(C).\n\n     All these mistakes have something in common: They\nignore the many ways in which both the Commission and\nFECA\u2019s enforcement scheme are uniquely crafted to avoid\npartisan gridlock. The Supreme Court in Akins appreciated\nhow Congress intended to avoid that gridlock. And, before\nCommission on Hope, we did too.\n\n                               B.\n\n   The majority not only errs by applying Commission on\nHope and New Models; it also misreads the record in this case.\nThe majority rules that \u201cthe controlling commissioners\n\f                               14\nexpressly invoked their prosecutorial discretion when\ndismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj. Op. 9. That is incorrect. The\ncontrolling commissioners were clear in their statement of\nreasons that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. Because the Soft-money Claims\nwere dismissed on the merits, they are reviewable.\n\n     The majority contends that my opinion \u201cmisreads\u201d the\nstatement of reasons, Maj. Op. 11 n.4, but the statement speaks\nfor itself. Over and again, the controlling commissioners made\nclear that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. In the introduction, the controlling\ncommissions explained that they \u201cfound no reason to believe\nthat New Republican violated the soft money rules and\ndismissed the allegations that Scott untimely filed his\ncandidacy and organization paperwork under Heckler v.\nChaney.\u201d       J.A. 282.      In a footnote, the controlling\ncommissioners addressed the Soft-money Claim against Scott:\n\u201cHaving determined there was no path forward on those\nelements, we were required to dismiss\u201d the Soft-money Claim\nbecause that claim \u201cwould have required, at a minimum, a\nthreshold finding that Scott had failed to file a statement of\ncandidacy at the appropriate time, or that New Republican had\nviolated the soft money rules.\u201d J.A. 282 n.2. Later, the\ncontrolling commissioners repeated that \u201cas regards Rick\nScott\u2019s alleged failure to timely file his candidacy and\ncommittee paperwork, we invoked our prosecutorial discretion\npursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A. 290. And, in their\nconclusion, they summarized their votes:\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we voted to find no reason\n    to believe that New Republican violated the soft\n    money ban, exercised our prosecutorial discretion\n    regarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\n    committee failed to timely file candidacy and\n\f                              15\n    organization forms, and dismissed the remaining\n    allegations against the Respondents for lack of\n    evidence.\n\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\n     The controlling commissioners repeatedly tell us that they\nare dismissing the Soft-money claims on the merits, but the\nmajority refuses to take them at their word. It deems the\ndismissal of all four claims unreviewable on the theory that\n\u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked their\nprosecutorial discretion when dismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj.\nOp. 9. There is no basis for that conclusion. The majority\nemphasizes that the controlling commissioners at one point say\nthat they \u201cdetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of\nour prosecutorial discretion.\u201d J.A. 290. The majority appears\nto read \u201cthis Matter\u201d to mean \u201call the claims\u201d in the first\ncomplaint. Maj. Op. 11 n.4. That reading conflicts with what\nthe controlling commissioners actually say. After giving their\nreasons for invoking enforcement discretion, the controlling\ncommissioners clarify the scope of the invocation:\n\u201cAccordingly, as regards Rick Scott\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nfile his candidacy and committee paperwork, we invoked our\nprosecutorial discretion pursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A.\n290 (emphasis added). And they are even clearer in the\nconclusion, where they invoke prosecutorial discretion only\n\u201cregarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\ncommittee failed to timely file candidacy and organization\nforms.\u201d J.A. 290-91 (emphasis added). As to the Soft-money\nClaims, they say that they \u201cvoted to find no reason to believe\u201d\nNew Republican violated the soft money ban, and dismissed\nthe Soft-money Claim against Scott for \u201clack of evidence.\u201d\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\f                              16\n     The majority erroneously concludes that End Citizens\nUnited \u201cdid not raise this argument on appeal.\u201d Maj. Op. 11\nn.4. In fact, End Citizens United argued that dismissal of the\nSoft-money Claims was reviewable, Appellant\u2019s Br. 23-24,\nspecifically described that dismissal as based not on\nenforcement discretion but on an erroneous interpretation of\nFECA, id. 18, and confirmed during oral argument that the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims, not the Soft-money Claims, see\nOral Arg. Rec. at 7:43-9:48. The parties drew the same battle\nline in the district court, compare ECU Opp. to MTD 28-29,\nEnd Citizens United PAC v. FEC, No. 21-cv-2128 (D.D.C.\nSept. 16, 2022), ECF No. 25, with New Republican Reply 11,\nECF No. 29, and even New Republican does not assert\nforfeiture here.\n\n     The court has erred in empowering a partisan bloc of\ncommissioners to invoke enforcement discretion to evade\nreview the statute authorizes. Adding to the muddle that error\nhas created, today\u2019s majority relies on the bloc\u2019s discretionary\nreasoning about the Filing Claims to avoid reviewing the other\nclaims in the first complaint. Because the controlling\ncommissioners did not invoke enforcement discretion with\nrespect to the Soft-money Claims, I would hold the dismissal\nof those claims reviewable even under Commission on Hope\nand New Models.\n\n                             ***\n\n     As I have explained, Commission on Hope and New\nModels contravene FECA, ignore binding precedent, and\nundercut the distinctive features Congress crafted to prevent\npartisan gridlock. The majority\u2019s first mistake is to act as if\nthose decisions are \u201cbinding on this panel.\u201d Maj. Op. 12.\n\f                                  17\n     In any event, the majority overstates the reach of those\ncases. 3 It deems the dismissal of the Soft-money Claims\nunreviewable even though the controlling commissioners\nnever invoked prosecutorial discretion with respect to them.\nThat ruling does not follow from Commission on Hope or New\nModels. If our court is going to authorize a non-majority of\ncommissioners to thwart FECA by invoking prosecutorial\ndiscretion, we should take care to do so only where there is an\nactual invocation. I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Indeed, the majority\u2019s premise\u2014that Commission on Hope and\nNew Models govern this case\u2014is itself questionable. Those cases\nare best read as confined to circumstances in which the controlling\ncommissioners invoke prosecutorial discretion for reasons that are\nindependent of their view of the merits of the claim. See New Models\nII, 55 F.4th at 920-21 (Rao, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing\nen banc) (explaining that judicial review was foreclosed \u201c[b]ecause\nthe controlling commissioners relied on an independent ground of\nprosecutorial discretion\u201d); see also, e.g., Campaign Legal Ctr. v.\nFEC, No. 22-5339, 2024 WL 57355, at *5 (D.C.

See, e.g.,\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5. \u201c[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues\nfor decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters\nthe parties present.\u201d United States v.

When concluding the Statement, the\ncontrolling commissioners explicitly state, \u201c[u]ltimately, we\ndetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of our\nprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 10. And, contrary\nto the dissent, \u201cthis Matter\u201d was previously defined to include \u201cthe\ncomplaints received by the Commission on April 23, 2018,\u201d id. at 2\n(emphasis added), which is all of Complaint One, not just the \u201cfiling\u201d\nclaims. Moreover, the Statement does not clearly separate its analysis\nof the \u201csoft money\u201d claims and the \u201cfiling\u201d claims. Rather, the\ncontrolling commissioners explain the claims are inextricably\nconnected because \u201c[u]nder [FECA], New Republican can commit a\nsoft money violation only if Scott is a candidate. But if Scott was not\na candidate, then there can be no soft money violation.\u201d Id. at 7. The\ndiscussion of the \u201csoft money\u201d issue was predicated on \u201cassuming\narguendo that Scott had become a candidate at some point prior to\nhis formal announcement.\u201d Id. But on that threshold question, and\ntherefore with respect to all the claims in \u201cthis Matter,\u201d the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked prosecutorial discretion.\n\f                                12\ndecisions that turn even in part on legal interpretation. But the\nanalysis in the Statement of Reasons, which discussed legal\nreasons as well as prosecutorial discretion, cannot be\ndistinguished from the statement we found unreviewable in\nNew Models.

The\ncontrolling commissioners based their dismissal on the general\ncounsel\u2019s report, which \u201ccustomarily provides the basis for [the\nCommission\u2019s] action\u201d for purposes of judicial review.\nHagelin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186479\"><a href=\"/opinion/186479/hagelin-v-federal-election-commission/\">411 F.3d at 239</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (cleaned up). The report referred to\nHazelwood\u2019s sworn assertion that, as the new chairwoman of\nNew Republican, she had placed the television advertisements\nwithout coordinating with Scott or his campaign.

The general counsel also\npointed to the lack of other evidence suggesting coordination.\nAt this threshold stage, the Commission was voting on whether\nto begin an investigation, and \u201c[b]efore it may act, the\nCommission must find \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that a violation of\n[FECA] has occurred.\u201d Combat Veterans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2820796\"><a href=\"/opinion/2820796/combat-veterans-for-congress-political-action-committee-v-federal-election/\">795 F.3d at 153</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(quoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)). Relying on the record and\nthe determinations of the general counsel, the controlling\ncommissioners reasonably dismissed Complaint Two.\n\n     End Citizens United raises various objections, primarily\nattempting to show the dismissal of Complaint Two was\ncontrary to law because it was inadequately reasoned. End\nCitizens United first suggests the controlling commissioners\nshould have offered a more detailed explanation rather than\nrelying on the general counsel\u2019s findings. But where the\n\f                              17\ncontrolling commissioners\u2019 \u201creliance on the General Counsel\u2019s\nrecommendation and analysis of the relevant statutory\nprovisions [is] sufficiently reasonable to be accepted,\u201d this\ncourt \u201cwill not disturb their decision.\u201d Democracy 21, 952 F.3d\nat 358 (cleaned up). Second, End Citizens United notes the\ngeneral counsel doubted Hazelwood\u2019s credibility on some\npoints. These concerns, however, do not undermine the fact\nthat the general counsel did not doubt Hazelwood\u2019s statements\nabout the television advertisements that were the subject of the\ncoordination claim. And the controlling commissioners\nreasonably concluded the credibility of Hazelwood\u2019s\nstatements was bolstered by the fact she made them under\npenalty of perjury.\n\n     Third, End Citizens United points out the general\ncounsel\u2019s ultimate recommendation was to defer action on the\nsecond complaint rather than dismissing it outright. But the\ngeneral counsel also concluded there was insufficient evidence\nto support a reason to believe finding for the second complaint.\nThe general counsel\u2019s additional recommendation to defer\naction assumed the Commission would investigate the first\ncomplaint allegations, which might, in turn, uncover evidence\nof unlawful coordination. But the controlling commissioners\ncorrectly recognized that their dismissal of the first complaint\nforeclosed any further investigation, which meant no additional\nfacts would come to light. And as already discussed, the record\ndid not otherwise provide reason to believe a coordination\nviolation occurred. The controlling commissioners accordingly\nvoted to dismiss for insufficient evidence. That was both\nreasonable and lawful.\n\n     Finally, End Citizens United presses a more conventional\ncontrary to law challenge, faulting the controlling\ncommissioners for their apparent view that a coordination\nviolation was impossible as a matter of law unless at least one\n\f                                  18\n\u201cthreshold\u201d Complaint One violation also occurred. We need\nnot address this parallel reason for dismissal.

I agree with the\nmajority that the Commission\u2019s dismissal of the second\ncomplaint is reviewable and that it was not contrary to law.\nAccordingly, I join Part II.B. of the majority opinion. I dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s ruling that an invocation of enforcement\ndiscretion by a non-majority of commissioners as to certain\nclaims in the first complaint prevents us from reviewing that\ncomplaint. Even if I agreed that such a non-majority statement\nbarred judicial review, I would dissent from the court\u2019s\ndecision to apply that bar more broadly than did the\ncommissioners themselves.\n\n     Congress passed the Federal Elections Campaign Act\n(FECA) to address corrosive influences of money in politics.\nResponsive to the distinctive challenges of regulating political\nactivity, FECA is unique among federal laws in three important\nways. First, to prevent partisan domination, the law\u2019s primary\nenforcer\u2014the six-member Commission\u2014has no partisan\nmajority or chair and cannot officially take enforcement actions\nwithout a bipartisan majority. Second, to avoid nullification of\nFECA by a non-majority bloc of commissioners refusing to act\non apparent violations of campaign-finance laws, Congress\nmade such refusals to act\u2014no matter the reason\u2014reviewable\nin court. If a court holds that the allegations or evidence before\nthe FEC present a legally tenable claim, the Commission gets\nanother chance to enforce. Recognizing that the Commission\nmight still deadlock, FECA includes a third distinctive feature,\navailable only if the Commission fails to move forward: a\nprivate right of action to take up the case independent of FEC\nresources or initiative.\n\n     Five years ago, a divided panel of this court in Citizens for\nResp. &amp; Ethics in Washington v.

Even when a court determines that a dismissal or\nfailure to act is contrary to law, the Commission retains the\noption not to move forward with enforcement. It has 30 days\nto \u201cconform\u201d with the court\u2019s declaration by, for example,\nproceeding to investigate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2), or seeking\nto conciliate as to, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> \u00a7 30109(a)(4)(i), an apparent FECA\nviolation, see id. \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C).

In other words, a court cannot force\nthe Commission to enforce the law; the statute instead\nauthorizes a private litigant to do so, and, even then, only\nfollowing a judicial determination that the Commission\u2019s\nrefusal to proceed was contrary to law.\n\n     In sum, judicial review under FECA is the countermeasure\nto otherwise predictable deadlock at the Commission. It is the\ncourt\u2019s role to detect statutory misreading and thereby prod a\nreluctant FEC to act. And, where the Commission remains\ninert, the court\u2019s ruling paves the way for private enforcement.\nBut the court today continues along the path marked by the\n\f                               8\nwrong turn in Commission on Hope, enabling a non-majority\nof the Commission to diminish the court\u2019s role under FECA\nand to eliminate the private right of action.\n\n                               II.\n\n      For our purposes, the facts of this case can be briefly\nsummarized. End Citizens United filed two administrative\ncomplaints against then-candidate Rick Scott, his campaign,\nand New Republican Political Action Committee (New\nRepublican). Because I agree with the majority\u2019s treatment of\nthe second complaint, I focus on the first. As relevant here, the\nfirst complaint contained four allegations: (1) that Scott failed\nto timely file a statement of candidacy in violation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30102</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e)(1); (2) that Scott\u2019s campaign failed to timely file\nthe relevant organizational paperwork and disclosure reports in\nviolation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30103</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a), 30104; (3) that New\nRepublican impermissibly raised and spent money in violation\nof </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e); and (4) that Scott impermissibly\nraised and spent money in violation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e). I\nrefer to the first two allegations as \u201cFiling Claims,\u201d and the\nlatter two as \u201cSoft-money Claims.\u201d\n\n     The Commission held four substantive votes. First, it\nvoted on whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that the Filing\nClaims stated FECA violations. The Commission split 3-3, so\nthe vote \u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 270 (May 28, 2021, Vote Certification).\nA few weeks later, the Commission voted on: (1) whether to\ndismiss the Filing Claims \u201cunder Heckler v. Chaney\u201d; (2)\nwhether there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d the Soft-money\nClaim against New Republican stated a FECA violation; and\n(3) whether to dismiss the Soft-money Claim against Scott.\nAgain, the Commission was evenly divided, so those votes also\n\u201cfailed.\u201d J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021, Vote Certification).\nDeadlocked, the Commission agreed to \u201c[c]lose the file,\u201d\n\f                                9\nwhich administratively closed the case. J.A. 273 (June 14,\n2021, Vote Certification). Later, the so-called controlling\ncommissioners\u2014the ones who voted against moving forward\nwith enforcement\u2014issued a statement of reasons. They\nexplained that they (1) \u201cexercised [their] prosecutorial\ndiscretion regarding\u201d the Filing Claims; (2) \u201cvoted to find no\nreason to believe\u201d that New Republican violated the soft-\nmoney ban; and (3) \u201cdismissed [the Soft-money Claim against\nScott] for lack of evidence.\u201d J.A. 290-91.\n\n                               III.\n\n     The majority concludes that the dismissal of the first\ncomplaint is \u201cunreviewable\u201d under \u201cbinding precedent\u201d\nbecause \u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked\ntheir prosecutorial discretion.\u201d Maj. Op. 9, 11. I disagree.\nFirst, Commission on Hope and New Models are not binding\nprecedent because, as noted above, they conflict with earlier\ndecisions of the Supreme Court and this court. See Sierra Club\nv. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"220174\"><a href=\"/opinion/220174/sierra-club-v-jackson/\">648 F.3d 848</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a\ndecision of one panel is inconsistent with the decision of a prior\npanel, the norm is that the later decision, being in violation of\nthat fixed law, cannot prevail.\u201d). Second, even assuming\nCommission on Hope and New Models are binding precedent,\nthe majority is wrong that all of the dismissals are\nunreviewable.\n\n                               A.\n\n     The majority repeats the mistakes from Commission on\nHope and New Models, which continue to call out for\ncorrection. Those cases held that, when a non-majority\npartisan bloc of commissioners invokes enforcement discretion\nto justify dismissing a complaint, courts cannot review that\ndecision under Heckler v. Chaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\">470 U.S. 821</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. For at least\nthree reasons, that is incorrect.\n\f                              10\n    First, Heckler teaches that an \u201cagency\u2019s decision not to\nprosecute or enforce . . . is a decision generally committed to\nan agency\u2019s absolute discretion.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\">470 U.S. at 831</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis\nadded). To count as action by the Commission, a decision to\n\u201cdismiss\u201d a claim must \u201cbe made by a majority vote.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30106</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c), 30109(a)(1). A dismissal vote predicated\non prosecutorial discretion by a majority of commissioners, for\nexample, would amount to an agency decision to refuse\nenforcement. If Heckler applied to FECA, that decision might\nbe unreviewable. In this case, though, the Commission\ndeadlocked; it could not garner a majority vote to do anything\nother than close the file.\n\n     Relying on Commission on Hope and New Models, the\nmajority erroneously treats the three controlling\ncommissioners\u2019 statement explaining their votes against\nenforcement as the Commission\u2019s decision to refuse\nenforcement. Maj. Op. 9-10. A statement of reasons, even by\na non-majority causing a deadlock, explains the standstill and\nhelps \u201cmake judicial review a meaningful exercise.\u201d Nat\u2019l\nRepublican Sen.

But we do not\u2014\nand cannot\u2014treat the controlling commissioners\u2019 rationales or\nvotes as an \u201cexercise\u201d of the Commission\u2019s \u201cduties and\npowers.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c). To the contrary, we have\nexplained that a statement of reasons for a non-majority\u2019s vote\ncannot be an \u201cofficial Commission decision,\u201d since the latter\nrequires \u201cat least a 4-2 majority vote.\u201d Common Cause, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503418\"><a href=\"/opinion/503418/common-cause-v-federal-election-commission/\">842\nF.2d at </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">449 n.32 (emphasis in original).

But\nunder FECA, there is a critically important difference between\npartisan and bipartisan action. Even assuming a bipartisan\nmajority\u2019s vote to exercise prosecutorial discretion defeats\njudicial review, affording that power to a non-majority makes\na mockery of the \u201ccarefully balanced bipartisan structure which\nCongress has erected.\u201d Common Cause, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503418\"><a href=\"/opinion/503418/common-cause-v-federal-election-commission/\">842 F.2d at </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">449 n.32.\nIt is perverse to treat a non-majority\u2019s statement of reasons,\nelicited to facilitate judicial review, as instead its ticket to\nbypass judicial review altogether. That alone shows that\nCommission on Hope and New Models are wrong.\n\n     Second, even if it were appropriate to treat a non-majority\ninvocation of prosecutorial discretion as an official\nCommission decision, Heckler still would not apply. Heckler\u2019s\npresumption of non-reviewability is just that: a presumption.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\">470 U.S. at 831</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

In Akins, the\nSupreme Court ruled that FECA categorically rebuts that\npresumption because it \u201cexplicitly indicates\u201d that the\nCommission\u2019s decision \u201cnot to undertake an enforcement\naction\u201d is subject to judicial review to determine whether the\nCommission\u2019s passivity is contrary to law. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commission-v-akins/\">524 U.S. at 26</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nJudge Silberman, speaking for our en banc court in Akins,\ndescribed judicial review under FECA as \u201can unusual statutory\nprovision which permits a complainant to bring to federal court\nan agency\u2019s refusal to institute enforcement proceedings.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101\nF.3d 731</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (D.C.

Commission on\nHope and New Models squarely contravene the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s and our own views in Akins, and multiple other\ndecisions of our circuit affirming the reviewability of the\nCommission\u2019s non-enforcement decisions. See, e.g., Chamber\n\f                               12\nof Commerce, 69 F.3d at 603; DCCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496581\"><a href=\"/opinion/496581/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-v-federal-election-commission/\">831 F.2d at 1133</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nOrloski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472985\"><a href=\"/opinion/472985/richard-j-orloski-v-federal-election-commission/\">795 F.2d at 161</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     Third, Heckler emphasizes that an agency\u2019s non-\nenforcement decision is generally unreviewable because its\nenforcement activity should be \u201ccommitted to an agency\u2019s\nabsolute discretion.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\">470 U.S. at 831</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. That is so because the\nagency must itself assess \u201cwhether agency resources are best\nspent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely\nto succeed if it acts, [and] whether the particular enforcement\naction requested best fits the agency\u2019s overall policies.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nBut judicial review under FECA need not intrude on the\nCommission\u2019s discretion to balance those factors. To the\ncontrary, FECA\u2019s creation of a private right of action means\nthat, if the Commission declines to investigate a complaint that\na court holds legally sufficient to proceed, private citizens may\ntake up the task without the Commission having to use its own\nresources or act under court direction. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(8)(C). For this reason, too, the separation-of-\npowers concerns that animated Heckler (and that my\ncolleagues referenced in New Models I, see 993 F.3d at 888)\nare wholly misplaced in the context of FECA.\n\n    Crucially, the case before us does not raise the question\nwhether there may be some circumstances in which FECA\nauthorizes the Commission to exercise unreviewable\nenforcement discretion. For example, a bipartisan majority of\ncommissioners might be able to shut down the enforcement\nprocess at the reason-to-believe phase by explicitly dismissing\na complaint on enforcement-discretion grounds. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 30109</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1); Guidebook at 12.

J.A. 272 (June 14, 2021,\nVote Certification). And the commissioners never even held\nsuch a vote with respect to the Soft-money Claims. So,\n\f                               13\nassuming a bipartisan majority of the Commission could wield\nunreviewable enforcement discretion, it did not do so in this\ncase. The Act also expressly grants discretion to halt a case if,\nafter the complaint travels through all the prescribed\ncheckpoints, the Commission votes against filing a civil action\nfor relief. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(6)(A).

This case, however,\nstalled out at the very beginning, at the reason-to-believe phase.\nA non-majority incantation of enforcement discretion at that\nphase cannot interfere with the court\u2019s obligation under FECA\nto decide whether the Commission\u2019s inaction or dismissal was\n\u201ccontrary to law\u201d\u2014as it would be, for example, if the\ncommissioners voted to dismiss a complaint that, under the law\nas properly understood, gave \u201creason to believe that the\nrespondent has committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nFECA or the presidential campaign funding laws. Id.\n\u00a7 30109(a)(2), (a)(8)(C).\n\n     All these mistakes have something in common: They\nignore the many ways in which both the Commission and\nFECA\u2019s enforcement scheme are uniquely crafted to avoid\npartisan gridlock. The Supreme Court in Akins appreciated\nhow Congress intended to avoid that gridlock. And, before\nCommission on Hope, we did too.\n\n                               B.\n\n   The majority not only errs by applying Commission on\nHope and New Models; it also misreads the record in this case.\nThe majority rules that \u201cthe controlling commissioners\n\f                               14\nexpressly invoked their prosecutorial discretion when\ndismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj. Op. 9. That is incorrect. The\ncontrolling commissioners were clear in their statement of\nreasons that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. Because the Soft-money Claims\nwere dismissed on the merits, they are reviewable.\n\n     The majority contends that my opinion \u201cmisreads\u201d the\nstatement of reasons, Maj. Op. 11 n.4, but the statement speaks\nfor itself. Over and again, the controlling commissioners made\nclear that they invoked prosecutorial discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims. In the introduction, the controlling\ncommissions explained that they \u201cfound no reason to believe\nthat New Republican violated the soft money rules and\ndismissed the allegations that Scott untimely filed his\ncandidacy and organization paperwork under Heckler v.\nChaney.\u201d       J.A. 282.      In a footnote, the controlling\ncommissioners addressed the Soft-money Claim against Scott:\n\u201cHaving determined there was no path forward on those\nelements, we were required to dismiss\u201d the Soft-money Claim\nbecause that claim \u201cwould have required, at a minimum, a\nthreshold finding that Scott had failed to file a statement of\ncandidacy at the appropriate time, or that New Republican had\nviolated the soft money rules.\u201d J.A. 282 n.2. Later, the\ncontrolling commissioners repeated that \u201cas regards Rick\nScott\u2019s alleged failure to timely file his candidacy and\ncommittee paperwork, we invoked our prosecutorial discretion\npursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A. 290. And, in their\nconclusion, they summarized their votes:\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we voted to find no reason\n    to believe that New Republican violated the soft\n    money ban, exercised our prosecutorial discretion\n    regarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\n    committee failed to timely file candidacy and\n\f                              15\n    organization forms, and dismissed the remaining\n    allegations against the Respondents for lack of\n    evidence.\n\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\n     The controlling commissioners repeatedly tell us that they\nare dismissing the Soft-money claims on the merits, but the\nmajority refuses to take them at their word. It deems the\ndismissal of all four claims unreviewable on the theory that\n\u201cthe controlling commissioners expressly invoked their\nprosecutorial discretion when dismissing the complaint.\u201d Maj.\nOp. 9. There is no basis for that conclusion. The majority\nemphasizes that the controlling commissioners at one point say\nthat they \u201cdetermined that this Matter merited the invocation of\nour prosecutorial discretion.\u201d J.A. 290. The majority appears\nto read \u201cthis Matter\u201d to mean \u201call the claims\u201d in the first\ncomplaint. Maj. Op. 11 n.4. That reading conflicts with what\nthe controlling commissioners actually say. After giving their\nreasons for invoking enforcement discretion, the controlling\ncommissioners clarify the scope of the invocation:\n\u201cAccordingly, as regards Rick Scott\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nfile his candidacy and committee paperwork, we invoked our\nprosecutorial discretion pursuant to Heckler v. Chaney.\u201d J.A.\n290 (emphasis added). And they are even clearer in the\nconclusion, where they invoke prosecutorial discretion only\n\u201cregarding the allegations that Scott and his campaign\ncommittee failed to timely file candidacy and organization\nforms.\u201d J.A. 290-91 (emphasis added). As to the Soft-money\nClaims, they say that they \u201cvoted to find no reason to believe\u201d\nNew Republican violated the soft money ban, and dismissed\nthe Soft-money Claim against Scott for \u201clack of evidence.\u201d\nJ.A. 290-91.\n\f                              16\n     The majority erroneously concludes that End Citizens\nUnited \u201cdid not raise this argument on appeal.\u201d Maj. Op. 11\nn.4. In fact, End Citizens United argued that dismissal of the\nSoft-money Claims was reviewable, Appellant\u2019s Br. 23-24,\nspecifically described that dismissal as based not on\nenforcement discretion but on an erroneous interpretation of\nFECA, id. 18, and confirmed during oral argument that the\ncontrolling commissioners invoked discretion only with\nrespect to the Filing Claims, not the Soft-money Claims, see\nOral Arg. Rec. at 7:43-9:48. The parties drew the same battle\nline in the district court, compare ECU Opp. to MTD 28-29,\nEnd Citizens United PAC v. FEC, No. 21-cv-2128 (D.D.C.\nSept. 16, 2022), ECF No. 25, with New Republican Reply 11,\nECF No. 29, and even New Republican does not assert\nforfeiture here.\n\n     The court has erred in empowering a partisan bloc of\ncommissioners to invoke enforcement discretion to evade\nreview the statute authorizes. Adding to the muddle that error\nhas created, today\u2019s majority relies on the bloc\u2019s discretionary\nreasoning about the Filing Claims to avoid reviewing the other\nclaims in the first complaint. Because the controlling\ncommissioners did not invoke enforcement discretion with\nrespect to the Soft-money Claims, I would hold the dismissal\nof those claims reviewable even under Commission on Hope\nand New Models.\n\n                             ***\n\n     As I have explained, Commission on Hope and New\nModels contravene FECA, ignore binding precedent, and\nundercut the distinctive features Congress crafted to prevent\npartisan gridlock. The majority\u2019s first mistake is to act as if\nthose decisions are \u201cbinding on this panel.\u201d Maj. Op. 12.\n\f                                  17\n     In any event, the majority overstates the reach of those\ncases. 3 It deems the dismissal of the Soft-money Claims\nunreviewable even though the controlling commissioners\nnever invoked prosecutorial discretion with respect to them.\nThat ruling does not follow from Commission on Hope or New\nModels. If our court is going to authorize a non-majority of\ncommissioners to thwart FECA by invoking prosecutorial\ndiscretion, we should take care to do so only where there is an\nactual invocation. I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Indeed, the majority\u2019s premise\u2014that Commission on Hope and\nNew Models govern this case\u2014is itself questionable. Those cases\nare best read as confined to circumstances in which the controlling\ncommissioners invoke prosecutorial discretion for reasons that are\nindependent of their view of the merits of the claim. See New Models\nII, 55 F.4th at 920-21 (Rao, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing\nen banc) (explaining that judicial review was foreclosed \u201c[b]ecause\nthe controlling commissioners relied on an independent ground of\nprosecutorial discretion\u201d); see also, e.g., Campaign Legal Ctr. v.\nFEC, No. 22-5339, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WL 57355</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (D.C.

For the reasons discussed below, we\nGRANT the appellant\u2019s petition for review, REVERSE the initial decision to find\n\n\n1\n   A nonprecedential order is one that the Board has determined does not add\nsignificantly to the body of MSPB case law. Parties may cite nonprecedential orders,\nbut such orders have no precedential value; the Board and administrative judges are not\nrequired to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a\nprecedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\nas significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117(c).\n\f                                                                                2\n\nthat the appellant is entitled to a partial waiver, and REMAND the case to the\nWestern Regional Office for a determination of the proper waiver amount.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n      The appellant was a GS-12, step 4 Airplane Flight Instructor for the\nDepartment of the Air Force, covered under FERS. Initial Appeal File (IAF),\nTab 14 at 35. This is a dual status position, meaning the appellant was required\nas a condition of his employment to maintain membership in the Selected\nReserve. Id. at 38; see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 10216(a)(1)(A), (C); 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 709. The\nappellant satisfied that requirement through his membership in the Alaska Air\nNational Guard. IAF, Tab 14 at 53. However, on May 17, 2015, the appellant\nwas discharged from military service for medical reasons, and because of his loss\nof membership in the Selected Reserve, he was separated from his dual status\ncivilian Airplane Flight Instructor position effective July 10, 2015. IAF, Tab 13\nat 31-32, Tab 14 at 30. The appellant applied for disability retirement, and the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) granted the appellant\u2019s application under\nthe special provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8456. IAF, Tab 14 at 12. The appellant\u2019s\nannuity commenced September 8, 2015, retroactive to the date of his separation.\nIAF, Tab 13 at 9.\n      As OPM informed the appellant at the time of his retirement and each year\nthereafter, if his earned income in any calendar year were to exceed 80% of the\ncurrent salary of the position from which he retired, he would be considered\nrestored to earning capacity, and his disability annuity would cease on June 30,\nthe following year. IAF, Tab 15 at 9, Tab 16 at 8-13; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8455(a)(2);\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.402(a). On the date of his separation from service, the annual\nsalary of the appellant\u2019s Airplane Flight Instructor position was $104,626. IAF,\nTab 14 at 30.\n      The appellant reported his earned income to OPM every year as required,\nincluding on March 12, 2019, when he reported his earned income for 2018 as\n\f                                                                                    3\n\n$100,009. IAF, Tab 13 at 5. Suspecting that his 2018 earned income exceeded\nthe 80% limitation and having heard nothing about it from OPM, in June 2019,\nthe appellant reached out to an OPM official by telephone and left multiple\nvoicemails inquiring about the status of his disability retirement in light of his\n2018 earnings. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74. However, this official never returned the\nappellant\u2019s calls, and even after the June 30 cutoff date had passed, the appellant\ncontinued receiving his regular monthly annuity. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 12 at 28,\nTab 13 at 42.\n      Then, on January 29, 2020, OPM conducted a \u201cSocial Security Earnings\nMatch\u201d on the appellant\u2019s file and determined that the appellant\u2019s 2018 income\nhad exceeded the 80% limitation. IAF, Tab 12 at 49-52. On February 5, 2020,\nOPM notified the appellant of its findings and directed him to file certain\ndocumentation to verify his 2018 earned income. 2 Id. at 39-40. OPM further\ninformed the appellant that his 80% earnings limitation for 2018 was $88,440,\nand that if his 2018 earned income exceeded that amount, his annuity would be\nterminated retroactively and he would be responsible for repaying any\noverpayment.    Id. at 39-40.    On February 14, 2020, the appellant responded,\nconfirming his 2018 earned income and inquiring as to whether any overpayment\ncould be waived under the circumstances. Id. at 44-45.\n      On March 9, 2020, OPM terminated the appellant\u2019s annuity retroactive to\nJune 30, 2019. IAF, Tab 12 at 25, 35. On April 7, 2020, OPM informed the\nappellant that he had been overpaid a net $25,855.65 in disability retirement\nannuity benefits, which OPM intended to collect.         Id. at 25.    The appellant\nrequested reconsideration, and on July 1, 2020, OPM issued a final decision,\naffirming its initial decision as to the existence and amount of the overpayment,\n\n2\n  Unaware that this problem was caused by its own oversight, OPM was under the\nimpression that the appellant had misreported his 2018 earned income. IAF, Tab 12\nat 39. In fact, the appellant\u2019s self-report of 2018 earned income matched exactly with\nwhat OPM belatedly discovered through a search of his Social Security records. IAF,\nTab 11 at 5, Tab 12 at 51.\n\f                                                                                    4\n\nand proposing to collect the overpayment in monthly installments of $250.         Id.\nat 5-16.\n      The appellant filed a Board appeal in which he did not challenge the\nexistence or amount of the overpayment but instead sought a waiver. IAF, Tab 1\nat 3-5.    He waived his right to a hearing, and the appeal was decided on the\nwritten record. IAF, Tabs 23-24.\n      After the close of the record, the administrative judge issued an initial\ndecision affirming OPM\u2019s final decision. IAF, Tab 26, Initial Decision (ID). He\nfound that, although the appellant was without fault in creating the overpayment,\nthere was no basis to grant his request for a waiver because recovery would not\nbe against equity and good conscience. ID at 11-25. The administrative judge\nnoted that the appellant was also attempting to contest OPM\u2019s retroactive\ncancellation of his health insurance, which had caused him to incur thousands of\ndollars in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, as well as a statement in OPM\u2019s\ndecision letter that he would be ineligible for reinstatement of annuity even if his\nearned income fell below the 80% limitation in the future. ID at 7, 9; IAF, Tab 3\nat 12, Tab 12 at 6.    However, the administrative judge found that the Board\nlacked jurisdiction over these matters in the context of the instant appeal. ID at 9.\n      The appellant has filed a petition for review, disputing the administrative\njudge\u2019s overpayment waiver analysis, as well as his jurisdictional finding\nconcerning the termination of his health insurance. Petition for Review (PFR)\nFile, Tab 1. OPM has responded to the petition for review, and the appellant has\nfiled a reply to OPM\u2019s response. PFR File, Tabs 3-4.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n      Before proceeding to the issues of overpayment and waiver, we first\naddress the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s decision to terminate the appellant\u2019s\nhealth insurance coverage. In his initial decision, the administrative judge found\nthat the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider claims concerning Federal employee\n\f                                                                                        5\n\nhealth insurance benefits.        ID at 9; see Hudson v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 114 M.S.P.R. 669, \u00b6 10 (2010).               On petition for review, the\nappellant cites Chamblin v. Office of Personnel Management, 112 M.S.P.R. 266,\n\u00b6\u00b6 11-13 (2009), arguing that there are certain exceptions to this general rule,\nincluding situations in which the appellant is seeking waiver of an overpayment\ncaused by the retroactive application of insurance premiums. PFR File, Tab 1\nat 10-11.\n      The appellant is correct that the Board may have jurisdiction over health\ninsurance benefits decisions in this context. See Mitchell v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, \u00b6 12 (2004). However, the overpayment in this\ncase did not result from the retroactive application of health insurance premiums,\nand in fact, OPM reduced the amount of the overpayment by retroactively\ndeducting those premiums from the overpayment amount. IAF, Tab 12 at 25, 28.\nMoreover, even if this exception did apply, the Board would still lack jurisdiction\nover OPM\u2019s decision on the appellant\u2019s health insurance benefits per se and\nwould consider the matter only insofar as it bears on the issue of whether\ncollection of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience. See\nMitchell, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. We therefore find no basis to disturb the\nadministrative judge\u2019s finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s\ndecision to retroactively terminate the appellant\u2019s health insurance coverage. 3\nID at 9.\n      Despite finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over OPM\u2019s health\ninsurance benefits decision per se, consistent with the Board\u2019s holdings in\nChamblin and Mitchell, the administrative judge went on to consider the\nconsequences of this health insurance decision in the context of waiver.               ID\n\n3\n  Although the appellant does not contest this finding on review, we likewise agree with\nthe administrative judge that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the\nappellant\u2019s disability retirement could be reinstated if his income were to fall below the\n80% limitation in the future. ID at 9; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(h) (\u201cThe Board shall not\nissue advisory opinions.\u201d).\n\f                                                                                       6\n\nat 23-24. We likewise consider this matter in the context of our waiver analysis\nbelow.\n      OPM bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence the existence\nand amount of an annuity overpayment.                Vojas v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 115 M.S.P.R. 502, \u00b6 10 (2011); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(b)(2)(ii).\nBecause the appellant was restored to earning capacity as of December 31, 2018,\nhis disability retirement annuity should have ceased effective June 30, 2019. See\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8455(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.402(a). Because OPM continued to pay the\nannuity through February 2020 (eight extra monthly annuity payments), the\nappellant received an overpayment of annuity. IAF, Tab 7 at 23; see Ruskin v.\nOffice of Personnel Management, 73 M.S.P.R. 544, 547, 551 (1997).                   The\nappellant does not dispute OPM\u2019s calculation that the net overpayment amounted\nto $25,855.65.    IAF, Tab 11 at 9, Tab 12 at 5, 28.         This calculation appears\ncorrect on its face, and we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge\u2019s\nfinding that OPM proved the existence and the amount of the overpayment. ID\nat 10-11.\n      An overpayment of FERS annuity is subject to recovery under the\nprovisions of 5 C.F.R. part 845, subpart B. However, recovery of an overpayment\nmay not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of OPM, the\nindividual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good\nconscience. 4 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301. The appellant bears the\nburden of establishing his entitlement to a waiver by substantial evidence.\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.307(b), 1201.56(b)(2)(ii). For the reasons explained in the initial\ndecision, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was without\nfault in causing the overpayment, and OPM does not dispute this finding on\n\n4\n  The regulatory standards for waiver of overpayments under FERS are substantially\nsimilar, and indeed almost identical, to those under the Civil Service Retirement System\n(CSRS). Compare 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart N, with 5 C.F.R. part 845, subpart C. We\nfind the case law interpreting the CSRS regulations to be instructive in interpreting the\nFERS regulations.\n\f                                                                                  7\n\nreview. ID at 12-14. Therefore, the only remaining issue regarding waiver of the\noverpayment is whether recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\n      OPM\u2019s regulations set forth three circumstances under which recovery\nwould be against equity and good conscience\u2014financial hardship, detrimental\nreliance, and unconscionability.      5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.303.      In this case, the\nadministrative judge found that the appellant was seeking waiver on the bases of\ndetrimental reliance and unconscionability. ID at 17-18. However, he found that\nthe appellant knew or suspected that he was receiving erroneous payments from\nOPM, and was therefore obligated to set these payments aside pending resolution\nof the matter. ID at 18-22. Because the set-aside rule applied in this case, the\nadministrative judge found that only exceptional circumstances involving\nextremely egregious delays or errors by OPM would entitle the appellant to a\nwaiver.   ID at 22.   The administrative judge considered the nature of OPM\u2019s\nerrors, the length of the delays involved in correcting the overpayment, and the\ncircumstances surrounding the appellant\u2019s loss of health insurance, but he found\nthat these did not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances that would\nwarrant a waiver of the overpayment. ID at 22-25. The appellant disputes these\nfindings on review.\n      First, we address the appellant\u2019s argument that the set-aside rule should not\napply in his case. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-10. Under section I.C.4 of OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments, an individual who suspects an\noverpayment and promptly notifies OPM of the matter is required to set the\nmoney aside pending recovery by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15; see Slater v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 510, 516-17 (1989). This is known as the\n\u201cset-aside rule,\u201d and the collection of money subject to this rule is not against\nequity and good conscience absent exceptional circumstances involving extremely\negregious errors or delays by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15. The appellant argues that\nthe set-aside rule should not apply in his case because it was not reasonable to\nexpect him to calculate the 80% earning limitation, considering that this is OPM\u2019s\n\f                                                                                   8\n\njob and he did not have sufficient information to make an accurate calculation\nhimself. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-7. He further argues that he acted diligently by\ninquiring about the matter to OPM, and that he reasonably interpreted OPM\u2019s\nunresponsiveness as an indication that his 2018 income did not exceed the 80%\nlimitation. Id. at 7-10.\n      We agree with the appellant\u2019s argument.        As the administrative judge\ncorrectly found, regardless of whether the appellant should reasonably have\nsuspected that he exceeded the 80% income limitation for 2018, he did in fact\nsuspect this, as evidenced by his own admissions and his follow-up telephone\ncalls to OPM. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 17 at 15. However, this is not the end of the\nmatter. The appellant\u2019s suspicion was not that he had received an overpayment\nbut that he had exceeded the 80% income limitation and that his annuity would\ntherefore be terminated in the future; the appellant had not actually received any\noverpayment of annuity until the month after he left OPM two voicemails about\nthe situation. In this regard, we find substantial evidence that the appellant acted\nin a reasonably prudent manner by timely and accurately reporting his 2018\nincome to OPM and then following up with OPM when he had not gotten notice\nthat his annuity would be terminated. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74, Tab 13 at 5.\n      Furthermore, the appellant reasonably directed his follow-up inquiries to\nthe telephone number listed by the OPM official who had previously responded to\nthe appellant about another matter concerning his disability retirement annuity.\nIAF, Tab 3 at 74, Tab 12 at 23.      Therefore, regardless of what the appellant\nsuspected or should have suspected based on his 2018 income alone, by the time\nhe actually started receiving the annuity overpayment, things had changed\nbecause OPM had remained persistently silent about the appellant\u2019s annuity status\ndespite his multiple inquiries, thus leading him to believe that there was not any\nproblem with his annuity. As the appellant accurately points out, OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines specifically state that a determination of whether an individual \u201cknew\u201d\nor \u201cshould have known\u201d something should account for \u201cwhether OPM failed to\n\f                                                                                       9\n\nrespond to an inquiry by the debtor as to the correctness of payment(s) and, thus,\ncaused the debtor to reasonably believe that the payment(s) was correct.\u201d PFR\nFile, Tab 1 at 9, Tab 17 at 11-12. Based on the facts above, we find substantial\nevidence to support the appellant\u2019s claim that, despite his earlier suspicions,\nOPM\u2019s failure to respond to his multiple inquiries led him to reasonably assume\nthat he was still eligible for disability retirement benefits. IAF, Tab 6 at 6-7.\n      We acknowledge that the appellant could perhaps have done more by\npersisting in his inquiries to OPM until he received a definitive answer one way\nor the other.   However, this is a level of persistence not required by OPM\u2019s\nGuidelines.     IAF, Tab 17 at 12.        Furthermore, we find that it would be\ninappropriate to place such a level of responsibility on a disability retirement\nannuitant because he is not responsible for administering his own annuity, and he\nshould be entitled to presume that OPM would not likely create an overpayment\nsituation by failing to take note of his income report both when he filed it and\nwhen he contacted OPM multiple times to ask about it. For these reasons, we\nfind substantial evidence that, by the time the appellant began receiving an\nannuity overpayment in July 2019, he no longer reasonably suspected that his\nannuity was continuing in error, and that the set -aside rule does not apply. 5 See\nWright v. Office of Personnel Management, 105 M.S.P.R. 419, \u00b6 5 (2007).\n      We emphasize that the appellant\u2019s burden of proving entitlement to waiver\nof an annuity overpayment is by substantial evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.307(b),\n1201.56(b)(2)(ii). This is a lower standard of proof than preponderance of the\nevidence and is defined as \u201c[t]he degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable\nperson, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a\n5\n  The appellant argues in the alternative that, even if the rule applies, waiver is still\nwarranted due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d PFR File, Tab 1 at 16-26; IAF, Tab 17\nat 15; see James v. Office of Personnel Management, 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 217 (1996)\n(explaining that collection of monies subject to the set-aside rule may be waived only in\nexceptional circumstances). Because we have found that the set-aside rule does not\napply, we decline to make any findings on this issue. However, we have considered the\nappellant\u2019s arguments in this regard to the extent that they bear on whether collection\nwould be unconscionable under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c).\n\f                                                                                  10\n\nconclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree.\u201d           5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1201.4(p). Even if the evidence could be interpreted another way, that does not\nmean that the interpretation discussed in paragraphs 17-19 above is not also\nreasonable. This is all that is required for the appellant to carry his burden on the\nissue of waiver. See In re Jolley, 308 F.3d 1317, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cIf the\nevidence in record will support several reasonable but contradictory conclusions,\nwe will not find the Board\u2019s decision unsupported by substantial evidence simply\nbecause the Board chose one conclusion over another plausible alternative.\u201d).\n      Because the set-aside rule does not apply, we now consider whether\nrecovery would be against equity and good conscience under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301,\non the bases of financial hardship, detrimental reliance, or unconscionability. See\nHarrison v. Office of Personnel Management, 57 M.S.P.R. 89, 94-95 & n.5\n(1993). Regarding financial hardship, although the appellant argues that he has\nbeen financially damaged by OPM\u2019s delay in terminating his annuity, we do not\nconstrue this as an argument that collection of the overpayment would result in\n\u201cfinancial hardship\u201d within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.301(a) and 845.304,\ni.e., that he lacks the means to repay the debt without impoverishing himself.\nIAF, Tab 17 at 16-19.\n      Nor do we find that the appellant is entitled to wavier under 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 845.301(c) on the basis of unconscionability. Consistent with OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, the Board has found that the unconscionability criterion is a high\nstandard that will only be met under exceptional circumstances.         IAF, Tab 17\nat 21-22; see Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549\n(1989). Because the concept of unconscionability is generally defined in terms of\nbroad, equitable considerations, the Board will consider all relevant factors using\na \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d approach in order to determine whether recovery\nof an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case. Id. at 550.\n      The appellant cites to OPM\u2019s multiple failures to take note of his 2018\nearnings and its consequent delay in terminating his annuity, as well as OPM\u2019s\n\f                                                                                      11\n\naccusations of fraud and attempts to blame him for the overpayment. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 16-29. However, OPM\u2019s delay in terminating the appellant\u2019s annuity\nand notifying him of the overpayment was less than a year. IAF, Tab 12 at 25,\n35. Although this delay was unfortunate, we find that it was not so egregiously\nexcessive as to meet the high standard of unconscionability in 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 845.301(c). 6    See also Newcomb v. Office of Personnel Management,\n42 M.S.P.R. 552, 554, 559 (finding that OPM\u2019s delay of less than 2 years in\ndiscovering an overpayment did not render collection unconscionable); cf. Estate\nof Konschak v. Office of Personnel Management, 84 M.S.P.R. 555, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14\n(1999) (finding that OPM\u2019s 22-year delay in discovering an overpayment of more\nthan $100,000 rendered collection of that amount from an 82-year old annuitant\nunconscionable).    As for OPM\u2019s recriminations against him, the appellant no\ndoubt found these to be both insulting and frustrating. However, we agree with\nthe administrative judge that there is insufficient basis to conclude that OPM\u2019s\naccusations were knowingly false, and in any event, this error was without\nconsequence to the appeal. ID at 22. The appellant has suffered no tangible harm\nfrom OPM\u2019s erroneous attribution of fault.          Nor do there appear to be any\nextenuating circumstances such as advanced age or mental disability that might\nweigh in favor of a finding of unconscionability. For the reasons explained in the\ninitial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that the totality of the\ncircumstances do not support a finding that recovery would be unconscionable\nunder the circumstances. 7 ID at 22-25.\n\n6\n  In making this determination, we have considered that the delays involved in this case\nare far shorter than the 4 years necessary to carry a presumption of unconscionability\nunder OPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines. IAF, Tab 17 at 22; see Newcomb v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 42 M.S.P.R. 552, 558-59 (1989).\n7\n  The administrative judge made this finding in the context of his analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed to warrant waiver of the overpayment\nnotwithstanding the set-aside rule. ID at 22-25. However, under OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, the standard for waiver notwithstanding the set-aside rule is similar to the\nstandard for waiver based on unconscionability. IAF, Tab 17 at 15, 21-22. Therefore,\nwe find that the administrative judge\u2019s analysis was not inconsistent with an analysis of\n\f                                                                                   12\n\n      Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we agree with the appellant that he\nis entitled to a partial waiver of the overpayment based on detrimental reliance\nunder 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c). PFR File, Tab 1 at 11-16. Under OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines, detrimental reliance occurs when the overpayment recipient\nrelinquishes a valuable right or changes positions for the worse because of the\nerroneous payment or because of notice that such payment would be made. IAF,\nTab 17 at 19. To justify waiver, the loss of right or change of position must be\ndirectly caused by the overpayment or notice of payment, detrimental to the\nrecipient, material, and irrevocable.    Id.   OPM defines \u201cvaluable right\u201d as a\nprivilege, claim, entitlement, or benefit that has monetary worth.           Id.   An\nindividual changes positions for the worse when he is left in a worse financial\nposition after recovery than he was prior to his receipt of the overpayment. Id.\nat 20. The concepts of losing a valuable right and changing positions for the\nworse can often simultaneously apply to the same situation. Id.\n      In this case, we find that the overpayment of annuity directly caused the\nappellant to relinquish the valuable right of employer-sponsored health insurance.\nAs the appellant explains it, if OPM had notified him in timely manner that his\ndisability retirement benefits were going to be terminated, he would have\npurchased employer-sponsored health insurance in July 2019.             IAF, Tab 6\nat 13-14. However, relying on OPM\u2019s failure to terminate his annuity and its\nsilence in the face of his multiple inquiries, the appellant believed that his Federal\nhealth insurance benefits would continue, and so he did not purchase alternative\ninsurance at that time.   Id. Believing that he was still covered under Federal\nhealth insurance benefits, the appellant continued to incur healthcare expenses\nover the following months, and his medical bills continued to be paid by his\ninsurance, which had not yet been canceled.         Then, when OPM retroactively\ncancelled the appellant\u2019s Federal health insurance benefits on March 9, 2020, his\n\nwhether exceptional circumstances existed so as to warrant waiver of the overpayment\non unconscionability grounds under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(c).\n\f                                                                                      13\n\nformer insurer sought reimbursement from providers for all the claims that he had\nmade since August 2019, 8 resulting in $5,451.95 in uninsured healthcare liability\nfor the appellant. IAF, Tab 3 at 12, 51, 62-73.\n      Furthermore, the appellant has shown that the timing of OPM\u2019s actions\nrendered him unable, as a practical matter, to obtain employer-sponsored health\ninsurance for the 17-month period from between August 2019 and January 2021.\nIAF, Tab 3 at 7. Specifically, health insurance open enrollment at the appellant\u2019s\nemployer occurs in the fall, and coverage begins the following January. PFR\nFile, Tab 1 at 12. To obtain coverage outside that period, an individual must\nenroll within 31 days of a qualifying life event.        IAF, Tab 3 at 13, 53.      The\nappellant\u2019s loss of Federal health insurance constituted a qualifying life event, but\ndue to its retroactive nature, the appellant was not apprised of it until well after\nthe 31-day window had passed, and his employer denied the appellant\u2019s\nApril 2020 application for out-of-season enrollment for that reason. Id. at 54-61.\nBecause the 2019 open enrollment season had already passed by the time OPM\ninformed the appellant about his retroactive loss of coverage, the appellant\u2019s next\nopportunity to enroll with his employer was in the 2020 open season, for\ncoverage beginning January 1, 2021. PFR File, Tab 1 at 12.\n      Turning to the criteria set forth in OPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines for waiver\nbased on the loss of a valuable right, IAF, Tab 17 at 19, for the reasons explained\nabove, we find that employer-sponsored health insurance is a valuable right and\nthat the appellant\u2019s decision to forego it is directly attributable to the\noverpayment of annuity. 9     We also find that the appellant\u2019s relinquishment of\nemployer-sponsored health insurance was materially detrimental to his financial\n8\n  This accounts for the June 30, 2019 termination of the appellant\u2019s coverage, as well as\na 31-day extension that allowed his claims to be covered through July 2019. IAF, Tab 3\nat 51.\n9\n  We note that the appellant\u2019s Federal health insurance premiums were paid for by\ndeductions from his disability retirement annuity and that his eligibility for Federal\nhealth insurance benefits was inextricably linked to his status as an annuitant. See\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306(a)(1).\n\f                                                                                   14\n\nsituation because it resulted in a financial loss to him in the form of substantial\nout-of-pocket medical expenses that would otherwise have been paid by his\ninsurer. We further find that the relinquishment of this benefit is irrevocable, as\nwe are unaware of any mechanism for obtaining retroactive health insurance\ncoverage. We therefore find that the appellant has proven by substantial evidence\nthat he is entitled to waiver under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(b) on the basis of his loss\nof a valuable right.      IAF, Tab 17 at 19; see King v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, 730 F.3d 1342, 1348-51 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Observing that, after\ncollection of the overpayment, the appellant will be left in a worse financial\nposition than if he had never received the overpayment in the first place, we also\nfind that the appellant is entitled to waiver under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301(b) because\nhe has changed his position for the worse. IAF, Tab 17 at 20; see Gromo v.\nOffice of Personnel Management, 944 F.2d 882, 884-85 (1991).\n         Nevertheless, because the appellant\u2019s claimed financial losses of $5,451.95\nrepresent a relatively small part of the total overpayment amount, we find that it\nwould be inappropriate to grant a waiver for the entire $25,855.65. According to\nOPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines, the amount of the waiver should depend on the degree\nto which the individual\u2019s position was changed for the worse, and a partial waiver\nmay be granted that appropriately reflects the degree of detrimental reliance.\nIAF, Tab 17 at 20-21; see Fearon v. Office of Personnel Management,\n109 M.S.P.R. 606, \u00b6 5 (2008). In this case, we find that it would be appropriate\nto grant a partial waiver of the overpayment, such that the appellant will not\nrealize a windfall but will still not be in a worse financial position due to his loss\nof health insurance coverage fairly attributable to OPM\u2019s error.\n         Nevertheless, the precise amount of the waiver that should be granted is not\nclear from the extant record.      The appellant below stated that the retroactive\ntermination of his annuity resulted in $5,451.95 in extra uncovered healthcare\nexpenses for him, and he has provided some documentation to substantiate his\nclaim.     IAF, Tab 3 at 12, 51, 62-73.      However, on petition for review, the\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nappellant appears to be claiming a total of $5,600 in extra expenses. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 14. Furthermore, it does not seem that the appellant deducted from this\ntotal the healthcare premiums that he would have otherwise been paying through\nhis employer if OPM had timely notified him of the termination of his annuity.\nNor is it clear to us whether the appellant\u2019s claimed amount represents only the\nperiod of retroactivity or whether it also encompasses uncovered healthcare\nexpenses that he may have incurred between March 9, 2020, and the\ncommencement of his employer-sponsored insurance on January 1, 2021.            For\nthese reasons, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for the administrative\njudge to take relevant evidence and argument and decide on an appropriate partial\nwaiver amount in the first instance. This might be a rather complex calculation\nwith many factors involved and may require a considerable amount of judgment\nand discretion. Therefore, the parties are strongly encouraged to cooperate in\ngood faith and, if possible, arrive at a mutually agreeable figure to present to the\nadministrative judge.\n\n                                     ORDER\n      For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the Western\nRegional Office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                        ______________________________\n                                      Jennifer Everling\n                                      Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n                   MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD\n\n\nJAMES D.

Initial Appeal File (IAF),\nTab 14 at 35. This is a dual status position, meaning the appellant was required\nas a condition of his employment to maintain membership in the Selected\nReserve. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 38</span><pre class=\"inline\">; see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 10216</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1)(A), (C); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">32 U.S.C. \u00a7 709</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The\nappellant satisfied that requirement through his membership in the Alaska Air\nNational Guard. IAF, Tab 14 at 53. However, on May 17, 2015, the appellant\nwas discharged from military service for medical reasons, and because of his loss\nof membership in the Selected Reserve, he was separated from his dual status\ncivilian Airplane Flight Instructor position effective July 10, 2015. IAF, Tab 13\nat 31-32, Tab 14 at 30. The appellant applied for disability retirement, and the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) granted the appellant\u2019s application under\nthe special provisions of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8456</span><pre class=\"inline\">. IAF, Tab 14 at 12. The appellant\u2019s\nannuity commenced September 8, 2015, retroactive to the date of his separation.\nIAF, Tab 13 at 9.\n      As OPM informed the appellant at the time of his retirement and each year\nthereafter, if his earned income in any calendar year were to exceed 80% of the\ncurrent salary of the position from which he retired, he would be considered\nrestored to earning capacity, and his disability annuity would cease on June 30,\nthe following year. IAF, Tab 15 at 9, Tab 16 at 8-13; see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8455</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2);\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.402</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a). On the date of his separation from service, the annual\nsalary of the appellant\u2019s Airplane Flight Instructor position was $104,626. IAF,\nTab 14 at 30.\n      The appellant reported his earned income to OPM every year as required,\nincluding on March 12, 2019, when he reported his earned income for 2018 as\n\f                                                                                    3\n\n$100,009. IAF, Tab 13 at 5. Suspecting that his 2018 earned income exceeded\nthe 80% limitation and having heard nothing about it from OPM, in June 2019,\nthe appellant reached out to an OPM official by telephone and left multiple\nvoicemails inquiring about the status of his disability retirement in light of his\n2018 earnings. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74. However, this official never returned the\nappellant\u2019s calls, and even after the June 30 cutoff date had passed, the appellant\ncontinued receiving his regular monthly annuity. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 12 at 28,\nTab 13 at 42.\n      Then, on January 29, 2020, OPM conducted a \u201cSocial Security Earnings\nMatch\u201d on the appellant\u2019s file and determined that the appellant\u2019s 2018 income\nhad exceeded the 80% limitation. IAF, Tab 12 at 49-52. On February 5, 2020,\nOPM notified the appellant of its findings and directed him to file certain\ndocumentation to verify his 2018 earned income. 2 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 39-40</span><pre class=\"inline\">. OPM further\ninformed the appellant that his 80% earnings limitation for 2018 was $88,440,\nand that if his 2018 earned income exceeded that amount, his annuity would be\nterminated retroactively and he would be responsible for repaying any\noverpayment.    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 39-40</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

IAF, Tab 12 at 25, 35. On April 7, 2020, OPM informed the\nappellant that he had been overpaid a net $25,855.65 in disability retirement\nannuity benefits, which OPM intended to collect.         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 25</span><pre class=\"inline\">.    The appellant\nrequested reconsideration, and on July 1, 2020, OPM issued a final decision,\naffirming its initial decision as to the existence and amount of the overpayment,\n\n2\n  Unaware that this problem was caused by its own oversight, OPM was under the\nimpression that the appellant had misreported his 2018 earned income. IAF, Tab 12\nat 39. In fact, the appellant\u2019s self-report of 2018 earned income matched exactly with\nwhat OPM belatedly discovered through a search of his Social Security records. IAF,\nTab 11 at 5, Tab 12 at 51.\n\f                                                                                    4\n\nand proposing to collect the overpayment in monthly installments of $250.         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\nat 5-16</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n      The appellant filed a Board appeal in which he did not challenge the\nexistence or amount of the overpayment but instead sought a waiver. IAF, Tab 1\nat 3-5.    He waived his right to a hearing, and the appeal was decided on the\nwritten record. IAF, Tabs 23-24.\n      After the close of the record, the administrative judge issued an initial\ndecision affirming OPM\u2019s final decision. IAF, Tab 26, Initial Decision (ID). He\nfound that, although the appellant was without fault in creating the overpayment,\nthere was no basis to grant his request for a waiver because recovery would not\nbe against equity and good conscience. ID at 11-25. The administrative judge\nnoted that the appellant was also attempting to contest OPM\u2019s retroactive\ncancellation of his health insurance, which had caused him to incur thousands of\ndollars in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, as well as a statement in OPM\u2019s\ndecision letter that he would be ineligible for reinstatement of annuity even if his\nearned income fell below the 80% limitation in the future. ID at 7, 9; IAF, Tab 3\nat 12, Tab 12 at 6.    However, the administrative judge found that the Board\nlacked jurisdiction over these matters in the context of the instant appeal. ID at 9.\n      The appellant has filed a petition for review, disputing the administrative\njudge\u2019s overpayment waiver analysis, as well as his jurisdictional finding\nconcerning the termination of his health insurance. Petition for Review (PFR)\nFile, Tab 1. OPM has responded to the petition for review, and the appellant has\nfiled a reply to OPM\u2019s response.

In this case, the\nadministrative judge found that the appellant was seeking waiver on the bases of\ndetrimental reliance and unconscionability. ID at 17-18. However, he found that\nthe appellant knew or suspected that he was receiving erroneous payments from\nOPM, and was therefore obligated to set these payments aside pending resolution\nof the matter. ID at 18-22. Because the set-aside rule applied in this case, the\nadministrative judge found that only exceptional circumstances involving\nextremely egregious delays or errors by OPM would entitle the appellant to a\nwaiver.   ID at 22.   The administrative judge considered the nature of OPM\u2019s\nerrors, the length of the delays involved in correcting the overpayment, and the\ncircumstances surrounding the appellant\u2019s loss of health insurance, but he found\nthat these did not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances that would\nwarrant a waiver of the overpayment. ID at 22-25. The appellant disputes these\nfindings on review.\n      First, we address the appellant\u2019s argument that the set-aside rule should not\napply in his case. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-10. Under section I.C.4 of OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments, an individual who suspects an\noverpayment and promptly notifies OPM of the matter is required to set the\nmoney aside pending recovery by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15; see Slater v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 M.S.P.R. 510</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516-17 (1989). This is known as the\n\u201cset-aside rule,\u201d and the collection of money subject to this rule is not against\nequity and good conscience absent exceptional circumstances involving extremely\negregious errors or delays by OPM. IAF, Tab 17 at 15. The appellant argues that\nthe set-aside rule should not apply in his case because it was not reasonable to\nexpect him to calculate the 80% earning limitation, considering that this is OPM\u2019s\n\f                                                                                   8\n\njob and he did not have sufficient information to make an accurate calculation\nhimself. PFR File, Tab 1 at 5-7. He further argues that he acted diligently by\ninquiring about the matter to OPM, and that he reasonably interpreted OPM\u2019s\nunresponsiveness as an indication that his 2018 income did not exceed the 80%\nlimitation. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 7-10</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n      We agree with the appellant\u2019s argument.        As the administrative judge\ncorrectly found, regardless of whether the appellant should reasonably have\nsuspected that he exceeded the 80% income limitation for 2018, he did in fact\nsuspect this, as evidenced by his own admissions and his follow-up telephone\ncalls to OPM. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, Tab 17 at 15. However, this is not the end of the\nmatter. The appellant\u2019s suspicion was not that he had received an overpayment\nbut that he had exceeded the 80% income limitation and that his annuity would\ntherefore be terminated in the future; the appellant had not actually received any\noverpayment of annuity until the month after he left OPM two voicemails about\nthe situation. In this regard, we find substantial evidence that the appellant acted\nin a reasonably prudent manner by timely and accurately reporting his 2018\nincome to OPM and then following up with OPM when he had not gotten notice\nthat his annuity would be terminated. IAF, Tab 3 at 6, 74, Tab 13 at 5.\n      Furthermore, the appellant reasonably directed his follow-up inquiries to\nthe telephone number listed by the OPM official who had previously responded to\nthe appellant about another matter concerning his disability retirement annuity.\nIAF, Tab 3 at 74, Tab 12 at 23.      Therefore, regardless of what the appellant\nsuspected or should have suspected based on his 2018 income alone, by the time\nhe actually started receiving the annuity overpayment, things had changed\nbecause OPM had remained persistently silent about the appellant\u2019s annuity status\ndespite his multiple inquiries, thus leading him to believe that there was not any\nproblem with his annuity. As the appellant accurately points out, OPM\u2019s Policy\nGuidelines specifically state that a determination of whether an individual \u201cknew\u201d\nor \u201cshould have known\u201d something should account for \u201cwhether OPM failed to\n\f                                                                                       9\n\nrespond to an inquiry by the debtor as to the correctness of payment(s) and, thus,\ncaused the debtor to reasonably believe that the payment(s) was correct.\u201d PFR\nFile, Tab 1 at 9, Tab 17 at 11-12. Based on the facts above, we find substantial\nevidence to support the appellant\u2019s claim that, despite his earlier suspicions,\nOPM\u2019s failure to respond to his multiple inquiries led him to reasonably assume\nthat he was still eligible for disability retirement benefits. IAF, Tab 6 at 6-7.\n      We acknowledge that the appellant could perhaps have done more by\npersisting in his inquiries to OPM until he received a definitive answer one way\nor the other.   However, this is a level of persistence not required by OPM\u2019s\nGuidelines.     IAF, Tab 17 at 12.        Furthermore, we find that it would be\ninappropriate to place such a level of responsibility on a disability retirement\nannuitant because he is not responsible for administering his own annuity, and he\nshould be entitled to presume that OPM would not likely create an overpayment\nsituation by failing to take note of his income report both when he filed it and\nwhen he contacted OPM multiple times to ask about it. For these reasons, we\nfind substantial evidence that, by the time the appellant began receiving an\nannuity overpayment in July 2019, he no longer reasonably suspected that his\nannuity was continuing in error, and that the set -aside rule does not apply. 5 See\nWright v. Office of Personnel Management, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">105 M.S.P.R. 419</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 5 (2007).\n      We emphasize that the appellant\u2019s burden of proving entitlement to waiver\nof an annuity overpayment is by substantial evidence. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 845.307</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b),\n1201.56(b)(2)(ii).

The\nappellant\u2019s loss of Federal health insurance constituted a qualifying life event, but\ndue to its retroactive nature, the appellant was not apprised of it until well after\nthe 31-day window had passed, and his employer denied the appellant\u2019s\nApril 2020 application for out-of-season enrollment for that reason. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 54-61</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nBecause the 2019 open enrollment season had already passed by the time OPM\ninformed the appellant about his retroactive loss of coverage, the appellant\u2019s next\nopportunity to enroll with his employer was in the 2020 open season, for\ncoverage beginning January 1, 2021.

IAF, Tab 3\nat 51.\n9\n  We note that the appellant\u2019s Federal health insurance premiums were paid for by\ndeductions from his disability retirement annuity and that his eligibility for Federal\nhealth insurance benefits was inextricably linked to his status as an annuitant. See\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.306</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1).\n\f                                                                                   14\n\nsituation because it resulted in a financial loss to him in the form of substantial\nout-of-pocket medical expenses that would otherwise have been paid by his\ninsurer. We further find that the relinquishment of this benefit is irrevocable, as\nwe are unaware of any mechanism for obtaining retroactive health insurance\ncoverage. We therefore find that the appellant has proven by substantial evidence\nthat he is entitled to waiver under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b) on the basis of his loss\nof a valuable right.      IAF, Tab 17 at 19; see King v. Office of Personnel\nManagement, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1040711\"><a href=\"/opinion/1040711/king-v-office-of-personnel-management/\">730 F.3d 1342</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1348-51 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Observing that, after\ncollection of the overpayment, the appellant will be left in a worse financial\nposition than if he had never received the overpayment in the first place, we also\nfind that the appellant is entitled to waiver under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b) because\nhe has changed his position for the worse. IAF, Tab 17 at 20; see Gromo v.\nOffice of Personnel Management, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568067\"><a href=\"/opinion/568067/louis-l-gromo-v-office-of-personnel-management/\">944 F.2d 882</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 884-85 (1991).\n         Nevertheless, because the appellant\u2019s claimed financial losses of $5,451.95\nrepresent a relatively small part of the total overpayment amount, we find that it\nwould be inappropriate to grant a waiver for the entire $25,855.65. According to\nOPM\u2019s Policy Guidelines, the amount of the waiver should depend on the degree\nto which the individual\u2019s position was changed for the worse, and a partial waiver\nmay be granted that appropriately reflects the degree of detrimental reliance.\nIAF, Tab 17 at 20-21; see Fearon v. Office of Personnel Management,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">109 M.S.P.R. 606</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 5 (2008). In this case, we find that it would be appropriate\nto grant a partial waiver of the overpayment, such that the appellant will not\nrealize a windfall but will still not be in a worse financial position due to his loss\nof health insurance coverage fairly attributable to OPM\u2019s error.\n         Nevertheless, the precise amount of the waiver that should be granted is not\nclear from the extant record.      The appellant below stated that the retroactive\ntermination of his annuity resulted in $5,451.95 in extra uncovered healthcare\nexpenses for him, and he has provided some documentation to substantiate his\nclaim.     IAF, Tab 3 at 12, 51, 62-73.      However, on petition for review, the\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nappellant appears to be claiming a total of $5,600 in extra expenses. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 14. Furthermore, it does not seem that the appellant deducted from this\ntotal the healthcare premiums that he would have otherwise been paying through\nhis employer if OPM had timely notified him of the termination of his annuity.\nNor is it clear to us whether the appellant\u2019s claimed amount represents only the\nperiod of retroactivity or whether it also encompasses uncovered healthcare\nexpenses that he may have incurred between March 9, 2020, and the\ncommencement of his employer-sponsored insurance on January 1, 2021.            For\nthese reasons, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for the administrative\njudge to take relevant evidence and argument and decide on an appropriate partial\nwaiver amount in the first instance. This might be a rather complex calculation\nwith many factors involved and may require a considerable amount of judgment\nand discretion. Therefore, the parties are strongly encouraged to cooperate in\ngood faith and, if possible, arrive at a mutually agreeable figure to present to the\nadministrative judge.\n\n                                     ORDER\n      For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the Western\nRegional Office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                        ______________________________\n                                      Jennifer Everling\n                                      Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/568067/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/779648/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1040711/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925357/", "id": 9925357, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467519/joshua-wible-v-department-of-veterans-affairs/", "cluster_id": 9467519, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467519/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:00:31.419216-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:05:57.032039-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "d356dcc6ba0987537de520973d1801c38f1cf225", "page_count": 8, "download_url": "https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential//Thornbury_Joshua_D_DE-0752-14-0490-X-1__Final Order.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/18/joshua_wible_v._department_of_veterans_affairs.pdf", "plain_text": "                       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n                    MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD\n\n\n    JOSHUA D.

CID at 5-6; see 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1201.183(a)(6)(i). He also informed the parties of their option to request Board\nreview of the compliance initial decision by filing a petition for review by\nMarch 20, 2018, the date on which the findings of noncompliance would become\nfinal unless a petition for review was filed.

For the reasons discussed below, we GRANT the appellant\u2019s petition for\nreview, AFFIRM the initial decision\u2019s finding that, although the appellant\nadministratively   exhausted    seven    personnel   actions   and   eight   protected\n1\n   A nonprecedential order is one that the Board has determined does not add\nsignificantly to the body of MSPB case law. Parties may cite nonprecedential orders,\nbut such orders have no precedential value; the Board and administrative judges are not\nrequired to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a\nprecedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\nas significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117(c).\n\f                                                                                     2\n\ndisclosures, certain other personnel actions were not exhausted, AFFIRM the\ninitial decision\u2019s determination that the appellant established by preponderant\nevidence that he made protected disclosures that were contributing factors in the\nchallenged personnel actions, REVERSE the initial decision\u2019s finding that the\nappellant did not administratively exhaust three disclosures made to the Office of\nInspector General (OIG) in May and June 2012, FIND that the appellant\nnonfrivolously   alleged   that   these   three   disclosures   were   protected   and\ncontributing factors in at least some of the personnel actions at issue in this case,\nVACATE the remainder of the initial decision, and REMAND the case to the\nregional office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n      In September 2011, the appellant was assigned to the position of Deputy\nDirector, 48th Force Support Squadron, 48th Mission Support Group, 48th Fighter\nWing, RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom.             Initial Appeal File (IAF), Tab 113\nat 4. In late 2012, the agency ended his assignment to the United Kingdom and\nreturned him to a position in the United States. Id. at 7.\n      The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\non March 21, 2013. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II. In his OSC complaint, he alleged\nthat, in reprisal for protected disclosures he made beginning in February 2012, the\nagency (1) threatened to curtail his overseas tour, (2) denied him a performance\naward, (3) placed him on administrative leave, (4) temporarily reassigned him,\n(5) suspended him for 7 days, (6) threatened again to curtail his overseas tour,\n(7) initiated several investigations targeting him, and (8) reassigned him from his\nassignment in the United Kingdom to a position in the United States. Id. at 11.\nIn addition to those acts of alleged whistleblower reprisal, the appellant also\nalleged in his OSC complaint that the agency had engaged in several other\nprohibited personnel practices. Id. at 6.\n\f                                                                                    3\n\n      On June 20, 2013, OSC issued a letter closing out its investigation and\nnotifying the appellant of his right to file an IRA appeal. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I\nat 20. He timely filed this appeal on August 16, 2013. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I. He\ninitially requested a hearing, id. at 3, but he later withdrew that request, IAF,\nTab 121.\n      In her initial decision, the administrative judge 2 found that the appellant\nhad exhausted his administrative remedies as to the eight allegedly retaliatory\npersonnel actions enumerated in his OSC complaint and initial appeal.            IAF,\nTab 135, Initial Decision (ID) at 9. She found, however, that the appellant had\nnot exhausted as to the additional alleged prohibited personnel practices he\nidentified in his OSC complaint because he did not specifically identify those\nactions to OSC as alleged whistleblower reprisal. Id. The administrative judge\nfurther found that the appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies as\nto any additional disclosures he made in complaints to the agency\u2019s OIG because\nhe did not specifically identify those disclosures as whistleblowing disclosures\nprotected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). ID at 10-11.\n      After finding that the appellant had established jurisdiction over his IRA\nappeal, ID at 13-15, the administrative judge found that the appellant proved by\npreponderant evidence that he made protected disclosures that were a contributing\nfactor in the personnel actions at issue, ID at 15-18, thus establishing his prima\nfacie case of whistleblower reprisal.       The administrative judge also found,\nhowever, that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would\nhave taken each of the personnel actions in the absence of the appellant\u2019s\ndisclosures.   ID at 19-40.     She therefore denied the appellant\u2019s request for\ncorrective action. ID at 41.\n      The appellant has timely filed a petition for review of the initial decision.\nPetition for Review (PFR) File, Tab 1. He argues that the administrative judge\n2\n  The appeal was reassigned to a different administrative judge in February 2016, IAF,\nTab 51, approximately 6 months before the initial decision was issued, IAF, Tab 135,\nInitial Decision.\n\f                                                                                      4\n\nerred in finding that he failed to exhaust his claims regarding the additional\ndisclosures to OIG. Id. at 6-7. He also argues that the administrative judge erred\nin failing to consider either the alleged retaliatory investigations or the denial of\nhis grievance as separate personnel actions. Id. at 7-8. In addition, the appellant\nchallenges the administrative judge\u2019s findings that the agency proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that it would have taken each of the personnel actions at\nissue in the absence of his protected disclosures. Id. at 9-23. The appellant also\nargues that the administrative judge made errors in her procedural and\ndiscovery-related rulings.    Id. at 24-27.    The agency has filed a response in\nopposition to the petition for review, PFR File, Tab 3, and the appellant has filed\na reply, PFR File, Tab 4.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\nThe appellant did not make an informed decision to withdraw his request for a\nhearing.\n      The appellant withdrew his hearing request and requested a decision on the\nwritten record on June 27, 2016, two days before the scheduled hearing. IAF,\nTabs 112, 121. In withdrawing his hearing request, the appellant cited a number\nof factors.   First, he cited the administrative judge\u2019s failure to suspend case\nprocessing in light of the agency\u2019s production of documents in discovery shortly\nbefore the scheduled hearing date. 3      IAF, Tab 121 at 4.        He also cited the\nadministrative judge\u2019s denial of his request to conduct self-recorded oral\ndepositions. Id. However, he indicated that in light of the parties\u2019 stipulations,\nalong with the evidence already in the record and the opportunity to submit a\nsworn statement, he believed there were sufficient undisputed material facts\nbefore the Board to make a finding of retaliation without a hearing. Id. In an\norder issued the following day, the administrative judge indicated that the\n3\n  On May 27 and June 8, 2016, the appellant requested that the administrative judge\nsuspend case processing in light of the difficulty he was having obtaining and reviewing\ndiscovery documents from the agency. IAF, Tabs 93, 108. The administrative judge\ndenied both requests. IAF, Tabs 96, 112.\n\f                                                                                        5\n\nappellant\u2019s pleading withdrawing his hearing request had misstated the status of\nthe parties\u2019 stipulations. IAF, Tab 122 at 1. She therefore gave the appellant\nuntil later the same day to rescind his withdrawal and proceed with a hearing. Id.\nThe appellant filed a pleading later that day in response to the administrative\njudge\u2019s order, but he did not indicate that he wanted to go forward with the\nhearing. IAF, Tab 123.\n      An appellant before the Board has the right to withdraw his request for a\nhearing; however, there is a strong policy in favor of granting an appellant a\nhearing on the merits of his case, and therefore, withdrawal of a hearing request\nmust come by way of clear, unequivocal, or decisive action.                 Pariseau v.\nDepartment of the Air Force, 113 M.S.P.R. 370, \u00b6 9 (2010); Conant v. Office of\nPersonnel Management, 79 M.S.P.R. 148, 150 (1998). Further, the decision to\nwithdraw a hearing request must be informed, i.e., the appellant must be fully\napprised of the relevant adjudicatory requirements and options.                Pariseau,\n113 M.S.P.R. 370, \u00b6 9.\n      Although the appellant\u2019s withdrawal of his hearing request was clear and\nequivocal, we find that it was not informed. An appellant\u2019s waiver of the right to\na hearing is informed when he has been fully apprised of the relevant\nadjudicatory requirements and options in his case, including the right to request a\npostponement or continuance of the hearing and a dismissal of the appeal without\nprejudice to its timely refiling. Conant, 79 M.S.P.R. at 151. Here, the record\nreflects that the appellant was aware of his right to request a suspension of case\nprocessing.    IAF, Tabs 93, 108.       However, there is nothing in the record to\nindicate that the administrative judge apprised the appellant that he could request\na dismissal without prejudice as an alternative to withdrawing his hearing\nrequest. 4 Therefore, given the strong policy in favor of granting an appellant a\n\n\n4\n The lack of such notice is particularly significant here, wherein the appellant cited the\nadministrative judge\u2019s refusal to suspend case processing as a significant factor in his\ndecision to withdraw his hearing request.\n\f                                                                                    6\n\nhearing on the merits of his appeal, the appellant may be entitled to the hearing\nhe initially requested and which he evidently still desires.\n\nThe appellant established Board jurisdiction over his alleged disclosures to OIG.\n      Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(3), an employee is required to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies with OSC before seeking corrective action from the\nBoard in an IRA appeal.          Mason v. Department of Homeland Security,\n116 M.S.P.R. 135, \u00b6 8 (2011). The Board may consider only those disclosures of\ninformation and personnel actions that the appellant raised before OSC. Id. To\nsatisfy the exhaustion requirement of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(3), an appellant must\nhave provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation into his\nallegations of whistleblower reprisal. Skarada v. Department of Veterans Affairs,\n2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Chambers v. Department of Homeland Security, 2022 MSPB\n8, \u00b6 10. Generally, an appellant may demonstrate exhaustion through his initial\nOSC complaint, evidence that he amended the original complaint (including but\nnot limited to OSC\u2019s determination letter and other letters from OSC referencing\nany amended allegations), and his written responses to OSC.               Skarada,\n2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Mason, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, \u00b6 8. Alternatively, an appellant\nmay prove exhaustion though other sufficiently reliable evidence, such as an\naffidavit or declaration attesting that he raised with OSC the substance of the\nfacts in his appeal. Skarada, 2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 7; Chambers, 2022 MSPB 8, \u00b6 11.\n      Here, the administrative judge found that, although the appellant had\nexhausted his administrative remedies as to eight alleged protected disclosures, he\nfailed to exhaust as to three additional disclosures made to OIG in May and\nJune 2012 because he did not specifically identify those disclosures to OSC as\nwhistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).        ID at 10-11.    The\nadministrative judge acknowledged that information regarding the three\nadditional disclosures were among the materials the appellant submitted to OSC,\nbut she found that their inclusion \u201camong the hundreds of pages of other\ndocuments he submitted to OSC\u201d was insufficient to satisfy the exhaustion\n\f                                                                                       7\n\nrequirement. ID at 11. She noted that the appellant had not included those OIG\ncomplaints among the list of eight protected disclosures he specifically identified\nin his complaint to OSC. Id. 5\n      Although the appellant did not specifically identify the three additional\ndisclosures to OIG as alleged whistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8), the labels he used are not determinative. See McCarthy v. Merit\nSystems Protection Board, 809 F.3d 1365, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (noting that \u201cthe\nfocus of the exhaustion requirement is on substance,\u201d rather than whether the\nappellant correctly affixed legal labels to the facts alleged).          The appellant\nprovided information to OSC about the content of his complaints to OIG. IAF,\nTab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab A at 7-8; IAF, Tab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab C,\nSubtabs 44, 46. He also alleged before OSC that his OIG complaints constituted\nprotected disclosures that were the bases for at least some allegedly retaliatory\npersonnel actions. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II, OSC Tab B at 6-7. This was sufficient\nfor OSC to pursue an investigation into whether the agency violated 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8) or (b)(9) by retaliating against the appellant for filing his OIG\ncomplaints. 6   We therefore find that the appellant satisfied the exhaustion\nrequirement as to the three additional disclosures to OIG. We must therefore\ndetermine whether the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his disclosures to\nOIG constituted protected disclosures that were a contributing factor in one or\nmore of the challenged personnel actions. See Yunus v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the Board has jurisdiction over an\n\n5\n  We agree with the administrative judge that because the events at issue in this case\ntook place before the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act\nof 2012, the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in this IRA appeal is limited to claims of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Therefore, the appellant\u2019s claim that the\nagency retaliated against him for filing OIG complaints in violation of 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(9) is not itself a basis for Board jurisdiction. Colbert v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, \u00b6 7 (2014).\n6\n  OSC is required to investigate all allegations of prohibited personnel practices,\nregardless of whether those allegations can form the basis of an IRA appeal before the\nBoard. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A).\n\f                                                                                      8\n\nIRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies\nbefore OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that (1) he engaged in\nwhistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure and (2) the disclosure\nwas a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a\npersonnel action).\n      A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the\nmatter at issue. Bradley v. Department of Homeland Security, 123 M.S.P.R. 547,\n\u00b6 6 (2016); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.4(s). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit has found that, in the context of an IRA appeal, a nonfrivolous allegation\nis an allegation of \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board, 979 F.3d\n1362, 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2020).        Whether allegations are nonfrivolous is\ndetermined on the basis of the written record. Bradley, 123 M.S.P.R. 547, \u00b6 6.\nAny doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant made nonfrivolous\njurisdictional allegations should be resolved in favor of finding jurisdiction. Id.\n      A nonfrivolous allegation of a protected whistleblowing disclosure is an\nallegation of fact that, if proven, would show that the appellant disclosed a matter\nthat a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced one of the\ncategories of wrongdoing specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).               Salerno v.\nDepartment of the Interior, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, \u00b6 6 (2016). The test to determine\nwhether a putative whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the disclosure is an\nobjective one: whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential\nfacts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably\nconclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of any law, rule, or\nregulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority,\nor a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Id.; see 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2302(b)(8).   For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that each of his disclosures to OIG was protected.\n\f                                                                                      9\n\n      On May 21, 2012, the appellant filed a complaint with OIG alleging that\nthe agency violated its own procedures in suspending his clearance. IAF, Tab 1,\nVolume II at 616-19. On May 16, 2012, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat his security clearance was being suspended temporarily and he was being\nplaced on administrative leave pending an investigation into alleged misconduct.\nId. at 603. In his OIG complaint, the appellant alleged that the suspension of his\nclearance violated the procedures set forth in the agency\u2019s internal rules.         Id.\nat 617.   According to the appellant, he was later informed that despite his\ncommander\u2019s notice, his security clearance was not formally suspended.              Id.\nat 74-76. Nevertheless, the appellant reasonably believed at the time he filed his\nOIG complaint that the agency had suspended his security clearance contrary to\nits own policies. We find the appellant has thus nonfrivolously alleged that he\ndisclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation, and that the disclosure in his first\nOIG complaint is therefore protected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).\n      The appellant filed a second OIG complaint 2 days after the first alleging\nthat one of his supervisors was retaliating against him for meeting with OIG\n2 days earlier.   IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 621-24.        Specifically, the appellant\nalleged that shortly after he informed a management official that he had an\nappointment with OIG on May 21, the agency started a new security investigation\ninto him. The appellant alleged that the facts giving rise to the investigation were\nknown to the agency for 2 days, but the agency only initiated the investigation\nafter it learned of the appellant\u2019s contact with OIG.       Id. at 622. The facts as\nalleged by the appellant appear to support a reasonable belief that the agency was\nretaliating against him for his meeting with OIG. Such an action would be a\nviolation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(C), which makes it a prohibited personnel\npractice to retaliate against an employee for \u201ccooperating with or disclosing\ninformation to the Inspector General of an agency . . . in accordance with\napplicable provisions of law.\u201d Under the law in effect at the time of the events at\nissue in this case, it was a protected whistleblowing disclosure to disclose to the\n\f                                                                                  10\n\nInspector General of an agency \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(B)(i) (2012). 7   We therefore find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that his second OIG complaint constituted a protected\ndisclosure.\n      The appellant filed a third OIG complaint in early July 2012 seeking to\ncompel the agency to produce documents he had requested under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA).      IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 24, 459.          The agency\nacknowledged that it received the appellant\u2019s FOIA request on May 2, 2012, and\nhad not responded by May 31, 2012, as promised. IAF, Tab 113 at 8, 18. In\nresponse to inquiries from OIG about the status of the appellant\u2019s request, the\nagency indicated on July 5, 2012, that the request was still under review.        Id.\nat 21. We therefore find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that, at the time\nhe filed his third OIG complaint, he reasonably believed that the agency was\nviolating FOIA by failing to timely respond to his request.\n      To satisfy the contributing factor criterion at the jurisdictional stage, an\nappellant only need raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of,\nthe protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action\nin any way. Ontivero v. Department of Homeland Security, 117 M.S.P.R. 600,\n\u00b6 21 (2012). One way to establish this criterion is the knowledge/timing test,\nunder which an employee may nonfrivolously allege that the disclosure was a\ncontributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as\nevidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and\nthat the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable\nperson could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the\npersonnel action. Id. The Board has held that a personnel action taken within\n7\n  Section 101(a)(2) of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA),\nPub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465, amended 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(B)(i) to strike \u201ca\nviolation\u201d and insert \u201cany violation (other than a violation of this section).\u201d Thus,\nalthough disclosing a violation of section 2302 itself would not be a protected\ndisclosure under the WPEA, it was a protected disclosure under the pre-WPEA law we\nare applying here.\n\f                                                                                     11\n\napproximately 1 to 2 years of the appellant\u2019s disclosures satisfies the\nknowledge/timing test.     Id., \u00b6 23.   We find that the appellant nonfrivolously\nalleged that his OIG disclosures were a contributing factor in at least some of the\nchallenged personnel actions.\n      In a June 12, 2012 memorandum, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat he would be loaned to work in another organization pending final action on\ninvestigations against him. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 633. In his memo, the\ncommander acknowledged \u201cmatters and complaints [the appellant] raised through\nInspector General channels at various levels of command.\u201d Id. This evidence is\nsufficient to establish that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the\ncommander was aware of his May 21 and 23 complaints to OIG. Accordingly, we\nfind that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his May 21 and 23 disclosures\nto OIG were a contributing factor in those personnel actions taking place on or\nafter June 12, 2012, which include the loan itself as well as the 7-day suspension\nand the curtailment of the appellant\u2019s overseas assignment. As to the appellant\u2019s\nFOIA disclosure, the agency submitted email traffic that shows that it was aware\nof the appellant\u2019s complaint shortly after it was filed. IAF, Tab 113 at 17-25.\nThus, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his FOIA disclosure\nwas a contributing factor in at least some of the challenged personnel actions,\nincluding the 7-day suspension and the curtailment of his overseas assignment.\nAccordingly, the appellant is entitled to have those claims of whistleblower\nreprisal adjudicated on the merits on remand. 8\n\n\n8\n  The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies as to several additional personnel actions, which she found were presented to\nOSC not as whistleblower reprisal, but as other prohibited personnel practices. ID at 9.\nOn review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should not have even\nincluded those personnel actions in her prehearing conference summary because he did\nnot ask for them to be adjudicated in this appeal. PFR File, Tab 1 at 24. Because the\nappellant has indicated that he does not wish to pursue those additional personnel\nactions in this IRA appeal, we need not review the administrative judge\u2019s determination\nthat those personnel actions were not exhausted before OSC.\n\f                                                                                    12\n\nThe administrative judge should consider the appellant\u2019s retaliatory investigation\nclaims further on remand.\n         The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to\nconsider alleged retaliatory investigations as personnel actions. PFR File, Tab 1\nat 7-8.    He cites the Board\u2019s holding in Russell v. Department of Justice,\n76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (1997), in support of this argument.           However, the\nBoard in Russell did not hold that investigations should be considered as separate\npersonnel actions. Rather, the Board held that it will consider evidence regarding\nthe conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely\nrelated to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering\nevidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity. Id. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s consideration of the agency\u2019s investigations in this case\nwas consistent with that holding.       ID at 13 (citing Wadhwa v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 111 M.S.P.R. 26, \u00b6 9, aff\u2019d, 353 F. App\u2019x 434 (Fed. Cir. 2009),\noverruled on other grounds by Hau v. Department of Homeland Security,\n123 M.S.P.R. 620, \u00b6 16 (2016), aff\u2019d sub nom. Bryant v. Merit Systems Protection\nBoard, 878 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).\n         Nevertheless, we find that the administrative judge should consider on\nremand whether the appellant\u2019s claims regarding agency investigations are\nactionable in light of Board decisions issued since the initial decision in this case.\nSpecifically, the Board clarified that, although an investigation is not a personnel\naction per se, an investigation can qualify as a personnel action in an IRA appeal\nif it amounts to a significant change in job duties, responsibilities, or working\nconditions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). Spivey v. Department of Justice,\n2022 MSPB 24, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. The Board also clarified that only agency actions that,\nindividually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall\nnature     and   quality   of   an   employee\u2019s   working   conditions,   duties,   or\nresponsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by\nsection 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).     Skarada, 2022 MSPB 17, \u00b6 16.        On remand, the\n\f                                                                                  13\n\nadministrative judge should consider whether the appellant can establish an\nadditional personnel action under the standard set forth in Spivey and Skarada.\n\nThe appellant\u2019s remaining arguments have not established adjudicatory error.\n        The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred by failing to\naddress a grievance he filed. PFR File, Tab 1 at 8. To the extent the appellant is\narguing that the administrative judge should have adjudicated the grievance as a\nseparate personnel action, we find that the grievance was not among the personnel\nactions identified by the appellant in his initial appeal. IAF, Tab 1, Volume I\nat 5.    Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge\u2019s failure to\nadjudicate the grievance as an independent personnel action.\n        The appellant raises a number of arguments on petition for review relating\nto discovery. PFR File, Tab 1 at 24-27. In addition to challenging several of the\nadministrative judges\u2019 actions, the appellant argues more broadly that both\nadministrative judges assigned to the appeal demonstrated bias against him in\ntheir procedural and discovery rulings. Id.\n        In making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a\nparty must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies\nadministrative adjudicators. Oliver v. Department of Transportation, 1 M.S.P.R.\n382, 386 (1980). An administrative judge\u2019s conduct during the course of a Board\nproceeding warrants a new adjudication only if her comments or actions evidence\n\u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment\nimpossible.\u201d Bieber v. Department of the Army, 287 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed.\nCir. 2002) (quoting Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994)); Scoggins\nv. Department of the Army, 123 M.S.P.R. 592, \u00b6 19 (2016). None of the rulings\nor actions cited by the appellant are sufficient to overcome the presumption of\nhonesty and integrity, nor do they evidence a deep-seated favoritism or\nantagonism on the part of either administrative judge. We therefore find that the\nappellant has failed to establish administrative judge bias.\n\f                                                                                 14\n\n      Putting aside the issue of bias, we next turn to the specific discovery\nmatters raised by the appellant on petition for review. An administrative judge\nhas broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters, and absent an abuse of\ndiscretion, the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings. E.g., Kingsley\nv. U.S. Postal Service, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, \u00b6 16 (2016). For the reasons set forth\nbelow, we find that the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge\ncommitted any reversible error regarding discovery.\n      First, the appellant challenges the administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions he sought to take. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25. Specifically, the appellant\nsought an order from the administrative judge not only requiring that depositions\ntake place, but also authorizing the appellant to record those depositions himself\nrather than hiring a court reporter to record or transcribe them. IAF, Tab 56 at 5.\nThe administrative judge informed the appellant that he could conduct\ndepositions \u201ceither in the presence of a certified court reporter or upon written\nquestions.\u201d   IAF, Tab 61 at 2.     The appellant moved for certification of an\ninterlocutory appeal regarding his request to self-record depositions, IAF, Tab 65,\nbut the administrative judge denied that motion, IAF, Tab 66. In denying the\nappellant\u2019s motion, the administrative judge explained that the appellant was free\nto interview witnesses without a court reporter present, but that any audio\nrecording or \u201cunqualified transcription\u201d of such interviews would not be\nadmissible.   IAF, Tab 66 at 2.     The administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions are consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 28(a) (limiting the individuals before whom a deposition may be taken),\nwhich may be used as a general guide for discovery practices in Board\nproceedings, see Special Counsel v. Zimmerman, 36 M.S.P.R. 274, 286 (1988).\nWe therefore find no abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s rulings\nregarding depositions. We also agree with her determination that the criteria for\ncertifying an interlocutory appeal were not met. See Robinson v. Department of\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nthe Army, 50 M.S.P.R. 412, 418 (1991); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.92 (setting forth the\ncriteria for certification of an interlocutory appeal).\n       The appellant also argues that the administrative judge improperly delayed\nher ruling on the agency\u2019s assertion of the deliberative process privilege and that\nshe otherwise erred in failing to compel discovery or sanction the agency for its\ninadequate discovery responses. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25-26. However, we find\nthat he has not shown any abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s\nhandling of discovery matters. Because we are remanding this appeal for further\nadjudication, we need not address the appellant\u2019s arguments challenging the\nadministrative judge\u2019s findings on the merits of his whistleblower reprisal claims.\n\n                                       ORDER\n       For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the regional office\nfor further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.                 The\nadministrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing on remand if he requests\none.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                          ______________________________\n                                        Jennifer Everling\n                                        Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n                   MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD\n\n\nTIMOTHY G.

IAF,\nTab 135, Initial Decision (ID) at 9.

For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that each of his disclosures to OIG was protected.\n\f                                                                                      9\n\n      On May 21, 2012, the appellant filed a complaint with OIG alleging that\nthe agency violated its own procedures in suspending his clearance. IAF, Tab 1,\nVolume II at 616-19. On May 16, 2012, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat his security clearance was being suspended temporarily and he was being\nplaced on administrative leave pending an investigation into alleged misconduct.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 603</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In his OIG complaint, the appellant alleged that the suspension of his\nclearance violated the procedures set forth in the agency\u2019s internal rules.         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\nat 617</span><pre class=\"inline\">.   According to the appellant, he was later informed that despite his\ncommander\u2019s notice, his security clearance was not formally suspended.              </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\nat 74-76</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Nevertheless, the appellant reasonably believed at the time he filed his\nOIG complaint that the agency had suspended his security clearance contrary to\nits own policies. We find the appellant has thus nonfrivolously alleged that he\ndisclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation, and that the disclosure in his first\nOIG complaint is therefore protected under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b)(8).\n      The appellant filed a second OIG complaint 2 days after the first alleging\nthat one of his supervisors was retaliating against him for meeting with OIG\n2 days earlier.   IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 621-24.        Specifically, the appellant\nalleged that shortly after he informed a management official that he had an\nappointment with OIG on May 21, the agency started a new security investigation\ninto him. The appellant alleged that the facts giving rise to the investigation were\nknown to the agency for 2 days, but the agency only initiated the investigation\nafter it learned of the appellant\u2019s contact with OIG.       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 622</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The facts as\nalleged by the appellant appear to support a reasonable belief that the agency was\nretaliating against him for his meeting with OIG. Such an action would be a\nviolation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b)(9)(C), which makes it a prohibited personnel\npractice to retaliate against an employee for \u201ccooperating with or disclosing\ninformation to the Inspector General of an agency . . . in accordance with\napplicable provisions of law.\u201d Under the law in effect at the time of the events at\nissue in this case, it was a protected whistleblowing disclosure to disclose to the\n\f                                                                                  10\n\nInspector General of an agency \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b)(8)(B)(i) (2012). 7   We therefore find that the appellant has\nnonfrivolously alleged that his second OIG complaint constituted a protected\ndisclosure.\n      The appellant filed a third OIG complaint in early July 2012 seeking to\ncompel the agency to produce documents he had requested under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA).      IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 24, 459.          The agency\nacknowledged that it received the appellant\u2019s FOIA request on May 2, 2012, and\nhad not responded by May 31, 2012, as promised. IAF, Tab 113 at 8, 18. In\nresponse to inquiries from OIG about the status of the appellant\u2019s request, the\nagency indicated on July 5, 2012, that the request was still under review.        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\nat 21</span><pre class=\"inline\">. We therefore find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that, at the time\nhe filed his third OIG complaint, he reasonably believed that the agency was\nviolating FOIA by failing to timely respond to his request.\n      To satisfy the contributing factor criterion at the jurisdictional stage, an\nappellant only need raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of,\nthe protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action\nin any way. Ontivero v. Department of Homeland Security, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">117 M.S.P.R. 600</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\u00b6 21 (2012). One way to establish this criterion is the knowledge/timing test,\nunder which an employee may nonfrivolously allege that the disclosure was a\ncontributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as\nevidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and\nthat the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable\nperson could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the\npersonnel action. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> The Board has held that a personnel action taken within\n7\n  Section 101(a)(2) of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA),\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Pub.

We find that the appellant nonfrivolously\nalleged that his OIG disclosures were a contributing factor in at least some of the\nchallenged personnel actions.\n      In a June 12, 2012 memorandum, the appellant\u2019s commander informed him\nthat he would be loaned to work in another organization pending final action on\ninvestigations against him. IAF, Tab 1, Volume II at 633. In his memo, the\ncommander acknowledged \u201cmatters and complaints [the appellant] raised through\nInspector General channels at various levels of command.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> This evidence is\nsufficient to establish that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the\ncommander was aware of his May 21 and 23 complaints to OIG. Accordingly, we\nfind that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his May 21 and 23 disclosures\nto OIG were a contributing factor in those personnel actions taking place on or\nafter June 12, 2012, which include the loan itself as well as the 7-day suspension\nand the curtailment of the appellant\u2019s overseas assignment. As to the appellant\u2019s\nFOIA disclosure, the agency submitted email traffic that shows that it was aware\nof the appellant\u2019s complaint shortly after it was filed. IAF, Tab 113 at 17-25.\nThus, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his FOIA disclosure\nwas a contributing factor in at least some of the challenged personnel actions,\nincluding the 7-day suspension and the curtailment of his overseas assignment.\nAccordingly, the appellant is entitled to have those claims of whistleblower\nreprisal adjudicated on the merits on remand. 8\n\n\n8\n  The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies as to several additional personnel actions, which she found were presented to\nOSC not as whistleblower reprisal, but as other prohibited personnel practices. ID at 9.\nOn review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should not have even\nincluded those personnel actions in her prehearing conference summary because he did\nnot ask for them to be adjudicated in this appeal. PFR File, Tab 1 at 24. Because the\nappellant has indicated that he does not wish to pursue those additional personnel\nactions in this IRA appeal, we need not review the administrative judge\u2019s determination\nthat those personnel actions were not exhausted before OSC.\n\f                                                                                    12\n\nThe administrative judge should consider the appellant\u2019s retaliatory investigation\nclaims further on remand.\n         The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to\nconsider alleged retaliatory investigations as personnel actions. PFR File, Tab 1\nat 7-8.    He cites the Board\u2019s holding in Russell v.

However, the\nBoard in Russell did not hold that investigations should be considered as separate\npersonnel actions.

Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge\u2019s failure to\nadjudicate the grievance as an independent personnel action.\n        The appellant raises a number of arguments on petition for review relating\nto discovery.

None of the rulings\nor actions cited by the appellant are sufficient to overcome the presumption of\nhonesty and integrity, nor do they evidence a deep-seated favoritism or\nantagonism on the part of either administrative judge. We therefore find that the\nappellant has failed to establish administrative judge bias.\n\f                                                                                 14\n\n      Putting aside the issue of bias, we next turn to the specific discovery\nmatters raised by the appellant on petition for review. An administrative judge\nhas broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters, and absent an abuse of\ndiscretion, the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings. E.g., Kingsley\nv. U.S. Postal Service, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">123 M.S.P.R. 365</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 16 (2016). For the reasons set forth\nbelow, we find that the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge\ncommitted any reversible error regarding discovery.\n      First, the appellant challenges the administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions he sought to take. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25. Specifically, the appellant\nsought an order from the administrative judge not only requiring that depositions\ntake place, but also authorizing the appellant to record those depositions himself\nrather than hiring a court reporter to record or transcribe them. IAF, Tab 56 at 5.\nThe administrative judge informed the appellant that he could conduct\ndepositions \u201ceither in the presence of a certified court reporter or upon written\nquestions.\u201d   IAF, Tab 61 at 2.     The appellant moved for certification of an\ninterlocutory appeal regarding his request to self-record depositions, IAF, Tab 65,\nbut the administrative judge denied that motion, IAF, Tab 66. In denying the\nappellant\u2019s motion, the administrative judge explained that the appellant was free\nto interview witnesses without a court reporter present, but that any audio\nrecording or \u201cunqualified transcription\u201d of such interviews would not be\nadmissible.   IAF, Tab 66 at 2.     The administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding\ndepositions are consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 28(a) (limiting the individuals before whom a deposition may be taken),\nwhich may be used as a general guide for discovery practices in Board\nproceedings, see Special Counsel v. Zimmerman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">36 M.S.P.R. 274</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286 (1988).\nWe therefore find no abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s rulings\nregarding depositions. We also agree with her determination that the criteria for\ncertifying an interlocutory appeal were not met. See Robinson v. Department of\n\f                                                                                 15\n\nthe Army, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">50 M.S.P.R. 412</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (1991); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.92</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (setting forth the\ncriteria for certification of an interlocutory appeal).\n       The appellant also argues that the administrative judge improperly delayed\nher ruling on the agency\u2019s assertion of the deliberative process privilege and that\nshe otherwise erred in failing to compel discovery or sanction the agency for its\ninadequate discovery responses. PFR File, Tab 1 at 25-26. However, we find\nthat he has not shown any abuse of discretion in the administrative judge\u2019s\nhandling of discovery matters. Because we are remanding this appeal for further\nadjudication, we need not address the appellant\u2019s arguments challenging the\nadministrative judge\u2019s findings on the merits of his whistleblower reprisal claims.\n\n                                       ORDER\n       For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the regional office\nfor further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order.                 The\nadministrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing on remand if he requests\none.\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE BOARD:                          ______________________________\n                                        Jennifer Everling\n                                        Acting Clerk of the Board\nWashington, D.C.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112935/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/772428/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777423/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3169664/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4233384/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8474814/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9372775/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9372782/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9372791/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925355/", "id": 9925355, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467517/wilkinson-v-dayton/", "cluster_id": 9467517, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467517/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T07:09:20.723793-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T07:30:30.915904-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "a7724f0c65dba3d378a8eed238ddc2a46f72704e", "page_count": 16, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2024/2024-Ohio-180.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/wilkinson_v._dayton.pdf", "plain_text": "[Cite as Wilkinson v.

For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                                                                        -2-\n\n\n\n\n                          I.     Facts and Procedural Background\n\n       {\u00b6 2} This case arises from the shooting deaths of Aisha Nelson and her minor\n\ndaughter Harper Guynn. Because this case was resolved upon a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss, the facts are gleaned from the allegations as set forth in the complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At the time of the shooting, Nelson and Guynn resided at 337 Burleigh\n\nAvenue in Dayton. Waverly \u201cDante\u201d Hawes, with whom Nelson was in a relationship,\n\nalso resided at that address.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} During the evening hours of June 22, 2022, Nelson contacted the Dayton\n\nPolice Department and reported that Hawes had \u201cthreatened her life.\u201d She asked the\n\ndispatcher to have officers meet her at a nearby store \u201cso as not to arouse Hawes\u2019\n\nsuspicions.\u201d   \u201cAfter waiting for some time,\u201d Nelson again called the Dayton Police\n\nDepartment and stated that \u201cshe had seen several police cars, [but] none of them had\n\nstopped. She had her daughter in the vehicle[,] and it was late at night so she advised\n\nthat she was going to go home and would make a report the next day.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 5} During the early morning hours of June 23, 2022, \u201cHawes called police to the\n\nhome on Burleigh and stated he wanted [Nelson] to leave.\u201d Dayton Police Department\n\nOfficers Kathryn Santos and Terrell Moore responded to the residence and spoke with\n\nboth Hawes and Nelson. During her interview, Nelson \u201cinformed Santos that Hawes had\n\nmade multiple threats to her life and that there was a weapon in the house that Hawes\n\nhad easy access to.\u201d She further stated that Hawes had repeatedly \u201cbrandish[ed] a gun\u201d\n\nand \u201cthreatened violence against [her]\u201d in the presence of Guynn and Hawes\u2019s own\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\ndaughter. Nelson stated \u201cthat Hawes was like a \u2018[l]ion in a concrete jungle in here, but\n\nit\u2019s like he locked himself in that basement. He\u2019s down in that basement with his gun\n\nrocking in recliner [sic] back and forth.\u201d Nelson further stated that Hawes had \u201ccut up her\n\ncredit cards and emptied her accounts leaving her with no option of anywhere to go.\u201d\n\nNelson asked the officers to remove Hawes from the home.\n\n      {\u00b6 6} Moore and Santos left the residence at approximately 2:35 a.m. without\n\nmaking an arrest or \u201ctaking a formal report.\u201d At some point between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00\n\na.m., Hawes fatally shot both Nelson and Guynn. Hawes fled the scene, but he was later\n\nfound dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n      {\u00b6 7} Patricia Wilkinson was appointed administrator of the estates of Nelson and\n\nGuynn. Wilkinson filed this action on December 5, 2022. She filed a first amended\n\ncomplaint the following day.     The suit named the City of Dayton, the Dayton City\n\nCommission, the City of Dayton Commissioners, the Dayton Chief of Police, and Officers\n\nMoore and Santos as defendants. The suit also named \u201cJohn and/or Jane Doe(s) 1-10\n\nindividually and as agents of the City of Dayton\u201d as defendants.\n\n      {\u00b6 8} On March 6, 2023, Santos and Moore filed a joint motion to dismiss. The\n\nother defendants also filed motions to dismiss. On April 12, 2023, Wilkinson filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a second amended complaint along with the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint. On April 14, 2023, she filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to\n\ndismiss filed by Moore and Santos. On April 17, 2023, she voluntarily dismissed her\n\nclaims against all defendants except Moore and Santos.\n\n      {\u00b6 9} On May 5, 2023, the trial court granted Moore and Santos\u2019s motion and\n\f                                                                                         -4-\n\n\ndismissed all pending claims against them. The trial court also overruled Wilkinson\u2019s\n\nmotion for leave to file a seconded amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Wilkinson appeals.\n\n\n\n                           II.

Thus, the appellate court \u201cmust independently review the complaint to determine\n\nwhether dismissal is appropriate.\u201d Boyd at \u00b6 13, quoting Ament v. Reassure Am. Life Ins.\n\nCo., 180 Ohio App.3d 440, 2009-Ohio-36, 905 N.E.2d 1246, \u00b6 60 (8th Dist.).\n\n\n\n                                   B. Petition for Discovery\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Wilkinson\u2019s first cause of action, which seeks the production of certain\n\ndocuments, is labeled as a \u201cPetition for Discovery Against Defendants City, Commission,\n\nand Afzal [the police chief].\u201d Wilkinson does not state whether she relies on Civ.R. 34(D)\n\nor R.C. 2317.48 as authority for the petition. Thus, we must examine both in determining\n\nwhether the decision to dismiss was appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} R.C. 2317.48 states, in part:\n\f                                                                                       -6-\n\n\n      When a person claiming to have a cause of action or a defense to an action\n\n      commenced against him, without the discovery of a fact from the adverse\n\n      party, is unable to file his complaint or answer, he may bring an action for\n\n      discovery, setting forth in his complaint in the action for discovery the\n\n      necessity and the grounds for the action, with any interrogatories relating to\n\n      the subject matter of the discovery that are necessary to procure the\n\n      discovery sought. * * *\n\n      {\u00b6 17} The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that an \u201caction for discovery\n\npursuant to R.C. 2317.48 is limited solely to interrogatories specifically concerning the\n\nfacts necessary to the complaint or answer * * *.\u201d Riverview Health Inst., L.L.C. v. Kral,\n\n2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24931, 2012-Ohio-3502, \u00b6 18, quoting Poulos v. Parker\n\nSweeper Co., 44 Ohio St.3d 124, 127, 541 N.E.2d 1031 (1989). Such \u201cinterrogatories\n\nare to be limited and directed toward only those facts necessary to draft a complaint or\n\nanswer * * *.\u201d Id. R.C. 2317.48 does not apply to a request for production of documents.\n\nRiverview at \u00b6 18. Because Wilkinson solely sought production of documents in her first\n\namended and proposed second amended complaints, she was not entitled to relief under\n\nR.C. 2317.48.\n\n      {\u00b6 18} Civ.R. 34(D) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n      (1) Subject to the scope of discovery provisions of Civ.R. 26(B) and 45(F),\n\n      a person who claims to have a potential cause of action may file a petition\n\n      to obtain discovery as provided in this rule. Prior to filing a petition for\n\n      discovery, the person seeking discovery shall make reasonable efforts to\n\f                                                                                          -7-\n\n\n       obtain voluntarily the information from the person from whom the discovery\n\n       is sought. The petition shall be captioned in the name of the person seeking\n\n       discovery and be filed in the court of common pleas in the county in which\n\n       the person from whom the discovery is sought resides, the person's\n\n       principal place of business is located, or the potential action may be filed.\n\n       ***\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Civ.R. 34(D) did not provide Wilkinson with a cause of action for discovery,\n\nbecause it pertains to pre-suit discovery and limits the discovery to information that is\n\n\u201cnecessary to ascertain the identity of a potential adverse party[.]\u201d Cruz v.

Windsor House, Inc., 2023-Ohio-352, 208 N.E.3d 246, \u00b6 46 (11th Dist.).\nThough almost always litigated in the same action, a survivorship claim, which is created\nand governed by R.C. 2305.21, is a separate cause of action.

And, as set forth below, they had no legal duty to arrest Hawes.\n\nWithout the existence of a duty, \u201cno legal liability can arise on account of negligence.\u201d\n\n\n2\n Wilkinson alleges that Moore and Santo had a statutory duty to arrest Hawes.\nHowever, as discussed below in relation to the sixth cause of action, this argument fails.\n\f                                                                                          -10-\n\n\nJeffers v. Olexo, 43 Ohio St.3d 140, 142, 539 N.E.2d 614 (1989). Considering the facts\n\nand law, and finding no that special relationship was demonstrated, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court did not err in dismissing Wilkinson\u2019s claims for wrongful death and survivorship.\n\n\n\n                      D. Civil Liability for Criminal Offenses \u2013 R.C. 2307.60\n\n       {\u00b6 28} For her sixth cause of action, Wilkinson asserted an entitlement to damages\n\nas provided in R.C. 2307.60. That statute \u201cindependently authorize[s] a civil action for\n\ndamages caused by criminal acts, unless otherwise prohibited by law[.]\u201d Jacobson v.\n\nKaforey, 149 Ohio St.3d 398, 2016-Ohio-8434, 75 N.E.3d 203, \u00b6 6. 10. In pertinent part,\n\nthe statute states:\n\n       Anyone injured in person or property by a criminal act has, and may recover\n\n       full damages in, a civil action unless specifically excepted by law, may\n\n       recover the costs of maintaining the civil action and attorney's fees if\n\n       authorized by any provision of the Rules of Civil Procedure or another\n\n       section of the Revised Code or under the common law of this state, and\n\n       may recover punitive or exemplary damages if authorized by section\n\n       2315.21 or another section of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 29} In the first amended complaint, Wilkerson asserted that Moore and Santos\n\nwere guilty of the crime of dereliction of duty as proscribed by R.C. 2921.44. Specifically,\n\nthat complaint cited R.C. 2921.44(E), which states that \u201c[n]o public servant shall\n\nrecklessly fail to perform a duty expressly imposed by law with respect to the public\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nservant\u2019s office, or recklessly do any act expressly forbidden by law with respect to the\n\npublic servant\u2019s office.\u201d The first amended complaint then asserted that Santos and\n\nMoore \u201cwantonly, willfully, intentionally, maliciously, and not in good faith failed to perform\n\ntheir duties * * *,\u201d and that this failure was \u201ca crime under R.C. 2921.44(F).\u201d From this,\n\nthe first amended complaint asserted a right to recovery under R.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 30} In their motion to dismiss, Santos and Moore argued that, to avoid a Civ.R.\n\n12(B)(6) dismissal, Wilkerson had to \u201cidentify a duty expressly imposed by law on * * *\n\nSantos and Moore, the violation of which caused injury.\u201d Santos and Moore then argued\n\nthat, if the first amended complaint asserted that they had a duty to arrest Hawes for\n\ndomestic violence under R.C. 2935.032, this assertion was incorrect because R.C.\n\n2935.032 \u201conly impose[s] an arrest obligation if an officer determine[s] that an offender\n\n[has] committed felonious assault or aggravated assault\u201d; the first amended complaint did\n\nnot contain this allegation.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} The trial court determined that the sixth cause of action was subject to\n\ndismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), reasoning that R.C. 2921.44(E) requires the underlying\n\nstatute \u201cto expressly impose a duty upon the accused; an implied duty is therefore\n\ninsufficient to support a charge of dereliction of duty.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Then, the trial\n\ncourt concluded:\n\n       [Wilkinson] argue[s] [Santos and Moore] had a duty to arrest [Hawes] and/or\n\n       remove him from the premises but fail[s] to point to a duty expressly\n\n       imposed by law. Instead, [Wilkinson] * * * mis-cite[s] laws not imposing an\n\f                                                                                         -12-\n\n\n       express duty to arrest or remove and * * * guideline policies3 created by [the\n\n       Dayton Police Department] which, by their very nature, do not require arrest\n\n       and removal. Therefore, [Wilkinson\u2019s] sixth cause of action is dismissed.\n\n(Emphasis sic.) (Footnote added.)\n\n       {\u00b6 32} We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Based upon the facts set forth\n\nin the first amended complaint, neither the domestic violence statute nor the Dayton\n\nPolice Department domestic violence guidelines imposed an express duty upon Officers\n\nSantos and Moore to arrest Hawes, to remove him from the premises, or to take any other\n\naction. Instead, both the statue and the guidelines state that, under certain circumstances,\n\nan arrest is the \u201cpreferred course of action.\u201d This language clearly gives the officers\n\nsome degree of discretion in determining whether to make an arrest, and thus cannot be\n\nconsidered an express legal duty. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing the sixth cause of action.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Wilkinson also claims the trial court erred in dismissing this cause of action\n\nbecause another section of R.C. 2921.44 provided a basis for liability. Specifically, she\n\nargues that under R.C. 2921.44(A), a law enforcement officer commits the crime of\n\ndereliction of duty when he or she negligently \u201c[f]ail[s] to prevent or halt the commission\n\nof an offense or to apprehend an offender, when it is in the law enforcement officer's\n\npower to do so alone or with available assistance.\u201d         Wilkinson contends that this\n\nprovision made the officers\u2019 failure to take action against Hawes a crime.\n\n\n\n3\n Dayton Police Department General Order 2.01-2, which articulates the department\u2019s\ndomestic violence response guidelines, was attached to the first amended complaint as\nExhibit 2.\n\f                                                                                          -13-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 34} However, this argument was not raised by Wilkinson at any time in the trial\n\ncourt. Indeed, she raised it for the first time in her appellate reply brief. \u201c[A]rguments\n\nraised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by an appellate court.\u201d Budz v.\n\nSomerfield, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 29550, 2023-Ohio-155, \u00b6 30, citing Powell v.\n\nCleveland, 2022-Ohio-4286, 202 N.E.3d 794, \u00b6 53 (8th Dist.). The rationale for this\n\nconclusion is that a party should not be \u201cgiven a second chance to raise arguments that\n\nthey should have raised below.\u201d Id., citing Hamper v. Suburban Umpires Assn., Inc., 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 92505, 2009-Ohio-5376, \u00b6 27, quoting Perlmutter v. People's Jewelry\n\nCo., 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-04-1271, 2005-Ohio-5031, \u00b6 29.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Wilkinson attempts to evade a finding of waiver by arguing that, because\n\nOhio is a notice pleading state, her general citation to R.C. 2921.44 was sufficient to place\n\nthe defendants on notice of her claims under R.C. 2921.44(A). We disagree. While\n\nWilkinson\u2019s complaint did make a general reference to R.C. 2921.44, the pleadings\n\nspecifically relied upon subsection (E) as the basis for her right to relief. Furthermore, in\n\ntheir motion to dismiss, consistent with the content of the first amended complaint, Moore\n\nand Santos exclusively argued that subsection (E) did not create liability. If Wilkinson\n\nintended to rely upon a different or additional section of R.C. 2921.44, she had an\n\nobligation to make that argument in her motion in opposition to the motion to dismiss so\n\nthat the trial court could have considered the claim. See Budz at \u00b6 31 (\u201cif the nonmoving\n\nparty fails to raise an issue when responding to the moving party's motion for summary\n\njudgment, the nonmoving party has waived that issue on appeal.\u201d) Accord Tchankpa v.\n\nAscena Retail Group, Inc., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 19AP-760, 2020-Ohio-3291, \u00b6 20\n\f                                                                                           -14-\n\n\n(failure to raise an argument in response to a motion for summary judgment waives the\n\nargument for purposes of appeal). Because Wilkinson failed to raise this argument in\n\nthe trial court, we will not consider it. Again, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision\n\nto dismiss the sixth cause of action alleging civil liability for criminal actions.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} Based upon the record before us, we find Wilkinson\u2019s arguments regarding\n\nthe trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss lack merit. Accordingly, the first assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n\n\n                III.   Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint\n\n       {\u00b6 37} Wilkinson\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:\n\n                THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY OVERRULING APPELLANTS\u2019\n\n       MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} Wilkinson contends the trial court erred by denying her request for leave to\n\nfile a second amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Civ.R. 15(A) provides that a party may amend its pleading once as a matter\n\nof course within 28 days after serving it or within 28 days after service of a Civ.R. 12(B)\n\nmotion, whichever comes first. Absent compliance with these deadlines, a party may\n\namend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or after obtaining leave\n\nof court.   Civ.R. 15(A).     As to amendments requiring leave of court, Civ.R. 15(A)\n\ndemands that \u201c[l]eave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d However,\n\na trial court may properly refuse to grant leave to amend when the amendment would be\n\nfutile.

Montgomery\n\nNo. 27352, 2017-Ohio-5494, \u00b6 8, citing Cruz at \u00b6 34. \u201cWhere, however, the trial court's\n\ndenial of the motion for leave to amend \u2018can fairly be read to have been based on a\n\ndetermination that the amended complaint * * * would not withstand a motion to dismiss,\n\nthe denial is a legal question that is reviewed de novo.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing Marx v. Ohio State\n\nUniv. College of Dentistry, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 95APE07-872, 1996 WL 87462, *3\n\n(Feb. 27, 1996), quoting Rainer v. Westinghouse Elec.

Lucas No. L-99-1351, 2000 WL 1005205, *8 (July\n\n21, 2000) (quoting Rainer).\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Wilkinson argues that the trial court erred by denying her request to amend\n\nher complaint because \u201cmultiple causes of action were and remain available to [her] to\n\nadd to the Amended Complaint, including, but not limited to, Due Process violations, prior\n\nto the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d She further notes that \u201cthe statute of limitations with respect\n\nto potential federal causes of action against all Defendants has yet to lapse.\u201d However,\n\nwe have reviewed the proposed second amended complaint, and it did not add any\n\ncauses of action that were not included in her first amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Further, nothing in the proposed second amended complaint contradicted\n\nthe trial court\u2019s finding that Wilkinson had failed to demonstrate the existence of a duty\n\nthat would save her claims for wrongful death and survivorship. The second amended\n\ncomplaint also did not state any new theories for civil recovery under R.C. 2307.60.\n\nInstead, it relied upon the same claim of dereliction of duty, R.C. 2921.44(E), and did not\n\f                                                                                    -16-\n\n\nadd a claim for dereliction of duty under R.C. 2921.44(A).\n\n       {\u00b6 43} From our review of the record, we conclude the trial court did not err by\n\ndenying Wilkinson\u2019s request to file a second amended complaint.\n\n\n\n                                      IV.    Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Both of Wilkinson\u2019s assignments of error being overruled, the judgment of\n\nthe trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                    .............\n\n\n\nWELBAUM, J. and HUFFMAN, J., concur.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as Wilkinson v.

For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                                                                        -2-\n\n\n\n\n                          I.     Facts and Procedural Background\n\n       {\u00b6 2} This case arises from the shooting deaths of Aisha Nelson and her minor\n\ndaughter Harper Guynn. Because this case was resolved upon a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss, the facts are gleaned from the allegations as set forth in the complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At the time of the shooting, Nelson and Guynn resided at 337 Burleigh\n\nAvenue in Dayton. Waverly \u201cDante\u201d Hawes, with whom Nelson was in a relationship,\n\nalso resided at that address.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} During the evening hours of June 22, 2022, Nelson contacted the Dayton\n\nPolice Department and reported that Hawes had \u201cthreatened her life.\u201d She asked the\n\ndispatcher to have officers meet her at a nearby store \u201cso as not to arouse Hawes\u2019\n\nsuspicions.\u201d   \u201cAfter waiting for some time,\u201d Nelson again called the Dayton Police\n\nDepartment and stated that \u201cshe had seen several police cars, [but] none of them had\n\nstopped. She had her daughter in the vehicle[,] and it was late at night so she advised\n\nthat she was going to go home and would make a report the next day.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 5} During the early morning hours of June 23, 2022, \u201cHawes called police to the\n\nhome on Burleigh and stated he wanted [Nelson] to leave.\u201d Dayton Police Department\n\nOfficers Kathryn Santos and Terrell Moore responded to the residence and spoke with\n\nboth Hawes and Nelson. During her interview, Nelson \u201cinformed Santos that Hawes had\n\nmade multiple threats to her life and that there was a weapon in the house that Hawes\n\nhad easy access to.\u201d She further stated that Hawes had repeatedly \u201cbrandish[ed] a gun\u201d\n\nand \u201cthreatened violence against [her]\u201d in the presence of Guynn and Hawes\u2019s own\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\ndaughter. Nelson stated \u201cthat Hawes was like a \u2018[l]ion in a concrete jungle in here, but\n\nit\u2019s like he locked himself in that basement. He\u2019s down in that basement with his gun\n\nrocking in recliner [sic] back and forth.\u201d Nelson further stated that Hawes had \u201ccut up her\n\ncredit cards and emptied her accounts leaving her with no option of anywhere to go.\u201d\n\nNelson asked the officers to remove Hawes from the home.\n\n      {\u00b6 6} Moore and Santos left the residence at approximately 2:35 a.m. without\n\nmaking an arrest or \u201ctaking a formal report.\u201d At some point between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00\n\na.m., Hawes fatally shot both Nelson and Guynn. Hawes fled the scene, but he was later\n\nfound dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n      {\u00b6 7} Patricia Wilkinson was appointed administrator of the estates of Nelson and\n\nGuynn. Wilkinson filed this action on December 5, 2022. She filed a first amended\n\ncomplaint the following day.     The suit named the City of Dayton, the Dayton City\n\nCommission, the City of Dayton Commissioners, the Dayton Chief of Police, and Officers\n\nMoore and Santos as defendants. The suit also named \u201cJohn and/or Jane Doe(s) 1-10\n\nindividually and as agents of the City of Dayton\u201d as defendants.\n\n      {\u00b6 8} On March 6, 2023, Santos and Moore filed a joint motion to dismiss. The\n\nother defendants also filed motions to dismiss. On April 12, 2023, Wilkinson filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a second amended complaint along with the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint. On April 14, 2023, she filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to\n\ndismiss filed by Moore and Santos. On April 17, 2023, she voluntarily dismissed her\n\nclaims against all defendants except Moore and Santos.\n\n      {\u00b6 9} On May 5, 2023, the trial court granted Moore and Santos\u2019s motion and\n\f                                                                                         -4-\n\n\ndismissed all pending claims against them. The trial court also overruled Wilkinson\u2019s\n\nmotion for leave to file a seconded amended complaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Wilkinson appeals.\n\n\n\n                           II.     Civ.R. 12(B)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b6 11} The first assignment of error asserted by Wilkinson states:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DISMISSING APPELLANTS\u2019 I, III,\n\n       IV, AND VI CLAIMS FOR RELIEF AS INSUFFICIENTLY PLEAD.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Wilkinson claims the trial court erred by granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss filed by Moore and Santos.\n\n                                     A.

In pertinent part,\n\nthe statute states:\n\n       Anyone injured in person or property by a criminal act has, and may recover\n\n       full damages in, a civil action unless specifically excepted by law, may\n\n       recover the costs of maintaining the civil action and attorney&#x27;s fees if\n\n       authorized by any provision of the Rules of Civil Procedure or another\n\n       section of the Revised Code or under the common law of this state, and\n\n       may recover punitive or exemplary damages if authorized by section\n\n       2315.21 or another section of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 29} In the first amended complaint, Wilkerson asserted that Moore and Santos\n\nwere guilty of the crime of dereliction of duty as proscribed by R.C. 2921.44. Specifically,\n\nthat complaint cited R.C. 2921.44(E), which states that \u201c[n]o public servant shall\n\nrecklessly fail to perform a duty expressly imposed by law with respect to the public\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nservant\u2019s office, or recklessly do any act expressly forbidden by law with respect to the\n\npublic servant\u2019s office.\u201d The first amended complaint then asserted that Santos and\n\nMoore \u201cwantonly, willfully, intentionally, maliciously, and not in good faith failed to perform\n\ntheir duties * * *,\u201d and that this failure was \u201ca crime under R.C. 2921.44(F).\u201d From this,\n\nthe first amended complaint asserted a right to recovery under R.C. 2307.60(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 30} In their motion to dismiss, Santos and Moore argued that, to avoid a Civ.R.\n\n12(B)(6) dismissal, Wilkerson had to \u201cidentify a duty expressly imposed by law on * * *\n\nSantos and Moore, the violation of which caused injury.\u201d Santos and Moore then argued\n\nthat, if the first amended complaint asserted that they had a duty to arrest Hawes for\n\ndomestic violence under R.C. 2935.032, this assertion was incorrect because R.C.\n\n2935.032 \u201conly impose[s] an arrest obligation if an officer determine[s] that an offender\n\n[has] committed felonious assault or aggravated assault\u201d; the first amended complaint did\n\nnot contain this allegation.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} The trial court determined that the sixth cause of action was subject to\n\ndismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), reasoning that R.C. 2921.44(E) requires the underlying\n\nstatute \u201cto expressly impose a duty upon the accused; an implied duty is therefore\n\ninsufficient to support a charge of dereliction of duty.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Then, the trial\n\ncourt concluded:\n\n       [Wilkinson] argue[s] [Santos and Moore] had a duty to arrest [Hawes] and/or\n\n       remove him from the premises but fail[s] to point to a duty expressly\n\n       imposed by law. Instead, [Wilkinson] * * * mis-cite[s] laws not imposing an\n\f                                                                                         -12-\n\n\n       express duty to arrest or remove and * * * guideline policies3 created by [the\n\n       Dayton Police Department] which, by their very nature, do not require arrest\n\n       and removal. Therefore, [Wilkinson\u2019s] sixth cause of action is dismissed.\n\n(Emphasis sic.) (Footnote added.)\n\n       {\u00b6 32} We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Based upon the facts set forth\n\nin the first amended complaint, neither the domestic violence statute nor the Dayton\n\nPolice Department domestic violence guidelines imposed an express duty upon Officers\n\nSantos and Moore to arrest Hawes, to remove him from the premises, or to take any other\n\naction. Instead, both the statue and the guidelines state that, under certain circumstances,\n\nan arrest is the \u201cpreferred course of action.\u201d This language clearly gives the officers\n\nsome degree of discretion in determining whether to make an arrest, and thus cannot be\n\nconsidered an express legal duty. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing the sixth cause of action.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Wilkinson also claims the trial court erred in dismissing this cause of action\n\nbecause another section of R.C. 2921.44 provided a basis for liability. Specifically, she\n\nargues that under R.C. 2921.44(A), a law enforcement officer commits the crime of\n\ndereliction of duty when he or she negligently \u201c[f]ail[s] to prevent or halt the commission\n\nof an offense or to apprehend an offender, when it is in the law enforcement officer&#x27;s\n\npower to do so alone or with available assistance.\u201d         Wilkinson contends that this\n\nprovision made the officers\u2019 failure to take action against Hawes a crime.\n\n\n\n3\n Dayton Police Department General Order 2.01-2, which articulates the department\u2019s\ndomestic violence response guidelines, was attached to the first amended complaint as\nExhibit 2.\n\f                                                                                          -13-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 34} However, this argument was not raised by Wilkinson at any time in the trial\n\ncourt. Indeed, she raised it for the first time in her appellate reply brief. \u201c[A]rguments\n\nraised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by an appellate court.\u201d Budz v.\n\nSomerfield, 2d Dist.

We disagree. While\n\nWilkinson\u2019s complaint did make a general reference to R.C. 2921.44, the pleadings\n\nspecifically relied upon subsection (E) as the basis for her right to relief. Furthermore, in\n\ntheir motion to dismiss, consistent with the content of the first amended complaint, Moore\n\nand Santos exclusively argued that subsection (E) did not create liability. If Wilkinson\n\nintended to rely upon a different or additional section of R.C. 2921.44, she had an\n\nobligation to make that argument in her motion in opposition to the motion to dismiss so\n\nthat the trial court could have considered the claim.

Because Wilkinson failed to raise this argument in\n\nthe trial court, we will not consider it. Again, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision\n\nto dismiss the sixth cause of action alleging civil liability for criminal actions.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} Based upon the record before us, we find Wilkinson\u2019s arguments regarding\n\nthe trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss lack merit.

Schwartz, on the brief).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      Defendant appeals from two orders following a bench trial and argues it\n\ndid not have an obligation to continue to pay condominium association dues\n\nbecause plaintiff breached a 2016 settlement agreement by not making repairs\n\nto defendant's units. Defendant also challenges the attorneys' fee award. We\n\nconclude the settlement agreement between the parties did not give defendant\n\nthe right to withhold payment of condominium association dues and affirm the\n\ntrial court's order. We also affirm the award of attorney's fees.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      Empress House is overseen by the Empress House Condominium\n\nAssociation (the Association), a non-profit organization. The complex consists\n\nof 150 residential units and two commercial units.            According to the\n\nAssociation's Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions and bylaws, the size of\n\nthe unit, the percentage of interest in the common elements of Empress House,\n\nand the amount of Association dues all correlate \u2013 the larger the unit the greater\n\nthe association fee. These fees are used by the Association as the annual\n\noperating budget for Empress House, including payment of utilities,\n\nmaintenance and repair of common areas, and staff payroll.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        2\n\f      In March 2013, Turn Bright at Paterson LLC (Turn Bright) purchased the\n\ntwo commercial units for $145,000 and immediately rented out both units to a\n\nchildcare center. By the time of trial, several childcare centers had occupied the\n\nspaces, although they all had difficulty meeting the rental payments.\n\n      The units had historically experienced water issues, including pipe\n\ncondensation and broken or leaky pipes. In the summertime, the pipes above\n\nthe commercial units sweat, condensate, and water drips to the lowest level of\n\nthe building, where the two units were located, causing ceiling leaks. Defendant\n\nwas aware of heating and plumbing issues in the commercial units prior to its\n\npurchase. Despite renovations in March of 2013, water damage persisted in the\n\nform of leaks and floods. Flooding also occurred due to an exterior sewer\n\nbackup. Turn Bright's owner believed the Association was not upholding its\n\nresponsibilities due to the worsening condition of the premises. As a result, Turn\n\nBright stopped paying the monthly Association dues.\n\n      In 2014, Turn Bright sued the Association, alleging it had breached its\n\nduty to maintain and repair the premises. The 2014 litigation was eventually\n\nresolved in a March 18, 2016 Stipulation of Settlement (the 2016 Settlement\n\nAgreement), which was intended to serve as a \"clean-slate\" between the parties.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, Turn Bright agreed to pay the Association five\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        3\n\fmonths' worth of condominium association dues. This effectively resulted in\n\n$97,000 in unpaid dues being forgiven by the Association.\n\n      Turn Bright also agreed to pay all future monthly Association dues\n\nstarting April 1, 2016. These payments were to be made through an \"auto -pay\"\n\nservice.   The Association agreed to earmark $1,000 per month from the\n\nAssociation dues paid by Turn Bright to make repairs to the commercial units.\n\nThe money could be used to repair or prevent future damage to any type of\n\npiping in the ceiling of the units. However, the reserved money was not to be\n\nused for repairs that would ordinarily be considered the burden of the owner.\n\nThere was no agreement between the parties as to which party would oversee or\n\npay for specific repairs.\n\n      The 2016 Settlement Agreement was in force for a 48-month period, from\n\nthe effective date of November 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. In the event either\n\nparty defaulted on any of the material terms of the agreement, the other party\n\nwas entitled to refile the lawsuit claiming funds that may still be due.\n\n      The leaks continued, and in August of 2016 Turn Bright stopped making\n\nits required payments of Association dues. Turn Bright made a few sporadic\n\npayments in September 2017, November 2017, and June 2018 but made no\n\npayments in the intervening months and the following years. As of January 4,\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        4\n\f2021, Turn Bright owed the Association a total of $163,425.27 in unpaid\n\nAssociation dues.\n\n      In January 2017, the Association spent $11,008.13 to make a few interim\n\nrepairs but notified Turn Bright it was awaiting payment of its 2017 dues to\n\nmake further repairs. Turn Bright did not send the funds, and claimed the\n\nproposed work was not the subject of the 2016 Settlement Agreement. The\n\nAssociation continued to make sporadic repairs, including an evaluation of a\n\nblockage and cleaning of the commercial units' sewer line.\n\n      On November 2, 2018, the Association filed a complaint against Turn\n\nBright, seeking payment of the unpaid Association dues. A five-day bench trial\n\nwas conducted. A representative of the Association testified it could not make\n\nthe capital improvements necessary because Turn Bright did not provide\n\nadequate funds. In response, the owner of Turn Bright testified, given the\n\ncontinuation of the water damage, it \"did not have any other legal remedies but\n\nto stop payment.\" Further, he explained that while Turn Bright received rental\n\npayments from March 2016 to April 2019 for one of the units, it was unable to\n\nrent the other unit due to water damage.\n\n      The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Association. It found\n\n\"[t]here [was] no question that there ha[d] been an ongoing problem of water\n\n\n                                                                        A-2049-21\n                                       5\n\finfiltration\" in the two commercial units. It also found the Association's efforts\n\nto rectify the sewer backups, overflows from heavy rainstorms, and clogged\n\ndrains were \"reasonable.\" However, the Association's efforts to respond to and\n\nrepair the condensation-related water issues were \"woefully deficient.\" The\n\ncourt noted the 2016 Settlement Agreement was not specific as to the agreed to\n\nrepairs, when they needed to be completed, or which party was responsible for\n\noverseeing the repairs. Nevertheless, the court explained that water infiltration\n\ncaused by condensation was clearly an issue and the Association's efforts to\n\nrepair the issue had been \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\n      Although the court was critical of the way the Association ran its business,\n\nit determined Turn Bright took advantage of the Association to try \"to evade its\n\nobligations to pay common area maintenance charges.\" It found the Association\n\nwas entitled to recover the unpaid association charges and rejected Turn Bright's\n\nargument that plaintiff was not entitled to association charges pursuant to the\n\ntheory of unclean hands. According to the court, \"[a] unit owner's obligations\n\nto pay common expenses is unconditional.\"\n\n      The court also rejected Turn Bright's contention its damages should be\n\noffset by $168,884.35 for lost rental income. The court found insufficient\n\nevidence to demonstrate the condition of the premises impacted the ability to\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        6\n\frent the space. Instead, it found Turn Bright made no effort to mitigate its\n\ndamages, by either fixing the leaks itself, or attempting to collect rent from or\n\nevicting its non-paying tenants. The court characterized this failure to mitigate\n\nas \"a calculated effort to obtain a windfall similar to what [Turn Bright] did in\n\nthe 2014 suit,\" rejected Turn Bright's counterclaim for offset damages, and\n\nentered a judgment in the amount of $159,151.27 in favor of the Association.\n\n      According to the Association's bylaws, the Board of the Association had\n\nthe right to charge interest on association fees not timely paid. The Board could\n\nalso charge a sum for reasonable counsel fees. Therefore, the court allowed the\n\nAssociation to submit an affidavit detailing the attorneys' fees it had incurred.\n\n      The court determined there was no legal justification for Turn Bright to\n\nhave stopped paying its Association dues and plaintiff was entitled to an award\n\nof attorneys' fees pursuant to its master deed and bylaws. The court noted Turn\n\nBright did not dispute the reasonableness of the attorneys' rate, but rather the\n\naward of fees. Plaintiff's attorneys billed a total of $31,350. After it considered\n\nthe fees \"it deem[ed] necessary for the prosecution of [plaintiff's] case in chief,\"\n\nthe court awarded plaintiff $20,728 in reasonable fees.\n\n      Defendant appeals from both the February 28, 2021 order finding Turn\n\nBright liable in the amount of $159,151.27 for unpaid dues and the March 10,\n\n\n                                                                             A-2049-21\n                                         7\n\f2021 order finding Turn Bright liable for $20,728 in attorneys ' fees. It argues\n\nthe trial court erred by awarding plaintiff all the association fees and charges\n\ndespite finding plaintiff breached its own obligations pursuant to the parties\u2019\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement and failed to apply the governing agreement in its\n\ncalculation of damages owed to the Association. It also argues the trial court\n\nerred in awarding $20,325 in attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff. We disagree and affirm\n\nboth of the trial court's orders.\n\n                                       II.\n\n      Appellate courts review a \"trial court's determinations, premised on the\n\ntestimony of witnesses and written evidence at a bench trial,\" pursuant to a\n\ndeferential standard.

The\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement was intended by the parties to represent a \"clean\n\nslate.\"\n\n      Pursuant to general contract principles, if one party commits a \"breach of\n\na material term of an agreement, the non-breaching party is relieved of its\n\nobligations under the agreement.\" Roach v.

The trial court found the\n\nAssociation's failure to repair the condensation leak issue in a timely manner\n\nconstituted a \"breach\" of the agreement. However, it also held that even if the\n\nAssociation breached the 2016 Settlement Agreement, the agreement did not\n\nallow Turn Bright to stop payment of Association dues. We agree.\n\n      Turn Bright cannot point to any language in the agreement that provided\n\nthat remedy. Turn Bright could have sued the Association for breach of the\n\nagreement, but it did not. Instead, it stopped making payments of Association\n\ndues in August 2016, soon after the agreement was reached. In the agreement\n\nthe Association agreed to \"reserve\" $1,000 per month from Turn Bright's\n\nmonthly dues \"for the purpose of making repairs.\" The Association eventually\n\ncompleted the repairs to resolve the condensation leak issue in May 2020,\n\ndespite Turn Bright's failure to pay Association dues.\n\n      Even if the Association's failure to fix the condensation leak issue by\n\nAugust 2016 amounted to a \"material breach,\" which the trial court did not find,\n\nTurn Bright would not have been permitted to withhold Association dues\n\nbecause the 2016 Settlement Agreement did not expressly allow that remedy.\n\n\n                                                                         A-2049-21\n                                      10\n\fPlaintiff has not pointed to any language in the agreement that would absolve it\n\nof its obligation to make those payments pursuant to the New Jersey\n\nCondominium Act (the Condominium Act). N.J.S.A. 46:8B-1 to -38. In the\n\nabsence of such a contractual provision, we agree with the trial court that the\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement did not afford Turn Bright the right to stop paying\n\nAssociation dues for breach of the agreement. See E. Brunswick Sewerage\n\nAuth. v. E. Mill Assocs., Inc., 365 N.J. Super. 120, 125, 838 A.2d 494, 497\n\n(App. Div. 2004) (citing Washington Const. Co. v. Spinella, 8 N.J. 212, 217\n\n(1951) (explaining \"the court will not make a different or a better contract than\n\nthe parties themselves have seen fit to enter into\")).\n\n      Generally, \"[a] unit owner's obligation to pay common expenses is\n\nunconditional.\" Glen v. June 344 N.J. Super. 371, 377 (App. Div. 2001) (citing\n\nN.J.S.A. 46:8B-17). However, a unit owner may be entitled to damages, as\n\n\"measured by the reasonable value of the loss of use . . . for the period he was\n\ndeprived thereof,\" to be \"set off\" against his outstanding fees. Id. at 380. Turn\n\nBright argues Glen is inapposite because that case involved only the\n\nCondominium Act, whereas Turn Bright's obligation to continue paying\n\nassociation dues arose pursuant to the 2016 Settlement Agreement.             We\n\ndisagree. Turn Bright's obligation to pay Association fees stems from the master\n\n\n                                                                          A-2049-21\n                                       11\n\fdeed and bylaws, not the 2016 Settlement Agreement. Although the agreement\n\nforgave a portion of past dues, it did not address the payment of future fees\n\nexcept to acknowledge that Turn Bright would resume paying dues upon the\n\nexecution of the agreement. That obligation exists by virtue of its ownership of\n\nthe condominium units. Plaintiff's alleged breach of a material term of an\n\nagreement does not relieve defendant of his unconditional obligation to pay\n\nfuture dues.\n\n      Turn Bright had an obligation to continue paying its Association dues, and\n\nbreached its obligation when it stopped making payments in August 2016. The\n\nAssociation's failure to rectify the leakage problems, at least by the time Turn\n\nBright stopped paying its dues, was not a breach of the express terms of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, and, even if it was, Turn Bright would not have been\n\nentitled to withhold payment of Association dues.\n\n      B. The Counterclaim for an offset for damages.\n\n      We also find adequate, credible evidence in the record to support the trial\n\ncourt's determination that Turn Bright did not take reasonable steps to mitigate\n\nits damages by attempting to evict or collect rent from its tenants. We, therefore,\n\naffirm the court's denial of an offset on defendant's counterclaim. In Glen, we\n\nexplained the appropriate remedy available to a unit owner who has suffered\n\n\n                                                                            A-2049-21\n                                       12\n\fdamages as a result of a condominium association's breach. 344 N.J. Super. at\n\n380-81.\n\n      Turn Bright asserted it was entitled to offset $168,884.35 from the damage\n\naward due to lost rental income resulting from the Association's breach of its\n\nobligations. The trial court found defendant did not meet its burden in proving\n\nit took reasonable steps to mitigate damages.       There is sufficient credible\n\nevidence in the record to support the trial court's finding, including the lack of\n\nany effort by Turn Bright to evict its non-paying tenants or pay Association dues\n\ndespite collecting rent on one of the two units.\n\n      C. The Attorneys' Fees.\n\n      Appellate courts review an award of attorney's fees for abuse of discretion.\n\nNoren v. Heartland Payment Sys., Inc., 448 N.J. Super. 486, 497 (App. Div.\n\n2017).

The court noted\n\nTurn Bright did not dispute the reasonableness of the rate or amount of plaintiff's\n\nattorneys' fees.

The complex consists\n\nof 150 residential units and two commercial units.            According to the\n\nAssociation&#x27;s Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions and bylaws, the size of\n\nthe unit, the percentage of interest in the common elements of Empress House,\n\nand the amount of Association dues all correlate \u2013 the larger the unit the greater\n\nthe association fee. These fees are used by the Association as the annual\n\noperating budget for Empress House, including payment of utilities,\n\nmaintenance and repair of common areas, and staff payroll.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        2\n\f      In March 2013, Turn Bright at Paterson LLC (Turn Bright) purchased the\n\ntwo commercial units for $145,000 and immediately rented out both units to a\n\nchildcare center. By the time of trial, several childcare centers had occupied the\n\nspaces, although they all had difficulty meeting the rental payments.\n\n      The units had historically experienced water issues, including pipe\n\ncondensation and broken or leaky pipes. In the summertime, the pipes above\n\nthe commercial units sweat, condensate, and water drips to the lowest level of\n\nthe building, where the two units were located, causing ceiling leaks. Defendant\n\nwas aware of heating and plumbing issues in the commercial units prior to its\n\npurchase. Despite renovations in March of 2013, water damage persisted in the\n\nform of leaks and floods. Flooding also occurred due to an exterior sewer\n\nbackup. Turn Bright&#x27;s owner believed the Association was not upholding its\n\nresponsibilities due to the worsening condition of the premises. As a result, Turn\n\nBright stopped paying the monthly Association dues.\n\n      In 2014, Turn Bright sued the Association, alleging it had breached its\n\nduty to maintain and repair the premises. The 2014 litigation was eventually\n\nresolved in a March 18, 2016 Stipulation of Settlement (the 2016 Settlement\n\nAgreement), which was intended to serve as a &quot;clean-slate&quot; between the parties.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, Turn Bright agreed to pay the Association five\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        3\n\fmonths&#x27; worth of condominium association dues. This effectively resulted in\n\n$97,000 in unpaid dues being forgiven by the Association.\n\n      Turn Bright also agreed to pay all future monthly Association dues\n\nstarting April 1, 2016. These payments were to be made through an &quot;auto -pay&quot;\n\nservice.   The Association agreed to earmark $1,000 per month from the\n\nAssociation dues paid by Turn Bright to make repairs to the commercial units.\n\nThe money could be used to repair or prevent future damage to any type of\n\npiping in the ceiling of the units. However, the reserved money was not to be\n\nused for repairs that would ordinarily be considered the burden of the owner.\n\nThere was no agreement between the parties as to which party would oversee or\n\npay for specific repairs.\n\n      The 2016 Settlement Agreement was in force for a 48-month period, from\n\nthe effective date of November 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. In the event either\n\nparty defaulted on any of the material terms of the agreement, the other party\n\nwas entitled to refile the lawsuit claiming funds that may still be due.\n\n      The leaks continued, and in August of 2016 Turn Bright stopped making\n\nits required payments of Association dues. Turn Bright made a few sporadic\n\npayments in September 2017, November 2017, and June 2018 but made no\n\npayments in the intervening months and the following years. As of January 4,\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        4\n\f2021, Turn Bright owed the Association a total of $163,425.27 in unpaid\n\nAssociation dues.\n\n      In January 2017, the Association spent $11,008.13 to make a few interim\n\nrepairs but notified Turn Bright it was awaiting payment of its 2017 dues to\n\nmake further repairs. Turn Bright did not send the funds, and claimed the\n\nproposed work was not the subject of the 2016 Settlement Agreement. The\n\nAssociation continued to make sporadic repairs, including an evaluation of a\n\nblockage and cleaning of the commercial units&#x27; sewer line.\n\n      On November 2, 2018, the Association filed a complaint against Turn\n\nBright, seeking payment of the unpaid Association dues. A five-day bench trial\n\nwas conducted. A representative of the Association testified it could not make\n\nthe capital improvements necessary because Turn Bright did not provide\n\nadequate funds. In response, the owner of Turn Bright testified, given the\n\ncontinuation of the water damage, it &quot;did not have any other legal remedies but\n\nto stop payment.&quot; Further, he explained that while Turn Bright received rental\n\npayments from March 2016 to April 2019 for one of the units, it was unable to\n\nrent the other unit due to water damage.\n\n      The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Association. It found\n\n&quot;[t]here [was] no question that there ha[d] been an ongoing problem of water\n\n\n                                                                        A-2049-21\n                                       5\n\finfiltration&quot; in the two commercial units. It also found the Association&#x27;s efforts\n\nto rectify the sewer backups, overflows from heavy rainstorms, and clogged\n\ndrains were &quot;reasonable.&quot; However, the Association&#x27;s efforts to respond to and\n\nrepair the condensation-related water issues were &quot;woefully deficient.&quot; The\n\ncourt noted the 2016 Settlement Agreement was not specific as to the agreed to\n\nrepairs, when they needed to be completed, or which party was responsible for\n\noverseeing the repairs. Nevertheless, the court explained that water infiltration\n\ncaused by condensation was clearly an issue and the Association&#x27;s efforts to\n\nrepair the issue had been &quot;unsatisfactory.&quot;\n\n      Although the court was critical of the way the Association ran its business,\n\nit determined Turn Bright took advantage of the Association to try &quot;to evade its\n\nobligations to pay common area maintenance charges.&quot; It found the Association\n\nwas entitled to recover the unpaid association charges and rejected Turn Bright&#x27;s\n\nargument that plaintiff was not entitled to association charges pursuant to the\n\ntheory of unclean hands. According to the court, &quot;[a] unit owner&#x27;s obligations\n\nto pay common expenses is unconditional.&quot;\n\n      The court also rejected Turn Bright&#x27;s contention its damages should be\n\noffset by $168,884.35 for lost rental income. The court found insufficient\n\nevidence to demonstrate the condition of the premises impacted the ability to\n\n\n                                                                           A-2049-21\n                                        6\n\frent the space. Instead, it found Turn Bright made no effort to mitigate its\n\ndamages, by either fixing the leaks itself, or attempting to collect rent from or\n\nevicting its non-paying tenants. The court characterized this failure to mitigate\n\nas &quot;a calculated effort to obtain a windfall similar to what [Turn Bright] did in\n\nthe 2014 suit,&quot; rejected Turn Bright&#x27;s counterclaim for offset damages, and\n\nentered a judgment in the amount of $159,151.27 in favor of the Association.\n\n      According to the Association&#x27;s bylaws, the Board of the Association had\n\nthe right to charge interest on association fees not timely paid. The Board could\n\nalso charge a sum for reasonable counsel fees. Therefore, the court allowed the\n\nAssociation to submit an affidavit detailing the attorneys&#x27; fees it had incurred.\n\n      The court determined there was no legal justification for Turn Bright to\n\nhave stopped paying its Association dues and plaintiff was entitled to an award\n\nof attorneys&#x27; fees pursuant to its master deed and bylaws. The court noted Turn\n\nBright did not dispute the reasonableness of the attorneys&#x27; rate, but rather the\n\naward of fees. Plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys billed a total of $31,350. After it considered\n\nthe fees &quot;it deem[ed] necessary for the prosecution of [plaintiff&#x27;s] case in chief,&quot;\n\nthe court awarded plaintiff $20,728 in reasonable fees.\n\n      Defendant appeals from both the February 28, 2021 order finding Turn\n\nBright liable in the amount of $159,151.27 for unpaid dues and the March 10,\n\n\n                                                                             A-2049-21\n                                         7\n\f2021 order finding Turn Bright liable for $20,728 in attorneys &#x27; fees. It argues\n\nthe trial court erred by awarding plaintiff all the association fees and charges\n\ndespite finding plaintiff breached its own obligations pursuant to the parties\u2019\n\n2016 Settlement Agreement and failed to apply the governing agreement in its\n\ncalculation of damages owed to the Association. It also argues the trial court\n\nerred in awarding $20,325 in attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff.

The trial court found the\n\nAssociation&#x27;s failure to repair the condensation leak issue in a timely manner\n\nconstituted a &quot;breach&quot; of the agreement. However, it also held that even if the\n\nAssociation breached the 2016 Settlement Agreement, the agreement did not\n\nallow Turn Bright to stop payment of Association dues. We agree.\n\n      Turn Bright cannot point to any language in the agreement that provided\n\nthat remedy. Turn Bright could have sued the Association for breach of the\n\nagreement, but it did not. Instead, it stopped making payments of Association\n\ndues in August 2016, soon after the agreement was reached. In the agreement\n\nthe Association agreed to &quot;reserve&quot; $1,000 per month from Turn Bright&#x27;s\n\nmonthly dues &quot;for the purpose of making repairs.&quot; The Association eventually\n\ncompleted the repairs to resolve the condensation leak issue in May 2020,\n\ndespite Turn Bright&#x27;s failure to pay Association dues.\n\n      Even if the Association&#x27;s failure to fix the condensation leak issue by\n\nAugust 2016 amounted to a &quot;material breach,&quot; which the trial court did not find,\n\nTurn Bright would not have been permitted to withhold Association dues\n\nbecause the 2016 Settlement Agreement did not expressly allow that remedy.\n\n\n                                                                         A-2049-21\n                                      10\n\fPlaintiff has not pointed to any language in the agreement that would absolve it\n\nof its obligation to make those payments pursuant to the New Jersey\n\nCondominium Act (the Condominium Act).

Turn\n\nBright argues Glen is inapposite because that case involved only the\n\nCondominium Act, whereas Turn Bright&#x27;s obligation to continue paying\n\nassociation dues arose pursuant to the 2016 Settlement Agreement.             We\n\ndisagree. Turn Bright&#x27;s obligation to pay Association fees stems from the master\n\n\n                                                                          A-2049-21\n                                       11\n\fdeed and bylaws, not the 2016 Settlement Agreement. Although the agreement\n\nforgave a portion of past dues, it did not address the payment of future fees\n\nexcept to acknowledge that Turn Bright would resume paying dues upon the\n\nexecution of the agreement. That obligation exists by virtue of its ownership of\n\nthe condominium units. Plaintiff&#x27;s alleged breach of a material term of an\n\nagreement does not relieve defendant of his unconditional obligation to pay\n\nfuture dues.\n\n      Turn Bright had an obligation to continue paying its Association dues, and\n\nbreached its obligation when it stopped making payments in August 2016. The\n\nAssociation&#x27;s failure to rectify the leakage problems, at least by the time Turn\n\nBright stopped paying its dues, was not a breach of the express terms of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, and, even if it was, Turn Bright would not have been\n\nentitled to withhold payment of Association dues.\n\n      B. The Counterclaim for an offset for damages.\n\n      We also find adequate, credible evidence in the record to support the trial\n\ncourt&#x27;s determination that Turn Bright did not take reasonable steps to mitigate\n\nits damages by attempting to evict or collect rent from its tenants. We, therefore,\n\naffirm the court&#x27;s denial of an offset on defendant&#x27;s counterclaim. In Glen, we\n\nexplained the appropriate remedy available to a unit owner who has suffered\n\n\n                                                                            A-2049-21\n                                       12\n\fdamages as a result of a condominium association&#x27;s breach. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2386420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2386420/glen-v-june/\">344 N.J.

Plaintiff appeals from a December 10, 2021 order granting the\n\nsummary judgment motion of defendants Wingate Vineland, Roth 55\n\nDevelopment Corp., Edward Roth, and Henry Roth (collectively the\n\ndefendants), and a January 22, 2022 order denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration. We affirm.\n\n      The facts in this case are not in dispute. Plaintiff was employed by\n\nOsmose Utilities Services, Inc. as a technician and worked alongside his friend\n\nand roommate, Ivan Scott Strayer, at the time of Strayer's murder. Plaintiff,\n\nStrayer, and other utility workers were assigned to work crews and traveled to\n\nvarious locations around the country, living together in hotels while on\n\nassignment. According to plaintiff, the crew led by Mark Knowles had worked\n\non five to six different sites before October 2016. Plaintiff and Strayer had been\n\nhotel roommates on the prior ten to twelve work assignments.           They also\n\nsocialized frequently outside of work. Plaintiff was the best man at Strayer's\n\nwedding. Plaintiff considered Strayer family, knew his wife, and attended his\n\nfamily functions.\n\n      Approximately one month before Strayer's murder, plaintiff and other\n\nmembers of the Osmose work crew checked into the Wingate Hotel in Vineland.\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                        3\n\fKnowles always made their hotel reservations and took the lead in making their\n\nroom assignments. The crew, consisting of five crew members, checked into\n\nthe hotel together, and included plaintiff, Strayer, Knowles, Charles Pulcine\n\n(Chuck), and his brother Larry Pulcine (Larry), who had recently joined the\n\ncrew. Knowles spoke to the front desk clerk while the remaining crew members\n\nprovided their identification to the front desk clerk and \"wrote on some\n\ncard . . . who was in which room.\" The crew members were assigned to three\n\nrooms as follows: plaintiff and Strayer were assigned Room 404, the Pulcine\n\nbrothers were assigned Room 405, and Knowles was assigned Room 406.\n\n      On the evening of October 10, 2016, plaintiff had gone to Bennigan's\n\nRestaurant, located in front of the hotel, to eat dinner and watch a baseball game.\n\nHe went alone, but Strayer eventually met him at the restaurant. Strayer left the\n\nrestaurant and returned to the hotel between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. while plaintiff\n\nstayed to watch the end of the baseball game. When plaintiff returned to their\n\nhotel room around 10:00 p.m., he observed the television was on, and Strayer\n\nappeared to be sleeping. That same evening plaintiff received a text message\n\nfrom Chuck around 10:03 p.m. inviting him to hang out and drink some beers in\n\nhis room. At approximately 10:05 p.m., plaintiff went to the Pulcines' room,\n\nalthough he briefly returned to his room to grab a few beers. He did not make\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                        4\n\fany observations of Strayer at that time. He then returned to the Pulcines' room,\n\nwhere he stayed until approximately 11:30 p.m.\n\n      While plaintiff was in the Pulcines' room, Larry left for approximately\n\nthirty minutes, stating he was going to do laundry, and when he returned, Larry\n\nwas \"shooting his mouth off to [plaintiff] . . . [plaintiff] wasn't in a good mood[,]\n\nso [plaintiff] just left.\" When plaintiff finally returned to his room, he noticed\n\nthe television was off but did not make any observation of, or hear anything\n\nfrom, Strayer at that time and \"[w]ent to bed. . . . [and] didn't turn on the light\n\nor anything . . . .\"\n\n      On October 11, 2016, plaintiff woke up around 5:00 to 5:15 a.m. and\n\nStrayer was still in bed, which was unusual because Strayer \"was normally up\n\nbefore [plaintiff].\" Plaintiff said:\n\n                       [I] looked over and . . . saw [Strayer's],\n                       eyes were open, but he was not\u2014nothing\n                       really going on, you know. So I ran over,\n                       grabbed his foot. It was ice cold. And,\n                       then I went to\u2014I grabbed his arm and\n                       checked his pulse twice. I'll never forget\n                       the noise it made. And I . . . panicked so I\n                       ran out of the room. Went to Mark's\n                       room . . . told him what I saw . . . And, I []\n                       it was wild 'cause I mean, I didn't even\n                       think [] I didn't hear anything, didn't see\n                       any[.]\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                             5\n\fAccording to plaintiff, he felt shocked at finding his friend's body and fear for\n\nhis own safety. Plaintiff later learned Strayer had been shot with a handgun.\n\nPlaintiff did not witness the murder and did not encounter the murderer in his\n\nhotel room. He was not physically harmed.\n\n      Larry was taken into police custody after video surveillance from the\n\nhotel's front lobby area revealed that at approximately 10:00 p.m. on October\n\n10, 2016, the Pulcine brothers had entered the lobby and approached the front\n\ndesk. According to the police report, the front desk clerk on duty at the time\n\ncreated two keycards: one for room 404 and another for room 405 at around\n\n10:00 p.m. and Charles took possession of the keycards from the clerk.\n\nAccording to the keycard access log, the new keycard for Room 404 given to\n\nthe Pulcines was used to access Room 404 at 10:28 p.m. A responding police\n\ndetective estimated that Strayer was shot between 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\n\nwhile plaintiff was across the hall in Room 405.       Larry was subsequently\n\narrested for, charged with, and convicted of Strayer's murder.\n\n      Strayer's wife brought a wrongful death and survivorship action under\n\nN.J.S.A. 2A:31-2 and 2A:15-3 against defendants, while plaintiff brought a\n\nseparate action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Both matters were\n\nconsolidated and proceeded to discovery where the parties retained liability and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                       6\n\fmedical experts and took depositions. Strayer's wife's claims have since been\n\nsettled.\n\n      Plaintiff retained an expert on hotel management and operations and a\n\nmedical expert. His hotel management and operations expert, Kenneth Free,\n\nopined that \"the Wingate Hotel was aware of its safety obligations and deviated\n\nfrom the industry standard of care that created a foreseeable risk of harm to the\n\nhotel\u2019s guests.\" Free explained Larry's criminal acts are the type of criminal\n\nactivity that adequate safety and security measures are intended to prevent and\n\nwere, therefore, foreseeable. Free concluded that the failure to identify or\n\nproperly register the Osmose crew was inconsistent with proper keycard control\n\nand resulted in a foreseeable risk of harm to guests, and the implementation and\n\nenforcement of a proper keycard control protocol system could have prevented\n\nLarry's unauthorized entry into plaintiff's and Strayer\u2019s room.\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on October 7, 2021.               On\n\nDecember 10, 2021, the motion judge heard argument, after which he rendered\n\nhis decision from the bench. The motion judge found that plaintiff had failed to\n\ndemonstrate defendants' actions proximately caused plaintiff's emotional\n\ninjuries. He found plaintiff's injuries were \"not based upon the handing of a\n\nkeycard\" and that neither defendants nor their employees \"cause[d] any of the\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                        7\n\femotional distresses being suffered by plaintiff.\"        He acknowledged that\n\ndefendants' employee \"shouldn\u2019t have given the keycard to Mr. Pulcine\" but\n\nsubsequently concluded:\n\n            you know, they were all friends. They had been in the\n            hotel. They were seen together and all those things.\n            It\u2019s not like they gave the keycard to a stranger, but\n            putting that all aside, the Defendants here didn\u2019t cause,\n            whether negligently, intentionally or recklessly, any of\n            the emotional distress caused\u2014that Plaintiff is now\n            suffering from.\n\nIn his brief discussion of the law, the motion judge also relied on Falzone v.\n\nBusch, 45 N.J. 559, 561 (1965), to support his causation determination, stating:\n\n            when you come to emotional distress types of claims\n            as, you know, started in this road down with Falzone\n            and its been kind of muddled by subsequent cases, there\n            still has to be the requirement that the [d]efendants are\n            the ones that caused the emotional distress.

And I think that\u2019s really what Falzone talks\n            about at least initially, not directly, but I mean, I think\n            it\u2019s obviously inherent in it that it\u2019s the [d]efendants\n            that cause it.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n                                        I.\n\n      We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same\n\nstandard as the trial court.

Co., 234 N.J. 459, 472 (2018).\n\n        A. Bystander Claim for Negligent Infliction of Emotional\n           Distress.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff argues the motion judge erred by ruling that, as a\n\nmatter of law, plaintiff's emotional injuries were solely caused by the actions of\n\nLarry and that defendants' negligence did not cause his alleged injuries.\n\nAccording to plaintiff, the motion judge erroneously \"based [his] grant of\n\nsummary judgment entirely upon [his] determination that defendants' negligence\n\nin giving the keycard to [plaintiff's] hotel room to an unauthorized individual,\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                        9\n\fwho used the keycard to access the room and murder [Strayer], did not\n\nproximately cause any emotional distress to [plaintiff].\"\n\n      Plaintiff continues to assert, as he did at summary judgment, that this case\n\nis not a Portee v. Jaffee, 84 N.J. 88 (1980), bystander claim of negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress. Instead, he avers he is entitled to recover based\n\non a theory of direct negligence.\n\n      In Portee, our Supreme Court recognized a cause of action for the unique\n\nemotional distress suffered by a mother as she watched her seven-year-old son\n\ndie an excruciating death, trapped in a malfunctioning elevator shaft. 84 N.J. at\n\n91-92. Portee marked a pivotal development in the law, creating an exception\n\nthat allowed bystanders to recover damages for emotional injuries based on the\n\ntheory of negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Court considered the\n\nfacts that police attempted to rescue the child for four and a half hours, and the\n\nplaintiff had to endure witnessing her son \"moan, cr[y] out, and flail his arms.\"\n\nIbid. The plaintiff's son eventually died during the rescue attempt, and as a\n\nresult, the plaintiff \"became severely depressed and seriously self-destructive,\"\n\nculminating in an unsuccessful attempt to take her own life, which \"required\n\nconsiderable physical therapy and . . . [she] received extensive counseling and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                       10\n\fpsychotherapy to help overcome the mental and emotional problems caused by\n\nher son's death.\" Ibid.\n\n      Plaintiff disputes defendants' contention that the analysis set forth in\n\nPortee is applicable. Instead, he maintains defendants owed him a direct duty\n\nof care, the same duty of care that was owed to Strayer as a guest of the hotel,\n\nthere was a breach of the duty of care to him and Strayer, and that breach\n\nproximately caused him severe emotional distress.\n\n      Defendants frame this issue as one that must be analyzed pursuant to\n\nPortee. Confronted with a set of facts where a bystander suffered emotional\n\ndistress as a result of witnessing the death of her child, the Portee Court set forth\n\na four-factor test for bystander negligent infliction of emotional distress claims:\n\n\"(1) the death or serious physical injury of another caused by defendant's\n\nnegligence; (2) a marital or intimate, familial relationship between plaintiff and\n\nthe injured person; (3) observation of the death or injury at the scene of the\n\naccident; and (4) resulting severe emotional distress.\" Id. at 101. Defendants\n\nmaintain that plaintiff cannot satisfy an essential element of a Portee claim\n\nbecause plaintiff and Strayer lacked the requisite familial relationship, despite\n\ntheir personal friendship and plaintiff's claim that he considered Strayer family.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                        11\n\f      Defendants further note that our Supreme Court in McDougall v. Lamm\n\nreaffirmed Portee's narrow application to specified relationships, namely\n\n\"marital or intimate, familial relationship[s],\" when it denied the plaintiff\n\nrecovery for emotional distress suffered as result of witnessing the death of a\n\npet. 211 N.J. 203, 229 (2012). The Court emphasized that Portee claims have\n\nbeen limited to relationships with a \"plain and obvious emotional bond,\" such\n\nas between a \"parent, child, spouse, or an individual with whom one shares a\n\nmarital-like or intimate familial relationship[.]\" Ibid. Thus, defendants aver the\n\nrelationship between the co-workers here does not rise to the level required by\n\nPortee.\n\n      Although we recognize that the relationship between Strayer and plaintiff\n\nmay be more than that of mere co-workers, it does not rise to the level required\n\nby Portee, and we see no basis to relax the Supreme Court's requirement of a\n\n\"marital-like or intimate familial relationship.\" McDougall, 211 N.J. at 229.\n\nThus, plaintiff did not, and cannot, establish a claim under Portee for negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n          B. Direct Claim for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.\n\n      Plaintiff concedes he cannot sustain his burden under Portee, but argues\n\nthe court nonetheless erred in granting defendant summary judgment because he\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                       12\n\fhas a direct claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress based on\n\ndefendants' breach of a duty it owed directly to him. The argument ignores the\n\nlimited bases supporting a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Jablonowski v. Suther, held:\n\n            Generally, then, an individual can maintain an\n            independent tort action for negligent infliction of\n            emotional distress in two instances. A plaintiff can\n            demonstrate that the defendant's negligent conduct\n            placed the plaintiff in reasonable fear of immediate\n            personal injury, which gave rise to emotional distress\n            that resulted in a substantial bodily injury or sickness.\n            See Falzone, 45 N.J. at 569. Alternatively, a plaintiff\n            can state a prima facie claim for negligent infliction of\n            emotional distress by satisfying the four elements set\n            forth in Portee.\n\n            [195 N.J. 91, 104 (2008); accord Abousaid v. Mansard\n            Gardens Assocs., LLC, 207 N.J. 67, 76-77 (2011).]\n\n      Plaintiff contends he is entitled to recover damages based on a direct claim\n\nof negligent infliction of emotional distress that follows traditional negligence\n\nanalysis, which he claims \"can be understood as negligent conduct that is the\n\nproximate cause of emotional distress in a person to whom the actor owes a legal\n\nduty to exercise reasonable care.\" Russo v. Nagel, 358 N.J. Super. 254, 269-70\n\n(App. Div. 2003) (quoting Decker v. Princeton Packet, 116 N.J. 418, 429\n\n(1989)).\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                       13\n\f      Here, plaintiff relies on Falzone, 45 N.J. 559, Strachan v. John F. Kennedy\n\nMemorial Hospital, 109 N.J. 523 (1988), and Lascurian v. City of Newark, 349\n\nN.J. Super. 251, 277 (App. Div. 2002). He distinguishes these cases from the\n\nPortee line of cases, arguing that defendants owed a duty directly to him\u2014as a\n\nguest in their hotel\u2014that included not giving keycard access to his room to any\n\nother person.    Plaintiff argues that defendants, through their negligent\n\ndistribution of the keycard, breached a duty owed directly to him, and are\n\ntherefore liable for his emotional distress damages. Ibid.\n\n      Defendants argue that under Falzone's \"zone of danger\" test, 45 N.J. at\n\n569, plaintiff cannot show he was in imminent fear of harm. In Falzone, the\n\ndefendant-motorist's car struck the plaintiff's husband, who was standing in a\n\nfield as the plaintiff sat in her car, which was parked nearby. 45 N.J. at 561.\n\nThe plaintiff observed the oncoming car, although she was not physically struck\n\nor injured. The plaintiff's husband suffered serious injuries as a result of the\n\ncollision. The plaintiff filed suit, alleging negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress for having witnessed her husband's injuries and because she was also in\n\nfear of her own bodily injury as she witnessed the accident. The trial court\n\ngranted the defendant summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                      14\n\f      However, the Court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment\n\nto the defendant and held a plaintiff could recover for bodily injury or sickness\n\nresulting from fear for her own safety caused by a negligent defendant where\n\nshe was placed in danger by such negligence, although there was no physical\n\nimpact. Id. at 569.\n\n      By eschewing the \"prior inflexible requirement of physical impact,\"\n\nFalzone expanded the potential reach of liability for claims for emotional\n\ndistress \"where negligence causes fright from a reasonable fear of immediate\n\npersonal injury.\" Ibid.; see also Portee, 84 N.J. at 934. Plaintiff relies on the\n\nCourt's reasoning and holding in Falzone for the proposition that, like the\n\nplaintiff in Falzone, who the Court recognized had been equally \"fearful of\n\nimmediate injury\" because of her proximity to her husband when he was struck\n\nby the defendant's vehicle, he was in the zone of danger by virtue of sharing the\n\nsame hotel room and awaking to find the body of his murdered friend and co-\n\nworker.\n\n      Plaintiff also maintains that the Court's reasoning in Falzone is equally\n\napplicable here because although not physically injured, he suffered emotional\n\nharm by virtue of being fearful of immediate injury when he realized his\n\nroommate and friend was dead in the bed next to him. He, therefore, seeks\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                      15\n\freversal of the order granting summary judgment to defendants, arguing that\n\nunder Falzone, witnesses to harm suffered by others can establish liability on\n\nthe contention that they were \"fearful of immediate injury.\"\n\n      The problem with plaintiff's argument is that Falzone, as the Court\n\nrecognized in Portee, 84 N.J. at 93, Jablonowska, 195 N.J. at 104, and Abousaid,\n\n207 N.J. at 77, requires a plaintiff to demonstrate \"a reasonable fear of\n\nimmediate personal injury,\" Falzone, 45 N.J. at 569, and plaintiff has failed to\n\nmake that showing. Plaintiff understandably may have felt shock and even fear\n\nwhen he discovered his roommate's dead body, but the evidence in the record\n\ndoes not establish he had a \"reasonable fear of immediate personal injury.\" Ibid.\n\nTo the contrary, plaintiff testified he \"didn't even think . . . didn't hear anything,\n\ndidn't see any[thing]\" in the moments after he found Strayer's dead body in the\n\nhotel room.\n\n      As the record shows, plaintiff was not present when Strayer was murdered,\n\nplaintiff did not encounter the murderer in his hotel room, Strayer's body was\n\n\"ice cold\" when plaintiff touched it, and plaintiff was not even aware that Strayer\n\nhad been murdered until he was so advised by investigating officers later in the\n\nday. According to plaintiff's deposition testimony, when he returned to his room\n\nthe night of the murder, all the lights were off, and he \"used [his] phone light to\n\n\n                                                                                A-0787-22\n                                         16\n\fguide [him] to [his] bed so as to not disturb Strayer,\" whom he believed was\n\nsleeping. He then \"put [his] phone on the . . . nightstand and [he] crawl[ed] into\n\nbed\" to go to sleep. It was only when he awoke early the next morning that he\n\nsaw Strayer was still in bed and eventually realized that something was wrong.\n\nHe then \"ran up to him, grabbed his foot, leg\" and \"pushed his chest and checked\n\nhis pulse twice.\" And, once he realized Strayer was unresponsive, he testified,\n\n\"obviously, I didn't know what to do\" and \"didn't know what was [going] on\"\n\nand \"just\u2014ran out.\" Plaintiff also testified that it was his understanding when\n\nhe discovered Strayer's body that \"he had passed away[, but he] didn't know that\n\nhe was shot.\" A police officer called to the scene later told plaintiff, who was\n\nthen sitting in the hallway, that Strayer had been shot with a handgun. On these\n\nfacts, plaintiff has not demonstrated that he had a reasonable fear of any personal\n\ninjury, never mind the requisite \"reasonable fear of immediate personal injury.\"\n\nIbid. see also Jablonowski, 195 N.J. at 104.\n\n      Based upon these undisputed facts, we cannot conclude that the principles\n\nof liability addressed in Falzone support plaintiff's cause of action. We also\n\nconsider that based upon plaintiff's own testimony, for all he knew at the time,\n\nStayer could have died from natural causes. He was understandably distraught,\n\nconfused, and in shock, but those facts do not establish that he was in the zone\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                       17\n\fof danger or reasonably fearful of immediate harm, under the principles\n\nexplained in Falzone.1\n\n      Plaintiff concedes that he does not have a claim or cause of action under\n\nPortee, and we otherwise conclude he cannot sustain his burden of proving a\n\nPortee claim. We also find he cannot otherwise sustain the asserted negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress claim because he failed to present any evidence\n\nhe suffered a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury under Falzone. See\n\nFriedman v. Martinez, 242 N.J. 449, 472 (2020) (\"Summary judgment should be\n\ngranted . . . 'against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish\n\nthe existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party\n\nwill bear the burden of proof at trial.'\") (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n\nU.S. 317, 322 (1986)).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff's reliance on Strachan, 109 N.J. 523, and Lascurian, 349 N.J. Super. 251,\nis also misplaced.

Plaintiff appeals from a December 10, 2021 order granting the\n\nsummary judgment motion of defendants Wingate Vineland, Roth 55\n\nDevelopment Corp., Edward Roth, and Henry Roth (collectively the\n\ndefendants), and a January 22, 2022 order denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration. We affirm.\n\n      The facts in this case are not in dispute. Plaintiff was employed by\n\nOsmose Utilities Services, Inc. as a technician and worked alongside his friend\n\nand roommate, Ivan Scott Strayer, at the time of Strayer&#x27;s murder. Plaintiff,\n\nStrayer, and other utility workers were assigned to work crews and traveled to\n\nvarious locations around the country, living together in hotels while on\n\nassignment. According to plaintiff, the crew led by Mark Knowles had worked\n\non five to six different sites before October 2016. Plaintiff and Strayer had been\n\nhotel roommates on the prior ten to twelve work assignments.           They also\n\nsocialized frequently outside of work. Plaintiff was the best man at Strayer&#x27;s\n\nwedding. Plaintiff considered Strayer family, knew his wife, and attended his\n\nfamily functions.\n\n      Approximately one month before Strayer&#x27;s murder, plaintiff and other\n\nmembers of the Osmose work crew checked into the Wingate Hotel in Vineland.\n\n\n                                                                            A-0787-22\n                                        3\n\fKnowles always made their hotel reservations and took the lead in making their\n\nroom assignments. The crew, consisting of five crew members, checked into\n\nthe hotel together, and included plaintiff, Strayer, Knowles, Charles Pulcine\n\n(Chuck), and his brother Larry Pulcine (Larry), who had recently joined the\n\ncrew. Knowles spoke to the front desk clerk while the remaining crew members\n\nprovided their identification to the front desk clerk and &quot;wrote on some\n\ncard . . . who was in which room.&quot; The crew members were assigned to three\n\nrooms as follows: plaintiff and Strayer were assigned Room 404, the Pulcine\n\nbrothers were assigned Room 405, and Knowles was assigned Room 406.\n\n      On the evening of October 10, 2016, plaintiff had gone to Bennigan&#x27;s\n\nRestaurant, located in front of the hotel, to eat dinner and watch a baseball game.\n\nHe went alone, but Strayer eventually met him at the restaurant. Strayer left the\n\nrestaurant and returned to the hotel between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. while plaintiff\n\nstayed to watch the end of the baseball game. When plaintiff returned to their\n\nhotel room around 10:00 p.m., he observed the television was on, and Strayer\n\nappeared to be sleeping. That same evening plaintiff received a text message\n\nfrom Chuck around 10:03 p.m. inviting him to hang out and drink some beers in\n\nhis room. At approximately 10:05 p.m., plaintiff went to the Pulcines&#x27; room,\n\nalthough he briefly returned to his room to grab a few beers. He did not make\n\n\n                                                                             A-0787-22\n                                        4\n\fany observations of Strayer at that time. He then returned to the Pulcines&#x27; room,\n\nwhere he stayed until approximately 11:30 p.m.\n\n      While plaintiff was in the Pulcines&#x27; room, Larry left for approximately\n\nthirty minutes, stating he was going to do laundry, and when he returned, Larry\n\nwas &quot;shooting his mouth off to [plaintiff] . . . [plaintiff] wasn&#x27;t in a good mood[,]\n\nso [plaintiff] just left.&quot; When plaintiff finally returned to his room, he noticed\n\nthe television was off but did not make any observation of, or hear anything\n\nfrom, Strayer at that time and &quot;[w]ent to bed. . . . [and] didn&#x27;t turn on the light\n\nor anything . . . .&quot;\n\n      On October 11, 2016, plaintiff woke up around 5:00 to 5:15 a.m. and\n\nStrayer was still in bed, which was unusual because Strayer &quot;was normally up\n\nbefore [plaintiff].&quot; Plaintiff said:\n\n                       [I] looked over and . . . saw [Strayer&#x27;s],\n                       eyes were open, but he was not\u2014nothing\n                       really going on, you know. So I ran over,\n                       grabbed his foot. It was ice cold. And,\n                       then I went to\u2014I grabbed his arm and\n                       checked his pulse twice. I&#x27;ll never forget\n                       the noise it made. And I . . . panicked so I\n                       ran out of the room. Went to Mark&#x27;s\n                       room . . . told him what I saw . . . And, I []\n                       it was wild &#x27;cause I mean, I didn&#x27;t even\n                       think [] I didn&#x27;t hear anything, didn&#x27;t see\n                       any[.]\n\n\n\n                                                                               A-0787-22\n                                             5\n\fAccording to plaintiff, he felt shocked at finding his friend&#x27;s body and fear for\n\nhis own safety. Plaintiff later learned Strayer had been shot with a handgun.\n\nPlaintiff did not witness the murder and did not encounter the murderer in his\n\nhotel room. He was not physically harmed.\n\n      Larry was taken into police custody after video surveillance from the\n\nhotel&#x27;s front lobby area revealed that at approximately 10:00 p.m. on October\n\n10, 2016, the Pulcine brothers had entered the lobby and approached the front\n\ndesk. According to the police report, the front desk clerk on duty at the time\n\ncreated two keycards: one for room 404 and another for room 405 at around\n\n10:00 p.m. and Charles took possession of the keycards from the clerk.\n\nAccording to the keycard access log, the new keycard for Room 404 given to\n\nthe Pulcines was used to access Room 404 at 10:28 p.m. A responding police\n\ndetective estimated that Strayer was shot between 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\n\nwhile plaintiff was across the hall in Room 405.       Larry was subsequently\n\narrested for, charged with, and convicted of Strayer&#x27;s murder.\n\n      Strayer&#x27;s wife brought a wrongful death and survivorship action under\n\nN.J.S.A. 2A:31-2 and 2A:15-3 against defendants, while plaintiff brought a\n\nseparate action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Both matters were\n\nconsolidated and proceeded to discovery where the parties retained liability and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                       6\n\fmedical experts and took depositions. Strayer&#x27;s wife&#x27;s claims have since been\n\nsettled.\n\n      Plaintiff retained an expert on hotel management and operations and a\n\nmedical expert. His hotel management and operations expert, Kenneth Free,\n\nopined that &quot;the Wingate Hotel was aware of its safety obligations and deviated\n\nfrom the industry standard of care that created a foreseeable risk of harm to the\n\nhotel\u2019s guests.&quot; Free explained Larry&#x27;s criminal acts are the type of criminal\n\nactivity that adequate safety and security measures are intended to prevent and\n\nwere, therefore, foreseeable. Free concluded that the failure to identify or\n\nproperly register the Osmose crew was inconsistent with proper keycard control\n\nand resulted in a foreseeable risk of harm to guests, and the implementation and\n\nenforcement of a proper keycard control protocol system could have prevented\n\nLarry&#x27;s unauthorized entry into plaintiff&#x27;s and Strayer\u2019s room.\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on October 7, 2021.               On\n\nDecember 10, 2021, the motion judge heard argument, after which he rendered\n\nhis decision from the bench. The motion judge found that plaintiff had failed to\n\ndemonstrate defendants&#x27; actions proximately caused plaintiff&#x27;s emotional\n\ninjuries. He found plaintiff&#x27;s injuries were &quot;not based upon the handing of a\n\nkeycard&quot; and that neither defendants nor their employees &quot;cause[d] any of the\n\n\n                                                                           A-0787-22\n                                        7\n\femotional distresses being suffered by plaintiff.&quot;        He acknowledged that\n\ndefendants&#x27; employee &quot;shouldn\u2019t have given the keycard to Mr. Pulcine&quot; but\n\nsubsequently concluded:\n\n            you know, they were all friends. They had been in the\n            hotel. They were seen together and all those things.\n            It\u2019s not like they gave the keycard to a stranger, but\n            putting that all aside, the Defendants here didn\u2019t cause,\n            whether negligently, intentionally or recklessly, any of\n            the emotional distress caused\u2014that Plaintiff is now\n            suffering from.\n\nIn his brief discussion of the law, the motion judge also relied on Falzone v.\n\nBusch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518650\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518650/falzone-v-busch/\">45 N.J. 559</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (1965), to support his causation determination, stating:\n\n            when you come to emotional distress types of claims\n            as, you know, started in this road down with Falzone\n            and its been kind of muddled by subsequent cases, there\n            still has to be the requirement that the [d]efendants are\n            the ones that caused the emotional distress.

Kelsey, appellant pro se.\n\n                   Adam M. Schneider, attorney for respondents.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n          Plaintiff appeals from the January 19, 2022 order denying his motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint which was dismissed without prejudice in June 2021.\n\fThe June 2021 order was issued sua sponte and stated if plaintiff did not file a\n\ncomplaint for guardianship, the dismissal would convert to a dismissal with\n\nprejudice. We conclude the court should have granted plaintiff's motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint. Therefore, we reverse and remand for the trial court to\n\nset a preemptory trial date.\n\n         The parties are neighbors and have a longstanding dispute regarding their\n\nproperty line. After defendants installed a fence in 2006 or 2007, plaintiff asked\n\nthem to remove it, claiming the fence was on his property. Defendants did not\n\ndo so.\n\n         In 2011, defendants sought permission from the East Hanover Land Use\n\nBoard (Board) to construct a two-story addition on their home. Their application\n\nincluded requests for certain variances. Plaintiff objected to the application,\n\nraising the property line dispute. Defendants withdrew the application.\n\n         In April 2019, defendants applied to the Board for permission to construct\n\na one-story addition on their house, with variances for setbacks and location of\n\na garage. Plaintiff again objected to the application, reiterating the continued\n\ndispute regarding the property line, and asserting a discrepancy between the\n\nparties' surveys. The Board approved defendants' application with amendments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                          2\n\f        Thereafter, the self-represented plaintiff filed a complaint against\n\ndefendants asserting causes of action for adverse possession, trespass, and to\n\nquiet title, and sought a declaratory judgment. In the complaint, he asserted he\n\nwas disabled and suffered from unspecified \"medical ailments.\" He stated his\n\nvolunteer caregiver had assisted him in the proceedings before the Board in 2011\n\nand 2019, and in filing the complaint.\n\n        In October 2019, the case was transferred to the Chancery Division. It\n\nwas referred to mediation in March 2020 but the parties were unable to reach a\n\nsettlement. A trial date was scheduled for September 9, 2020, but the trial did\n\nnot take place.1 In January 2021, the court issued a case management order\n\nsetting various deadlines and technical specifications in anticipation of a vi rtual\n\ntrial set for March 25, 2021.\n\n        Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment and filed a pretrial\n\nmemorandum.         Plaintiff retained counsel who requested a thirty-day\n\nadjournment of the trial date. The trial was adjourned to April 27, 2021.\n\n        On March 23, 2021, plaintiff sought leave to file an amended complaint\n\nseeking (1) an injunction of defendants' variances, and (2) the removal of\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The record does not reflect why the trial was not convened.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         3\n\fdefendants' fence from plaintiff's property. Defendants opposed the motion and\n\nplaintiff filed opposition to defendants' summary judgment application.\n\n        In early April, plaintiff's counsel requested an adjournment of the April\n\n20, 2021 pretrial conference because of a family vacation. He also requested\n\nthe court adjourn the trial date to May 4, 2021.\n\n        In an April 21, 2021 letter, plaintiff's counsel advised the court that\n\nplaintiff \"is not well and is in need of psychiatric treatment.\" Counsel further\n\nstated that plaintiff \"will be seen by a doctor soon and a proper letter from this\n\ndoctor will be submitted to the court upon receipt.\"\n\n        On May 14, 2021, the court: (1) granted defendants' partial summary\n\njudgment, dismissing the adverse possession claim; and (2) denied plaintiff's\n\nmotion to file an amended complaint.\n\n        On June 10, 2021, the court sua sponte entered an order of dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice for failure to prosecute. The order stated: \"Unless a [v]erified\n\n[c]omplaint for [g]uardianship of [p]laintiff is filed within [thirty] days,\n\ndismissal shall convert to a dismissal with prejudice of the above action.\"\n\n        On July 8, 2021 2, plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the court seeking\n\nreinstatement of the case on the trial calendar. Counsel explained that plaintiff\n\n\n2\n    The letter is mistakenly dated June 8, 2021.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         4\n\f\"has been under the care of a psychiatrist which was the basis for the dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice.\"      However, \"[u]nder further evaluation, [the] doctor\n\ndetermined [plaintiff] is deemed to be competent to stand trial on his own\n\nbehalf.\" Counsel promised to send \"corroboration\" of the psychiatrist's finding\n\nonce the doctor returned from vacation at the end of July and requested the court\n\n\"kindly reinstate this case on the trial calendar.\"\n\n      Defendants responded in a letter, opposing reinstatement of the litigation,\n\nand citing plaintiff's \"pattern\" of delaying the trial. Defendants urged the court\n\nto enforce its \"specific\" order and permanently dismiss the complaint.\n\n      In reply, plaintiff's counsel advised the court that plaintiff had acted in\n\ngood faith and in accordance with the recommendations of his treating doctor.\n\nCounsel stated the doctor found plaintiff could participate in a trial with the\n\nassistance of counsel and did not need \"a guardian for his day[-]to[-]day\n\nactivities at this time.\" Counsel also reminded the court that defendants had also\n\nrequested adjournments at the commencement of the litigation \"in an effort to\n\nstall same while they were completing the construction of their home.\" He\n\nrequested that \"the matter proceed to trial at the court's earliest convenience .\"\n\n      On August 6, 2021, plaintiff moved to vacate the dismissal order and to\n\nreinstate his complaint.     In support of the motion, plaintiff submitted a\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                         5\n\fcertification from counsel, attached to which was a physician's note indicating\n\nthat plaintiff had \"the capacity to understand, listen and digest information and\n\nto act in a logical and rational way on such information.\"3\n\n      By order and written statement of reasons dated January 19, 2022, the\n\ncourt denied plaintiff's motion to vacate the order of dismissal. The court found\n\nplaintiff had not complied with the terms of the June 10, 2021 order that required\n\nhim to file a guardianship complaint, and defendants had been \"significantly\n\nprejudiced\" by plaintiff's \"inexcusable delays.\"\n\n      The court explained:\n\n            Trial has been delayed or adjourned due to plaintiff's\n            inability to proceed since September 2020. The court\n            has had the opportunity to interact with plaintiff and\n            witness his demeanor, resulting in the directive to his\n            attorney that a [c]omplaint for [g]uardianship be filed\n            on his behalf. Without a [g]uardianship [c]omplaint,\n            the court cannot properly ascertain whether plaintiff\n            has the ability to act in his best interest, even if\n            represented by counsel.\n\n                  Plaintiff's continued delays have considerably\n            prejudiced defendants in this matter.        Though\n            defendant[s] ha[ve] not attached a schedule of\n            attorney's fees, [they] ha[ve] objected to multiple\n\n\n3\n  The appellate record does not include this certification or the physician's note.\nWe have derived this information from the trial court's January 19, 2022\nstatement of reasons issued with the order denying plaintiff's motion to vacate\nthe dismissal order.\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                        6\n\f            delays in this matter, citing prejudice to defendant[s]\n            based on \"increased legal fees.\" . . . .\n\n                  Plaintiff did not file any compliant motion\n            pursuant to the June 10, 2021, [o]rder, and, despite\n            notice, filed no motion until after his case was\n            dismissed with prejudice.

Importantly, because defendants did not file a motion for\n\ndismissal, plaintiff was deprived an opportunity to present opposition. Instead,\n\nthe court sua sponte dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to prosecute\n\nand required plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint to avoid dismissal with\n\nprejudice. There is no authority for that process.\n\n      Rule 1:13-7 addresses the dismissal of civil cases for lack of prosecution;\n\nRule 1:13-7(a) sets forth the procedure for a dismissal:\n\n            [E]xcept as otherwise provided by rule or court order,\n            whenever an action has been pending for four months\n            or, if a general equity action, for two months, without a\n            required proceeding having been taken therein as\n            hereinafter defined in subsection (b), the court shall\n            issue written notice to the plaintiff advising that the\n            action as to any or all defendants will be dismissed\n            without prejudice 60 days following the date of the\n            notice or 30 days thereafter in general equity cases\n            unless, within said period, action specified in\n            subsection (c) is taken. If no such action is taken, the\n            court shall enter an order of dismissal without prejudice\n            as to any named defendant and shall furnish the plaintiff\n            with a copy thereof.\n\n            [(emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2423-21\n                                        8\n\f      An action can only be dismissed by the court on its own order if a party\n\nhas failed to complete a required proceeding as defined under Rule 1:13-7(b):\n\nfailure to file (1) a proof or acknowledgement of service; (2) an answer; or (3)\n\nan entry of default or default judgment. Plaintiff was not deficient regarding\n\nany of those proceedings. In addition, the court did not issue written notice to\n\nplaintiff that it intended to dismiss the case without prejudice within thirty days\n\nif plaintiff did not comply with Rule 1:13-7(c).\n\n      Moreover, the court created its own required proceeding or required\n\naction, that is, a guardianship complaint, in order for plaintiff to avoid dismissal\n\nwith prejudice. However, the Rule does not include that action as a premise for\n\na court-initiated dismissal.\n\n      Guardianship proceedings are addressed in N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24 to -29 and\n\nRule 4:86-1 to -8. To appoint a guardian, a court must find that a person is\n\nincapacitated, N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24.1, with an \"[i]ncapacitated individual\" defined\n\nas \"an individual who is impaired by reason of mental illness or intellectual\n\ndisability to the extent that the individual lacks sufficient capacity to govern\n\nhimself and manage his affairs.\" N.J.S.A. 3B:1-2.\n\n      The record does not support the need for a guardianship proceeding. The\n\nonly reference to any issue relating to plaintiff's competence was in his counsel's\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         9\n\fApril 21, 2021 letter to the court indicating that plaintiff was \"not well\" and\n\nneeded \"psychiatric treatment.\" That is not sufficient to establish that plaintiff\n\nwas an \"incapacitated individual.\" And the court's June 2021 order does not\n\ninclude any reasons for its directive to plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint\n\nor face a permanent dismissal of his action.\n\n      There may have been discussions between counsel and perhaps with the\n\ncourt about plaintiff's competency.       But there is no record of any such\n\nconversations. We are supplied only with the correspondence as outlined above\n\nand the court's brief reference in its January 2022 order that it ordered the filing\n\nof a guardianship complaint following an \"interaction\" with plaintiff and\n\nobserving his demeanor.\n\n      But even accepting plaintiff's counsel raised a flag regarding plaintiff's\n\nmental health, the record does not support an order compelling a guardianship\n\ncomplaint. To the contrary, the record reflects plaintiff was examined by a\n\npsychiatrist and within several weeks counsel informed the court and defense\n\ncounsel that the psychiatrist deemed plaintiff competent and able to participate\n\nin a trial. Furthermore, plaintiff presented the court with documentation from\n\nhis doctor supporting his competency assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                        10\n\f      Under Rule 1:13-7(a), a plaintiff may move to vacate a dismissal order\n\nand reinstate its complaint. \"The motion shall be granted on good cause shown\n\nif filed within 90 days of the order of dismissal, and thereafter shall be granted\n\nonly on a showing of exceptional circumstances.\" R. 1:13-7(a).\n\n      Plaintiff filed the motion to vacate within ninety days of the June 2021\n\norder. Moreover, plaintiff established \"good cause\" warranting reinstatement of\n\nthe complaint. The June 2021 order was noncompliant with the court rules, and\n\nplaintiff's counsel's submissions attested to plaintiff's mental competence and\n\nthe lack of any need for a guardianship proceeding, as well as his ability to go\n\nto trial \"at the court's earliest convenience.\" As we have previously stated:\n\n                   \"Good cause\" is an amorphous term, that is, it \"is\n            difficult of precise delineation. Its application requires\n            the exercise of sound discretion in light of the facts and\n            circumstances of the particular case considered in the\n            context of the purposes of the [c]ourt [r]ule being\n            applied.\" Del[.] Valley Wholesale Florist, Inc. v.\n            Addalia, 349 [N.J.

Accordingly, the right to\n            \"reinstatement is ordinarily routinely and freely granted\n            when [the] plaintiff has cured the problem that led to\n            the dismissal even if the application is made many\n            months later.\" Rivera v.

Therefore, the\n\ncourt erred in denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the June 2021 order and\n\nreinstate the complaint. Moreover, the court did not find, and defendants did\n\nnot establish, any prejudice other than a reference to legal fees. And that is an\n\nissue that can be addressed, if appropriate, at the conclusion of the matter.

Schneider, attorney for respondents.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n          Plaintiff appeals from the January 19, 2022 order denying his motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint which was dismissed without prejudice in June 2021.\n\fThe June 2021 order was issued sua sponte and stated if plaintiff did not file a\n\ncomplaint for guardianship, the dismissal would convert to a dismissal with\n\nprejudice. We conclude the court should have granted plaintiff&#x27;s motion to\n\nreinstate his complaint. Therefore, we reverse and remand for the trial court to\n\nset a preemptory trial date.\n\n         The parties are neighbors and have a longstanding dispute regarding their\n\nproperty line. After defendants installed a fence in 2006 or 2007, plaintiff asked\n\nthem to remove it, claiming the fence was on his property. Defendants did not\n\ndo so.\n\n         In 2011, defendants sought permission from the East Hanover Land Use\n\nBoard (Board) to construct a two-story addition on their home. Their application\n\nincluded requests for certain variances. Plaintiff objected to the application,\n\nraising the property line dispute. Defendants withdrew the application.\n\n         In April 2019, defendants applied to the Board for permission to construct\n\na one-story addition on their house, with variances for setbacks and location of\n\na garage. Plaintiff again objected to the application, reiterating the continued\n\ndispute regarding the property line, and asserting a discrepancy between the\n\nparties&#x27; surveys. The Board approved defendants&#x27; application with amendments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                          2\n\f        Thereafter, the self-represented plaintiff filed a complaint against\n\ndefendants asserting causes of action for adverse possession, trespass, and to\n\nquiet title, and sought a declaratory judgment. In the complaint, he asserted he\n\nwas disabled and suffered from unspecified &quot;medical ailments.&quot; He stated his\n\nvolunteer caregiver had assisted him in the proceedings before the Board in 2011\n\nand 2019, and in filing the complaint.\n\n        In October 2019, the case was transferred to the Chancery Division. It\n\nwas referred to mediation in March 2020 but the parties were unable to reach a\n\nsettlement. A trial date was scheduled for September 9, 2020, but the trial did\n\nnot take place.1 In January 2021, the court issued a case management order\n\nsetting various deadlines and technical specifications in anticipation of a vi rtual\n\ntrial set for March 25, 2021.\n\n        Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment and filed a pretrial\n\nmemorandum.         Plaintiff retained counsel who requested a thirty-day\n\nadjournment of the trial date. The trial was adjourned to April 27, 2021.\n\n        On March 23, 2021, plaintiff sought leave to file an amended complaint\n\nseeking (1) an injunction of defendants&#x27; variances, and (2) the removal of\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The record does not reflect why the trial was not convened.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         3\n\fdefendants&#x27; fence from plaintiff&#x27;s property. Defendants opposed the motion and\n\nplaintiff filed opposition to defendants&#x27; summary judgment application.\n\n        In early April, plaintiff&#x27;s counsel requested an adjournment of the April\n\n20, 2021 pretrial conference because of a family vacation. He also requested\n\nthe court adjourn the trial date to May 4, 2021.\n\n        In an April 21, 2021 letter, plaintiff&#x27;s counsel advised the court that\n\nplaintiff &quot;is not well and is in need of psychiatric treatment.&quot; Counsel further\n\nstated that plaintiff &quot;will be seen by a doctor soon and a proper letter from this\n\ndoctor will be submitted to the court upon receipt.&quot;\n\n        On May 14, 2021, the court: (1) granted defendants&#x27; partial summary\n\njudgment, dismissing the adverse possession claim; and (2) denied plaintiff&#x27;s\n\nmotion to file an amended complaint.\n\n        On June 10, 2021, the court sua sponte entered an order of dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice for failure to prosecute. The order stated: &quot;Unless a [v]erified\n\n[c]omplaint for [g]uardianship of [p]laintiff is filed within [thirty] days,\n\ndismissal shall convert to a dismissal with prejudice of the above action.&quot;\n\n        On July 8, 2021 2, plaintiff&#x27;s counsel sent a letter to the court seeking\n\nreinstatement of the case on the trial calendar. Counsel explained that plaintiff\n\n\n2\n    The letter is mistakenly dated June 8, 2021.\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         4\n\f&quot;has been under the care of a psychiatrist which was the basis for the dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice.&quot;      However, &quot;[u]nder further evaluation, [the] doctor\n\ndetermined [plaintiff] is deemed to be competent to stand trial on his own\n\nbehalf.&quot; Counsel promised to send &quot;corroboration&quot; of the psychiatrist&#x27;s finding\n\nonce the doctor returned from vacation at the end of July and requested the court\n\n&quot;kindly reinstate this case on the trial calendar.&quot;\n\n      Defendants responded in a letter, opposing reinstatement of the litigation,\n\nand citing plaintiff&#x27;s &quot;pattern&quot; of delaying the trial. Defendants urged the court\n\nto enforce its &quot;specific&quot; order and permanently dismiss the complaint.\n\n      In reply, plaintiff&#x27;s counsel advised the court that plaintiff had acted in\n\ngood faith and in accordance with the recommendations of his treating doctor.\n\nCounsel stated the doctor found plaintiff could participate in a trial with the\n\nassistance of counsel and did not need &quot;a guardian for his day[-]to[-]day\n\nactivities at this time.&quot; Counsel also reminded the court that defendants had also\n\nrequested adjournments at the commencement of the litigation &quot;in an effort to\n\nstall same while they were completing the construction of their home.&quot; He\n\nrequested that &quot;the matter proceed to trial at the court&#x27;s earliest convenience .&quot;\n\n      On August 6, 2021, plaintiff moved to vacate the dismissal order and to\n\nreinstate his complaint.     In support of the motion, plaintiff submitted a\n\n\n                                                                             A-2423-21\n                                         5\n\fcertification from counsel, attached to which was a physician&#x27;s note indicating\n\nthat plaintiff had &quot;the capacity to understand, listen and digest information and\n\nto act in a logical and rational way on such information.&quot;3\n\n      By order and written statement of reasons dated January 19, 2022, the\n\ncourt denied plaintiff&#x27;s motion to vacate the order of dismissal. The court found\n\nplaintiff had not complied with the terms of the June 10, 2021 order that required\n\nhim to file a guardianship complaint, and defendants had been &quot;significantly\n\nprejudiced&quot; by plaintiff&#x27;s &quot;inexcusable delays.&quot;\n\n      The court explained:\n\n            Trial has been delayed or adjourned due to plaintiff&#x27;s\n            inability to proceed since September 2020. The court\n            has had the opportunity to interact with plaintiff and\n            witness his demeanor, resulting in the directive to his\n            attorney that a [c]omplaint for [g]uardianship be filed\n            on his behalf. Without a [g]uardianship [c]omplaint,\n            the court cannot properly ascertain whether plaintiff\n            has the ability to act in his best interest, even if\n            represented by counsel.\n\n                  Plaintiff&#x27;s continued delays have considerably\n            prejudiced defendants in this matter.

Instead,\n\nthe court sua sponte dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to prosecute\n\nand required plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint to avoid dismissal with\n\nprejudice. There is no authority for that process.\n\n      Rule 1:13-7 addresses the dismissal of civil cases for lack of prosecution;\n\nRule 1:13-7(a) sets forth the procedure for a dismissal:\n\n            [E]xcept as otherwise provided by rule or court order,\n            whenever an action has been pending for four months\n            or, if a general equity action, for two months, without a\n            required proceeding having been taken therein as\n            hereinafter defined in subsection (b), the court shall\n            issue written notice to the plaintiff advising that the\n            action as to any or all defendants will be dismissed\n            without prejudice 60 days following the date of the\n            notice or 30 days thereafter in general equity cases\n            unless, within said period, action specified in\n            subsection (c) is taken. If no such action is taken, the\n            court shall enter an order of dismissal without prejudice\n            as to any named defendant and shall furnish the plaintiff\n            with a copy thereof.\n\n            [(emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2423-21\n                                        8\n\f      An action can only be dismissed by the court on its own order if a party\n\nhas failed to complete a required proceeding as defined under Rule 1:13-7(b):\n\nfailure to file (1) a proof or acknowledgement of service; (2) an answer; or (3)\n\nan entry of default or default judgment. Plaintiff was not deficient regarding\n\nany of those proceedings. In addition, the court did not issue written notice to\n\nplaintiff that it intended to dismiss the case without prejudice within thirty days\n\nif plaintiff did not comply with Rule 1:13-7(c).\n\n      Moreover, the court created its own required proceeding or required\n\naction, that is, a guardianship complaint, in order for plaintiff to avoid dismissal\n\nwith prejudice. However, the Rule does not include that action as a premise for\n\na court-initiated dismissal.\n\n      Guardianship proceedings are addressed in N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24 to -29 and\n\nRule 4:86-1 to -8. To appoint a guardian, a court must find that a person is\n\nincapacitated, N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24.1, with an &quot;[i]ncapacitated individual&quot; defined\n\nas &quot;an individual who is impaired by reason of mental illness or intellectual\n\ndisability to the extent that the individual lacks sufficient capacity to govern\n\nhimself and manage his affairs.&quot; N.J.S.A. 3B:1-2.\n\n      The record does not support the need for a guardianship proceeding. The\n\nonly reference to any issue relating to plaintiff&#x27;s competence was in his counsel&#x27;s\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                         9\n\fApril 21, 2021 letter to the court indicating that plaintiff was &quot;not well&quot; and\n\nneeded &quot;psychiatric treatment.&quot; That is not sufficient to establish that plaintiff\n\nwas an &quot;incapacitated individual.&quot; And the court&#x27;s June 2021 order does not\n\ninclude any reasons for its directive to plaintiff to file a guardianship complaint\n\nor face a permanent dismissal of his action.\n\n      There may have been discussions between counsel and perhaps with the\n\ncourt about plaintiff&#x27;s competency.       But there is no record of any such\n\nconversations. We are supplied only with the correspondence as outlined above\n\nand the court&#x27;s brief reference in its January 2022 order that it ordered the filing\n\nof a guardianship complaint following an &quot;interaction&quot; with plaintiff and\n\nobserving his demeanor.\n\n      But even accepting plaintiff&#x27;s counsel raised a flag regarding plaintiff&#x27;s\n\nmental health, the record does not support an order compelling a guardianship\n\ncomplaint. To the contrary, the record reflects plaintiff was examined by a\n\npsychiatrist and within several weeks counsel informed the court and defense\n\ncounsel that the psychiatrist deemed plaintiff competent and able to participate\n\nin a trial. Furthermore, plaintiff presented the court with documentation from\n\nhis doctor supporting his competency assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-2423-21\n                                        10\n\f      Under Rule 1:13-7(a), a plaintiff may move to vacate a dismissal order\n\nand reinstate its complaint. &quot;The motion shall be granted on good cause shown\n\nif filed within 90 days of the order of dismissal, and thereafter shall be granted\n\nonly on a showing of exceptional circumstances.&quot; R. 1:13-7(a).\n\n      Plaintiff filed the motion to vacate within ninety days of the June 2021\n\norder. Moreover, plaintiff established &quot;good cause&quot; warranting reinstatement of\n\nthe complaint. The June 2021 order was noncompliant with the court rules, and\n\nplaintiff&#x27;s counsel&#x27;s submissions attested to plaintiff&#x27;s mental competence and\n\nthe lack of any need for a guardianship proceeding, as well as his ability to go\n\nto trial &quot;at the court&#x27;s earliest convenience.&quot; As we have previously stated:\n\n                   &quot;Good cause&quot; is an amorphous term, that is, it &quot;is\n            difficult of precise delineation. Its application requires\n            the exercise of sound discretion in light of the facts and\n            circumstances of the particular case considered in the\n            context of the purposes of the [c]ourt [r]ule being\n            applied.&quot; Del[.] Valley Wholesale Florist, Inc. v.\n            Addalia, 349 [N.J.

Accordingly, the right to\n            &quot;reinstatement is ordinarily routinely and freely granted\n            when [the] plaintiff has cured the problem that led to\n            the dismissal even if the application is made many\n            months later.&quot; Rivera v.

Therefore, the\n\ncourt erred in denying plaintiff&#x27;s motion to vacate the June 2021 order and\n\nreinstate the complaint. Moreover, the court did not find, and defendants did\n\nnot establish, any prejudice other than a reference to legal fees. And that is an\n\nissue that can be addressed, if appropriate, at the conclusion of the matter.

He argues the\n\nPCR court erred by rejecting his claim that trial counsel was ineffective by\n\nfailing to argue defendant's relative age\u2014twenty-three when he committed the\n\noffenses to which he pleaded guilty\u2014and difficult upbringing should have been\n\nconsidered by the trial court in mitigation of his sentence. Unpersuaded by\n\ndefendant's arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      A grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with second-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit kidnapping, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:13-\n\n1(b)(1);   first-degree   kidnapping,   N.J.S.A.   2C:13-1(b)(1);   first-degree\n\nconspiracy to commit murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and\n\n(2); first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2); first-degree felony\n\nmurder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(3); second-degree unlawful possession of a\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                        2\n\fhandgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b); and second-degree possession of a weapon for\n\nan unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a).\n\n      Defendant later pleaded guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement\n\nwith the State. Under the agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to an amended\n\ncharge of first-degree aggravated manslaughter, first-degree kidnapping, first-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit murder, and second-degree unlawful possession of\n\na handgun. The State agreed to recommend dismissal of the remaining charges\n\nand that the court impose an aggregate sentence not to exceed twenty-years\n\nsubject to the requirements of the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:43-7.2.\n\n      At the plea proceeding, defendant testified that he and three of his co-\n\ndefendants traveled by car from Newark to Jersey City and kidnapped the victim\n\nby forcibly placing her in the trunk of their vehicle for the purpose of\n\ntransporting her to Newark where she would be \"badly hurt or killed.\" After\n\ndefendant and his cohorts transported the victim to Newark, she was taken out\n\nof the trunk and brought into an abandoned house by one of the co-defendants\n\nfor the purpose of \"shoot[ing] her dead.\" Defendant testified he knew one of the\n\nco-defendants had a gun and was going \"to shoot [the victim] dead.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                       3\n\f      Defendant admitted he stood outside the house as a \"lookout\" \"to make\n\nsure that no police or anyone else came by while\" the co-defendant was in the\n\nhouse with the victim. Defendant testified his participation in the kidnapping\n\nand murder was \"all part of an agreement [he] had made\" with the co-defendants.\n\nDefendant admitted he had the ability to exercise control over the handgun the\n\nco-defendant used to shoot the victim and that he exercised constructive\n\npossession of the handgun. Defendant also testified that as he stood outside the\n\nhouse, he heard gunshots from within it.\n\n      The court accepted defendant's plea and later sentenced defendant in\n\naccordance with the plea agreement. At sentencing, the court noted defendant\n\nwas then twenty-eight years old, of good mental health, and had admitted to\n\nprior drug use. The court noted defendant's membership in the Pirus sect of the\n\nBloods gang, his two adjudications and one deferred disposition as a juvenile,\n\nand his seventeen disorderly persons convictions as an adult.\n\n      The sentencing court found aggravating factors: three, the risk defendant\n\nwill commit another offense, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3); five, there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood defendant is involved in organized criminal activity, N.J.S.A. 2C:44 -\n\n1(a)(5); six, the extent of defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness\n\nof the offenses for which he had been convicted, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(6); and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                       4\n\fnine, the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:44-1(a)(9). The court did not list any mitigating factors on the judgment of\n\nconviction.\n\n      The court imposed an aggregate sentence of twenty years subject to the\n\nrequirements of NERA.1 We affirmed defendant's aggregate sentence on his\n\ndirect appeal, State v. Adams, No. A-3302-17 (App. Div. Dec. 3, 2018), but\n\nremanded for entry of an amended judgment of conviction merging defendant's\n\nconviction for conspiracy to commit murder with his conviction on the amended\n\ncharge of aggravated manslaughter.\n\n      The court later entered an amended judgment of conviction reflecting the\n\nmerger, but it did not alter or modify defendant's aggregate twenty-year\n\nsentence. The Supreme Court denied defendant's petition for certification from\n\nour affirmance of his sentence. State v. Adams, 238 N.J. 43 (2019).\n\n      Defendant filed a timely pro se PCR petition, claiming the trial court erred\n\nby failing to consider \"mitigating factors during sentencing\" and trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective by failing to \"argue these mitigating factors.\"        In a brief\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The court imposed concurrent twenty-year sentences on the first-degree\nkidnapping, conspiracy to commit murder, and aggravated manslaughter\noffenses.\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        5\n\fsubmitted by his PCR counsel, defendant made the following arguments in\n\nsupport of his petition:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE TRIAL COURT\n            WAS IMPROPER, ILLEGAL, OR OTHERWISE\n            UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n\n            POINT II\n\n            DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE   OF   TRIAL   COUNSEL    IN\n            VIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES AND NEW\n            JERSEY CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n            POINT III\n\n            THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ERRORS\n            COMPLAINED OF RENDERED THE TRIAL\n            UNFAIR.\n\n            POINT IV\n\n            DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF APPELLATE COUNSEL.\n\n            POINT V\n\n            AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS REQUIRED WITH\n            REGARD    TO   THE    ALLEGATIONS    OF\n            DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR [PCR].\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  A-0227-22\n                                  6\n\f            POINT VI\n\n            [] DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR [PCR] SHOULD\n            NOT    BE  BARRED    BY    PROCEDURAL\n            CONSIDERATION[].\n\n      Following argument on the petition, the court issued an opinion from the\n\nbench.   The court explained that the kidnapping was captured on a video\n\nrecording. The sentencing court described the video in detail, explaining it\n\nshowed the victim was \"taken from in front of her friend's house in Jersey City,\n\nmanhandled across the sidewalk at gunpoint, stuck in the trunk of a car at\n\ngunpoint, [and] hit over the head as she entered it.\" The sentencing court further\n\nnoted the video showed defendant \"fetch[] the gun\" that a co-defendant placed\n\nto the victim's head during the kidnapping, and that after the victim was placed\n\nin the trunk of the car and driven to Newark, she was \"executed\"\u2014\"shot five\n\ntimes\"\u2014\"as discipline for her violation of gang rules.\" The sentencing court\n\nfurther detailed defendant's testimony during the plea proceeding describing his\n\nparticipation in the kidnapping and execution.\n\n      The PCR court, which also presided over defendant's sentencing,\n\nexplained that it had considered mitigating factor twelve, the willingness of\n\ndefendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-\n\n1(b)(12) at sentencing, but did not list it on defendant's judgment of conviction\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        7\n\fbased on a concern it would have \"adverse collateral consequences\" for him\n\nwhile incarcerated.2 The court further noted it had considered the non-statutory\n\nmitigating factor of defendant's age at the time it imposed sentence, but\n\nacknowledged the \"factor was not mentioned\" and it \"did not make a specific\n\nruling\" as to the factor.\n\n      The court further explained that had defendant's trial counsel argued the\n\nnon-statutory factor of defendant's relative youth at sentencing, it would have\n\nrejected the contention due to defendant's juvenile record, the numerous\n\ndisorderly persons convictions defendant had as an adult, and defendant's \"gang\n\naffiliation . . . which was intimately affiliated with the motive for the crime[s]\"\n\nfor which he was sentenced. The court further noted it was aware of \"the\n\ncognitive science about the . . . development of the [human] brain,\" but that\n\ndefendant's crimes were \"not . . . act[s] of an impetuous . . . youthful folly\" and\n\ninstead constituted \"an orchestrated kidnapping and execution.\"\n\n      The PCR court also noted appellate counsel on defendant's direct appeal\n\nargued the sentencing court \"didn't properly account for\" defendant's youth. The\n\nPCR court further explained we had rejected defendant's argument, affirmed his\n\n\n\n2\n The PCR court explained that it would amend the JOC to reflect its finding of\nmitigating factor twelve in its prior determination of defendant's sentence.\n                                                                             A-0227-22\n                                        8\n\fsentence, and concluded \"the sentence was not manifestly excessive or unduly\n\npunitive and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\"\n\n      The PCR court concluded defendant's argument trial counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to argue at sentencing that the court should find the non-\n\nstatutory mitigating factor of defendant's relative youth was barred under Rule\n\n3:22-5. The Rule provides that \"[a] prior adjudication upon the merits of any\n\nground for relief\" in a PCR petition \"is conclusive whether made in the\n\nproceedings resulting in the conviction or in any post-conviction proceeding\n\nbrought pursuant to [Rule 3:22] or prior to the adoption thereof, or in any appeal\n\ntaken from such proceedings.\"        R. 3:22-5.    The PCR court determined\n\ndefendant's claim the court erred by failing to consider his relative youth at\n\nsentencing had been addressed and rejected by this court on defendant's direct\n\nappeal and, therefore, the claim could not properly support a PCR petition under\n\nRule 3:22-5.\n\n      The PCR court also considered the merits of defendant's argument that his\n\nsentence was illegal because the trial court had purportedly failed to properly\n\nfind and weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. The court rejected the\n\ncontention, finding a court's failure to correctly find and weigh the statutory\n\nfactors in its imposition of sentence does not result in an illegal sentence. See\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        9\n\fState v. Acevedo, 205 N.J. 40, 47 (2011) (explaining an \"allegation[] of\n\nimproper consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors\" does not support\n\na cognizable illegal-sentence claim in a PCR petition).\n\n      The PCR court also addressed defendant's claim trial counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to argue at sentencing the court should find the non -\n\nstatutory mitigating factor of defendant's relative youth. The court analyzed the\n\nclaim under the two-pronged standard established in Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984), and adopted as applicable under the New Jersey\n\nConstitution by our Supreme Court in State v. Fritz, 105 N.J. 42, 58 (1987), for\n\nassessing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court determined\n\ndefendant failed to sustain his burden under the standard and rejected the claim.\n\n      The court entered an order denying defendant's PCR petition without an\n\nevidentiary hearing. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, defendant presents the following arguments:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY\n            HEARING AS HE ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE\n            CASE THAT SENTENCING COUNSEL'S FAILURE\n            TO ADDRESS DEFENDANT'S RELATIVE YOUTH\n            AT THE TIME HE COMMITTED THE INSTANT\n            OFFENSES AS A NON-STATUTORY MITIGATING\n            FACTOR      CONSTITUTES      INEFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF SENTENCING COUNSEL.\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      10\n\f            POINT II\n\n            DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR [PCR] SHOULD\n            NOT   BE   BARRED    BY   PROCEDURAL\n            CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n                                       II.\n\n      We review the legal conclusions of a PCR court de novo. State v. Harris,\n\n181 N.J. 391, 419 (2004). The de novo standard of review also applies to mixed\n\nquestions of fact and law. Id. at 420. Where an evidentiary hearing has not been\n\nheld, it is within our authority \"to conduct a de novo review of both the factual\n\nfindings and legal conclusions of the PCR court.\" Id. at 421 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). We apply these standards here.\n\n      The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\nParagraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution guarantee that a defendant in a\n\ncriminal proceeding has the right to the assistance of counsel in his or her\n\ndefense. The right to counsel includes \"the right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\" State v. Nash, 212 N.J. 518, 541 (2013) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 686).\n\n      In Strickland, the Court established a two-part test as the standard to\n\ndetermine whether a defendant has been deprived of the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; see also Fritz, 105 N.J. at 58. Under the\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      11\n\ffirst prong of the Strickland standard, a petitioner must show counsel's\n\nperformance was deficient.     Ibid. A petitioner must demonstrate counsel's\n\nhandling of the matter \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and\n\n\"counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel'\n\nguaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" Id. at 687-88. Under the\n\nstandard's second prong, a defendant must \"affirmatively prove\" \"a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\" State v. Gideon, 244 N.J. 538, 551\n\n(2021) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\n\n      \"With respect to both prongs of the Strickland test, a defendant asserting\n\nineffective assistance of counsel on PCR bears the burden of proving his or her\n\nright to relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\" State v. Gaitan, 209 N.J.\n\n339, 350 (2012) (citing State v. Echols, 199 N.J. 344, 357 (2009); State v.\n\nGoodwin, 173 N.J. 583, 593 (2002)). A failure to satisfy either prong of the\n\nStrickland standard requires the denial of a PCR petition. Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 700; Nash, 212 N.J. at 542; Fritz, 105 N.J. at 52.\n\n      Defendant committed the crimes for which he was convicted when he was\n\ntwenty-three years old, and he was sentenced in 2014 when he was twenty-six.\n\nAt the time of sentencing, the Legislature had not yet enacted mitigating factor\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                       12\n\ffourteen, which requires that a sentencing court consider that a defendant was\n\nunder the age of twenty-six at the time of the commission of the offenses for\n\nwhich sentence shall be imposed. N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(14).3 Thus, there was\n\nno statutory mitigating factor based on defendant's relative youth that could have\n\nbeen properly argued by trial counsel at defendant's 2014 sentencing.\n\n      Prior to defendant's 2014 sentencing, the Supreme Court had explained\n\nthat a \"defendant's relative youth ordinarily would inure to his [or her] benefit\"\n\nin the determination of an appropriate sentence. State v. Dunbar, 108 N.J. 80,\n\n95 (1987); see also State v. Pindale, 249 N.J. Super. 266, 289 (App. Div. 1991)\n\n(explaining youth was \"not one of the delineated statutory mitigating\n\ncircumstances,\" but noting the sentencing court's failure to give \"consideration\n\nto [the] defendant's youth\"); State v. Tanksley, 245 N.J. Super. 390, 397 (App.\n\nDiv. 1991) (quoting Dunbar, 108 N.J. at 95) (remanding for resentencing a\n\nseventeen-year-old defendant on an aggravated manslaughter conviction and\n\nnoting the defendant's relative youth should \"inure to his benefit\" at\n\nresentencing). As such, when the court imposed defendant's sentence, there was\n\n\n3\n    In 2020, the legislature amended N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b) to add statutory\nmitigating factor fourteen\u2014\"[t]he defendant was under [twenty-six] years of age\nat the time of the commission of the offense.\" L. 2020, c. 110, \u00a7 1 (eff. Oct. 19,\n2020). In State v. Lane, 251 N.J. 84, 87 (2022), the Court held mitigating factor\nfourteen applies only to sentences imposed on or after the date of its enactment.\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                       13\n\fwell-established precedent supporting an argument that his relative youth should\n\n\"inure to his benefit\" in the sentencing calculus. Dunbar, 108 N.J. at 95; see\n\nalso State v. Rivera, 249 N.J. 285, 301 (2021) (summarizing precedent\n\nestablishing \"the importance of considering youth in making sentencing\n\ndecisions\").\n\n         Defendant correctly notes trial counsel did not argue at sentencing that\n\ndefendant's relative youth should be considered by the court in mitigation of his\n\nsentence. He claims trial counsel was ineffective by failing to urge the court to\n\nconsider his relative youth at sentencing and the PCR court erred by finding he\n\nhad not satisfied his burden under the Strickland standard based on counsel's\n\nerror.\n\n         \"Although a demonstration of prejudice constitutes the second part of the\n\nStrickland analysis, courts are permitted leeway to choose to examine first\n\nwhether a defendant has been prejudiced, and if not, to dismiss the claim without\n\ndetermining whether counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient .\"\n\nGaitan, 209 N.J. at 350 (citation omitted). Here, based on our review of the\n\nrecord, we are convinced the court correctly denied defendant's PCR petition\n\nbecause he did not satisfy the \"second, and far more difficult prong of the\"\n\nStrickland standard, Gideon, 244 N.J. at 550; that is, defendant failed to\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        14\n\faffirmatively demonstrate there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's\n\nalleged error, the result of his sentencing proceeding would have been different,\n\nid. at 550-51; see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n      As the PCR court\u2014which, as noted was also the sentencing court\u2014\n\nexplained, even if trial counsel had argued defendant's relative youth in\n\nmitigation of sentence, that non-statutory mitigating factor would not have\n\nchanged the sentence imposed.       The court explained that defendant's prior\n\njuvenile and adult criminal history, his participation in organized criminal\n\nactivity, the premediated kidnapping and execution of the victim, the need to\n\ndeter defendant and others from violating the law, and the risk defendant would\n\ncommit another offense so outweighed any reasonable reliance on defendant's\n\nrelative youth as a non-statutory mitigating factor that there is no probability\n\ndefendant's sentence would have been different if his counsel had argued his\n\nrelative youth should also be considered as a factor in sentencing.         More\n\nimportantly, however, defendant made and makes no affirmative showing that\n\nhad his counsel argued his relative youth in mitigation of his sentence, there is\n\na reasonable probability the outcome of his sentencing proceeding would have\n\nbeen different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Gideon, 244 N.J. at 550-51.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                       15\n\f      Additionally, the court was aware of defendant's age at the time he\n\ncommitted the very serious offenses for which he was convicted. The court\n\nnoted defendant's age\u2014twenty-six\u2014at the time of sentencing, knew that the\n\ncrimes were committed three years earlier, and therefore was fully aware of\n\ndefendant's age\u2014twenty-three\u2014when he committed the offenses.            And, on\n\ndefendant's direct appeal, we rejected defendant's claim the sentencing court\n\nerred by failing to consider his relative youth as a non-statutory mitigating\n\nfactor, concluding his sentence was not unfair, excessive, or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Stated differently, we determined that based on the other\n\ncircumstances presented by defendant at sentencing, the court's failure to\n\nconsider defendant's relative youth was of no moment.\n\n      Thus, on the record presented, defendant failed to sustain his burden of\n\ndemonstrating prejudice under Strickland's second prong and, for that reason\n\nalone, his PCR claim his counsel was ineffective at sentencing fails. Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 700; Gaitan, 209 N.J. at 350.\n\n      Because we are convinced defendant failed to sustain his burden under\n\nStrickland's second prong, it is unnecessary to address his claim trial counsel's\n\nperformance was deficient under Strickland's first prong by failing to argue\n\ndefendant's relative youth should be considered as a non-statutory mitigating\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                      16\n\ffactor at sentencing. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700 (explaining a failure to\n\nsatisfy either prong of the standard requires the denial of a PCR petition); Nash,\n\n212 N.J. at 543 (explaining a defendant must satisfy both prongs of the\n\nStrickland standard to obtain PCR on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).\n\nWe note only that in State v. Hess, the Court held that a failure to \"present\n\nmitigating evidence or argue for mitigating factors\" at sentencing constitutes\n\ndeficient performance under Strickland's first prong where \"the sentencing court\n\nwas deprived of information and arguments that might well have led it to impose\n\na lesser term,\" 207 N.J. 123, 154 (2011). For the reasons we have explained,\n\ndefendant has not made that showing here.\n\n      In sum, defendant failed to sustain his burden of establishing a prima facie\n\ncase of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Strickland standard.4 We\n\ntherefore affirm the court's order denying his PCR petition and find it\n\n\n\n4\n   Defendant challenges only the PCR court's determinations that he failed to\nsustain his burden of establishing a prima facie claim his trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance at sentencing and that the claim is also barred under Rule\n3:22-5. Defendant does not argue on appeal the PCR court erred by rejecting\nany of the other arguments he presented in support of his petition. We therefore\ndeem those arguments abandoned.

Stephens II, Acting Essex County\n            Prosecutor, attorney for respondent (Frank J. Ducoat,\n            Special Deputy Attorney General/Acting Assistant\n            Prosecutor, of counsel and on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      Defendant Karon Adams appeals from an order denying his post-\n\nconviction relief (PCR) petition without an evidentiary hearing. He argues the\n\nPCR court erred by rejecting his claim that trial counsel was ineffective by\n\nfailing to argue defendant&#x27;s relative age\u2014twenty-three when he committed the\n\noffenses to which he pleaded guilty\u2014and difficult upbringing should have been\n\nconsidered by the trial court in mitigation of his sentence. Unpersuaded by\n\ndefendant&#x27;s arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      A grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with second-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit kidnapping, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:13-\n\n1(b)(1);   first-degree   kidnapping,   N.J.S.A.   2C:13-1(b)(1);   first-degree\n\nconspiracy to commit murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and\n\n(2); first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2); first-degree felony\n\nmurder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(3); second-degree unlawful possession of a\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                        2\n\fhandgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b); and second-degree possession of a weapon for\n\nan unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a).\n\n      Defendant later pleaded guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement\n\nwith the State. Under the agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to an amended\n\ncharge of first-degree aggravated manslaughter, first-degree kidnapping, first-\n\ndegree conspiracy to commit murder, and second-degree unlawful possession of\n\na handgun. The State agreed to recommend dismissal of the remaining charges\n\nand that the court impose an aggregate sentence not to exceed twenty-years\n\nsubject to the requirements of the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:43-7.2.\n\n      At the plea proceeding, defendant testified that he and three of his co-\n\ndefendants traveled by car from Newark to Jersey City and kidnapped the victim\n\nby forcibly placing her in the trunk of their vehicle for the purpose of\n\ntransporting her to Newark where she would be &quot;badly hurt or killed.&quot; After\n\ndefendant and his cohorts transported the victim to Newark, she was taken out\n\nof the trunk and brought into an abandoned house by one of the co-defendants\n\nfor the purpose of &quot;shoot[ing] her dead.&quot; Defendant testified he knew one of the\n\nco-defendants had a gun and was going &quot;to shoot [the victim] dead.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-0227-22\n                                       3\n\f      Defendant admitted he stood outside the house as a &quot;lookout&quot; &quot;to make\n\nsure that no police or anyone else came by while&quot; the co-defendant was in the\n\nhouse with the victim. Defendant testified his participation in the kidnapping\n\nand murder was &quot;all part of an agreement [he] had made&quot; with the co-defendants.\n\nDefendant admitted he had the ability to exercise control over the handgun the\n\nco-defendant used to shoot the victim and that he exercised constructive\n\npossession of the handgun. Defendant also testified that as he stood outside the\n\nhouse, he heard gunshots from within it.\n\n      The court accepted defendant&#x27;s plea and later sentenced defendant in\n\naccordance with the plea agreement. At sentencing, the court noted defendant\n\nwas then twenty-eight years old, of good mental health, and had admitted to\n\nprior drug use. The court noted defendant&#x27;s membership in the Pirus sect of the\n\nBloods gang, his two adjudications and one deferred disposition as a juvenile,\n\nand his seventeen disorderly persons convictions as an adult.\n\n      The sentencing court found aggravating factors: three, the risk defendant\n\nwill commit another offense, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3); five, there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood defendant is involved in organized criminal activity, N.J.S.A. 2C:44 -\n\n1(a)(5); six, the extent of defendant&#x27;s prior criminal record and the seriousness\n\nof the offenses for which he had been convicted, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(6); and\n\n\n                                                                           A-0227-22\n                                       4\n\fnine, the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:44-1(a)(9). The court did not list any mitigating factors on the judgment of\n\nconviction.\n\n      The court imposed an aggregate sentence of twenty years subject to the\n\nrequirements of NERA.1 We affirmed defendant&#x27;s aggregate sentence on his\n\ndirect appeal, State v. Adams, No. A-3302-17 (App. Div. Dec. 3, 2018), but\n\nremanded for entry of an amended judgment of conviction merging defendant&#x27;s\n\nconviction for conspiracy to commit murder with his conviction on the amended\n\ncharge of aggravated manslaughter.\n\n      The court later entered an amended judgment of conviction reflecting the\n\nmerger, but it did not alter or modify defendant&#x27;s aggregate twenty-year\n\nsentence. The Supreme Court denied defendant&#x27;s petition for certification from\n\nour affirmance of his sentence. State v.

The court explained that the kidnapping was captured on a video\n\nrecording. The sentencing court described the video in detail, explaining it\n\nshowed the victim was &quot;taken from in front of her friend&#x27;s house in Jersey City,\n\nmanhandled across the sidewalk at gunpoint, stuck in the trunk of a car at\n\ngunpoint, [and] hit over the head as she entered it.&quot; The sentencing court further\n\nnoted the video showed defendant &quot;fetch[] the gun&quot; that a co-defendant placed\n\nto the victim&#x27;s head during the kidnapping, and that after the victim was placed\n\nin the trunk of the car and driven to Newark, she was &quot;executed&quot;\u2014&quot;shot five\n\ntimes&quot;\u2014&quot;as discipline for her violation of gang rules.&quot; The sentencing court\n\nfurther detailed defendant&#x27;s testimony during the plea proceeding describing his\n\nparticipation in the kidnapping and execution.\n\n      The PCR court, which also presided over defendant&#x27;s sentencing,\n\nexplained that it had considered mitigating factor twelve, the willingness of\n\ndefendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-\n\n1(b)(12) at sentencing, but did not list it on defendant&#x27;s judgment of conviction\n\n\n                                                                            A-0227-22\n                                        7\n\fbased on a concern it would have &quot;adverse collateral consequences&quot; for him\n\nwhile incarcerated.2 The court further noted it had considered the non-statutory\n\nmitigating factor of defendant&#x27;s age at the time it imposed sentence, but\n\nacknowledged the &quot;factor was not mentioned&quot; and it &quot;did not make a specific\n\nruling&quot; as to the factor.\n\n      The court further explained that had defendant&#x27;s trial counsel argued the\n\nnon-statutory factor of defendant&#x27;s relative youth at sentencing, it would have\n\nrejected the contention due to defendant&#x27;s juvenile record, the numerous\n\ndisorderly persons convictions defendant had as an adult, and defendant&#x27;s &quot;gang\n\naffiliation . . . which was intimately affiliated with the motive for the crime[s]&quot;\n\nfor which he was sentenced. The court further noted it was aware of &quot;the\n\ncognitive science about the . . . development of the [human] brain,&quot; but that\n\ndefendant&#x27;s crimes were &quot;not . . . act[s] of an impetuous . . . youthful folly&quot; and\n\ninstead constituted &quot;an orchestrated kidnapping and execution.&quot;\n\n      The PCR court also noted appellate counsel on defendant&#x27;s direct appeal\n\nargued the sentencing court &quot;didn&#x27;t properly account for&quot; defendant&#x27;s youth. The\n\nPCR court further explained we had rejected defendant&#x27;s argument, affirmed his\n\n\n\n2\n The PCR court explained that it would amend the JOC to reflect its finding of\nmitigating factor twelve in its prior determination of defendant&#x27;s sentence.\n                                                                             A-0227-22\n                                        8\n\fsentence, and concluded &quot;the sentence was not manifestly excessive or unduly\n\npunitive and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.&quot;\n\n      The PCR court concluded defendant&#x27;s argument trial counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to argue at sentencing that the court should find the non-\n\nstatutory mitigating factor of defendant&#x27;s relative youth was barred under Rule\n\n3:22-5. The Rule provides that &quot;[a] prior adjudication upon the merits of any\n\nground for relief&quot; in a PCR petition &quot;is conclusive whether made in the\n\nproceedings resulting in the conviction or in any post-conviction proceeding\n\nbrought pursuant to [Rule 3:22] or prior to the adoption thereof, or in any appeal\n\ntaken from such proceedings.&quot;        R. 3:22-5.    The PCR court determined\n\ndefendant&#x27;s claim the court erred by failing to consider his relative youth at\n\nsentencing had been addressed and rejected by this court on defendant&#x27;s direct\n\nappeal and, therefore, the claim could not properly support a PCR petition under\n\nRule 3:22-5.\n\n      The PCR court also considered the merits of defendant&#x27;s argument that his\n\nsentence was illegal because the trial court had purportedly failed to properly\n\nfind and weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. The court rejected the\n\ncontention, finding a court&#x27;s failure to correctly find and weigh the statutory\n\nfactors in its imposition of sentence does not result in an illegal sentence.

The court explained that defendant&#x27;s prior\n\njuvenile and adult criminal history, his participation in organized criminal\n\nactivity, the premediated kidnapping and execution of the victim, the need to\n\ndeter defendant and others from violating the law, and the risk defendant would\n\ncommit another offense so outweighed any reasonable reliance on defendant&#x27;s\n\nrelative youth as a non-statutory mitigating factor that there is no probability\n\ndefendant&#x27;s sentence would have been different if his counsel had argued his\n\nrelative youth should also be considered as a factor in sentencing.

Dukes, No. A-4668-17\n\n(App. Div. Mar. 26, 2021) (slip op. at 4).\n\n                  During the early morning hours of April 10,\n            2017, [the three victims] Rodriguez, Ramos-Sanchez,\n            and Paz left a nightclub and headed towards a\n            restaurant. A nearby surveillance camera captured\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                        2\n\fthem on film as they passed by shortly before the\nrobbery. At trial, Rodriguez identified the man, seen\nwearing a hat, walking behind the group almost\nimmediately after they went out of camera range, as the\nperson who punched him in the head from behind,\nknocking him to the ground. Paz screamed for help,\nsomehow fell, broke her ankle, and rolled beneath a\nparked car. Rodriguez attempted to get up to help her,\nbut [he] was struck again by the man with a hat, this\ntime with an object. That blow left a laceration on\nRodriguez's forehead requiring twelve stitches that left\na visible scar shown to the jury. The man with the hat\ndemanded Rodriguez's money and searched his\npockets.\n\n      ....\n\n      Paz's recollection was that as the group was\nwalking, someone demanded their money. She thought\nthe assailants were in front of the group but could not\nbe certain.\n\n      Ramos-Sanchez said she saw two men approach\nfrom the rear and heard them demand money; she was\nsprayed in the face with an irritant. She immediately\nran to an intersecting street, and the men chasing her\nturned away. Ramos-Sanchez encountered pedestrians\nleaving a bar, who called the police on her behalf. Her\neye remained cloudy after the incident, although she\nrefused medical attention at the time.\n\n      None of the victims, who had been drinking,\ncould identify their attackers. Rodriguez remembered\nonly that the man who struck him in the forehead wore\ndark clothes and a cap. He initially thought he was hit\nwith a gun, but over time became uncertain as to the\nnature of the object. Rodriguez and Ramos-Sanchez\n\n\n                                                           A-2227-22\n                           3\n\f           were sure there were only two assailants; Paz thought\n           there may have been three or four.\n\n                 New Brunswick Police Sergeant Theirry\n           Lemmerling obtained the surveillance videos, shown to\n           the jury, from two neighborhood stores.                He\n           downloaded them onto a flash drive, then transferring\n           them to a disc. During trial, all three victims identified\n           themselves on the video. The person walking closest to\n           the group as it leaves camera range was wearing a hat.\n           Lemmerling made still photographs from the video\n           footage of the two men walking behind the victims,\n           including the man with a hat. A few days later, two\n           New Brunswick police officers drove by defendant\n           standing at a corner. They had been shown the still\n           photograph that morning and knew there was an\n           outstanding warrant for his arrest related to the robbery.\n           The officers stopped, and when one of them told\n           defendant he had an arrest warrant, defendant fled. A\n           third officer saw defendant running, saw him discard\n           ten glassine envelopes containing heroin and fiorinal\n           fentanyl, and caught him. When arrested, defendant\n           was carrying a can of pepper spray.\n\n                 At the station, New Brunswick Police\n           Department Detective Brandt Gregus questioned\n           defendant and showed him the still photo. Defendant\n           admitted he was the man wearing a hat walking a few\n           paces behind the three victims[,] moments before the\n           robbery. That picture was admitted into evidence and\n           shown to the jury when Gregus testified.\n\n     Defendant was indicted by a grand jury, and charged, along with a co-\n\ndefendant, Ricky Greene, with: three counts of first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:15-1; second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(a) and\n\n\n                                                                        A-2227-22\n                                       4\n\f2C:15-1; and two counts of second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-\n\n1b(1). Defendant alone was also charged with third-degree possession of heroin,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:35-10a(1), and fourth-degree resisting arrest, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2a(2).\n\n      The State made a joint plea offer to defendants. The proposed agreement\n\nwas conditioned upon each defendant pleading guilty. One defendant would\n\nplead guilty to second-degree aggravated assault, with a recommended eight-\n\nyear sentence subject to NERA, while the other defendant would plead to\n\nsecond-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, for which the State would\n\nrecommend a sentence in the third-degree range. Co-defendant Greene rejected\n\nthe dual plea offer and elected to proceed to trial.\n\n      Defendant continued his plea negotiations, and eventually at a pretrial\n\nconference he advised the court through trial counsel that he did not want to go\n\nto trial and was willing to plead to second-degree aggravated assault in exchange\n\nfor a five-year sentence. However, the State indicated that it would agree to\n\nthose terms only if defendant agreed to inculpate Greene. Plea negotiations with\n\ndefendant ceased, as the State conditioned defendant's plea on getting a plea\n\nfrom Greene. The following colloquy between the trial court and defendant took\n\nplace at a pretrial conference:\n\n            THE COURT: Mr. Dukes, you know what the deal is\n            here. I can't force the prosecutor to give you a deal that\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                         5\n\fhe doesn't want to give you. You want \u2013 he wants to\ngive you five years. . . . Mr. Dukes you were present in\ncourt when I spoke to Mr. Greene, you understand\nwhat's at risk here, right? You have priors?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: All right. So you understand what's at\nrisk here. If you're convicted, conceivably you can go\nto prison for the rest of your life, right? The\nprosecutor's offering you five years, but he wants you\nto inculpate Mr. Greene who's seated right next to you.\nBecause the prosecutor thinks that he was involved to\nthe same extent that you were involved in this robbery.\nI understand your position is . . . I want the deal, I want\nto tell the truth, but the truth is, Mr. Greene wasn't\ninvolved to the same extent that I was involved in,\nright?\n\nDEFENDANT: Exactly.\n\nTHE COURT: Right. But I can't give you that deal\nbecause the deals don't come from me, the deal comes\nfrom the prosecutor. You understand that? So right\nnow \u2013 and you know what the proofs are in this case,\nbecause the prosecutor just laid it out on the record\nwhen we spoke about Mr. Greene. So all we can do\nhere is schedule this matter for trial. You have two\nchoices. We can go to trial, you know what the risks\nare. Or you can take the deal, but the deal that the\nprosecutor is demanding is that you give up Mr. \u2013 you\ngive up Mr. Greene, you understand that? All right. So\nwhat we're [going to] do is, we're scheduling this for\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              A-2227-22\n                            6\n\f      After defendant's trial, a jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree\n\nrobbery, second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of second-\n\ndegree aggravated assault, third-degree heroin possession, and resisting arrest.\n\nThe court sentenced defendant to an aggregate thirty-four-year term of\n\nincarceration.   We affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence on direct\n\nappeal. Dukes, slip op. at 6-10.\n\n      Defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief, alleging: his ability to\n\naccept a lesser plea was hindered by personal conflict between his trial counsel\n\nand the assistant prosecutor representing the State; his attorney failed to\n\ninvestigate potential alibi witnesses; and other errors by his trial attorney\n\namounted to cumulative error contrary to his right to effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Defendant also argued that \"inconsistent and questionable\" witness\n\ntestimony compromised his right to a fair trial.\n\n      The PCR court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing, making\n\noral findings. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim, finding the record did not support the theory that a personal dispute\n\nbetween counsel and the prosecutor caused negotiations to fail. The court also\n\nfound defendant presented no facts to support a potential alibi, and that if he\n\nhad, any testimony regarding an alibi would have been undermined by\n\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                        7\n\fdefendant's admission he was at the scene. The court also found that other errors\n\nalleged by defendant, such as failing to file certain pre-trial motions, did not\n\nconstitute a prima facie cause of ineffective assistance of counsel, and concluded\n\nthere was no cumulative error. Finally, the court determined that certain of\n\ndefendant's arguments were inapposite for PCR because they should have been\n\nraised on direct appeal.\n\n      Defendant raises the following points in his appeal:\n\n            POINT I:\n\n            THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT\n            DEFENDANT WAS NOT DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE     OF    TRIAL    COUNSEL.\n            ALTERNATIVELY, DEFENDANT ESTABLISHED\n            A PRIMA FACIE CLAIM OF INEFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL WHICH WAS\n            SUPPORTED BY MATERIAL ISSUES OF\n            DISPUTED FACTS LYING OUTSIDE THE\n            RECORD. THE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTED\n            FACTS NECESSITATED AN EVIDENTIARY\n            HEARING. THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FAILING\n            TO CONDUCT SUCH A HEARING.\n\n            POINT II:\n\n            FOR THE REASONS EXPRESSED IN POINT I,\n            SUPRA, THE PCR COURT ERRED WHEN IT\n            RULED THAT DEFENDANT FAILED TO\n            ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF\n            INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL.\n            THIS ERROR LED IT TO ERRONEOUSLY REJECT\n            DEFENDANT'S CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR.\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                        8\n\f            POINT III:\n\n            DEFENDANT      WAS     CONVICTED     BY\n            INCONSISTENT     AND      QUESTIONABLE\n            WITNESSES' TESTIMONIES. BASIC FAIR PLAY\n            AND FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS REQUIRED\n            THAT HE BE GRANTED A NEW TRIAL BY THE\n            PCR COURT.\n\n                                 II.\n\n      We use a de novo standard of review when a PCR court denies relief\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing. State v. Aburoumi, 464 N.J. Super. 326, 338\n\n(App. Div. 2020); see also State v. Nash, 212 N.J. 518, 540-41 (2013). Our rules\n\nrequire a court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition, \"only upon\n\nthe establishment of a prima facie case in support of post-conviction relief.\" R.\n\n3:22-10(b). \"A prima facie case is established when a defendant demonstrates\n\n'a reasonable likelihood that his or her claim, viewing the facts alleged in the\n\nlight most favorable to the defendant, will ultimately succeed on the merits.'\"\n\nState v. Porter, 216 N.J. 343, 355 (2013) (quoting R. 3:22-10(b)).\n\n      To establish a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\ndefendant must show: (1) counsel's performance was deficient; and (2) the\n\ndeficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; State v. Fritz,\n\n105 N.J. 42, 52 (1987) (adopting Strickland). A successful showing requires\n\ndefendant to establish \"by a preponderance of the credible evidence\" entitlement\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                       9\n\fto the requested relief. Nash, 212 N.J. at 541 (quoting State v. Preciose, 129\n\nN.J. 451, 459 (1992)).\n\n      To satisfy the first Strickland prong, \"a defendant must overcome a 'strong\n\npresumption' that counsel exercised 'reasonable professional judgment' and\n\n'sound trial strategy' in fulfilling [their] responsibilities.\" State v. Hess, 207 N.J.\n\n123, 147 (2011) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689-90). \"[I]f counsel makes\n\na thorough investigation of the law and facts and considers all likely options,\n\ncounsel's trial strategy is 'virtually unchallengeable.'\" State v. Chew, 179 N.J.\n\n186, 217 (2004) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91).\n\n      Because prejudice under Strickland's second prong is not presumed, Fritz,\n\n105 N.J. at 52, a defendant must demonstrate \"how specific errors of counsel\n\nundermined the reliability\" of the proceeding. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S.\n\n648, 659 n.26 (1984). To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is\n\na probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d             State v.\n\nGideon, 244 N.J. 538, 550-51 (2021) (alteration in original) (quoting Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 694).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                A-2227-22\n                                         10\n\f                                       III.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      Defendant argues he did not receive effective assistance of counsel during\n\nplea negotiations. Specifically, he contends that he wanted to accept a plea\n\noffer, but the offer was rescinded because of interpersonal conflict between trial\n\ncounsel and the assistant prosecutor. He alleges trial counsel informed him of\n\nthis ongoing conflict. Plaintiff posits this issue at least represents a factual\n\nquestion which justifies an evidentiary hearing. We disagree.\n\n      \"A defendant asserting plea counsel's assistance was ineffective may meet\n\nthe first prong of the Strickland standard if the defendant can show counsel's\n\nrepresentation fell short of the prevailing standards expected of criminal defense\n\nattorneys.\" State v. Vanness, 474 N.J. Super. 609, 624 (App. Div. 2023) (citing\n\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 366-67 (2010)). \"Plea counsel's performance\n\nwill not be deemed deficient if counsel has provided the defendant 'correct\n\ninformation concerning all of the relevant material consequences that flow from\n\nsuch a plea.'\" Id. at 624 (quoting State v. Agathis, 424 N.J. Super. 16, 22 (App.\n\nDiv. 2012)); see also Nu\u00f1ez-Valdez, 200 N.J. 129, 138-39 (2009).\n\n      Defendant fails to establish a prima facie claim for ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel during his plea negotiations. His claim that his plea was rescinded\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       11\n\fdue to personal issues between the lawyers is not borne out in the record. Even\n\naccepting defendant's claims about conflict as true, the record shows defendant's\n\npredicament was entirely attributable to either Greene's refusal to plead or his\n\nrefusal to testify against Greene.\n\n      The colloquy at his plea hearing shows defendant clearly understood the\n\nrequirements of the proposed plea agreement and the potential ramifications of\n\ngoing to trial. His decision to proceed to trial was knowing and voluntary. The\n\nrecord further shows trial counsel worked diligently to obtain a non-contingent\n\nplea offer from the State, even requesting a meeting with the assistant\n\nprosecutor's supervisor. Defendant failed to present proof that trial counsel\n\nprovided him with inaccurate or incomplete information during plea\n\nnegotiations.   On this question, defendant has failed to show ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n                                       B.\n\n      Defendant argues his trial counsel failed to fully investigate his case. He\n\nalleges that he asked his attorney to speak with two alibi witnesses, but counsel\n\nnever did. He contends this was ineffective assistance of counsel. We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                      12\n\f      \"Failure to investigate an alibi defense is a serious deficiency that can\n\nresult in the reversal of a conviction.\" Porter, 216 N.J. at 353. \"Indeed, 'few\n\ndefenses have greater potential for creating reasonable doubt as to a defendant's\n\nguilt in the minds of the jury [than an alibi].'\" Ibid. (quoting State v. Mitchell,\n\n149 N.J. Super. 259, 262 (App. Div. 1977)). A PCR petitioner asserting that his\n\ntrial attorney inadequately investigated a potential witness \"must assert the facts\n\nthat an investigation would have revealed, supported by affidavits or\n\ncertifications based upon the personal knowledge of the affiant or the person\n\nmaking the certification.\" Ibid. (quoting State v. Cummings, 321 N.J. Super.\n\n154, 170 (App. Div. 1999)).\n\n      Defendant's claim has no merit, as he fails to assert any specific facts\n\nwhich an investigation of his alibi witnesses would have revealed. Even if\n\ncounsel erred in failing to contact these witnesses, any potential testimony they\n\nmight have offered regarding an alibi would be critically undermined by\n\ndefendant's own admission placing himself at the scene, so he cannot show\n\nprejudice under the second prong of Strickland.\n\n      In a related argument, defendant suggests the PCR court erred by rejecting\n\nhis claim that his admission placing himself at the scene of the crime was not\n\nprobative of his guilt. Defendant's attempt to persuade the PCR court, and now\n\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                       13\n\fus, that this fact is not dispositive on a Strickland prong two analysis has no\n\nmerit. His argument that being present at the scene of the crime does not\n\nconclusively establish guilt misses the point. While true, it is not relevant in a\n\nStrickland analysis, as an alibi witness could not credibly support a theory that\n\ndefendant was present at the scene, but was somehow not the assailant.\n\nDefendant failed to present proof of ineffective assistance of counsel on this\n\nquestion and, if he had, he could not have overcome his own admission in order\n\nto show prejudice.\n\n                                        C.\n\n        Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file\n\nmotions for suppression, dismissal of the indictment, and for a Wade1 hearing.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n        A motion to suppress evidence seized at the scene of the arrest would have\n\nfailed as the heroin, which he was observed discarding while fleeing the police,\n\nwas lawfully seized as abandoned property. See State v. Johnson, 193 N.J. 528,\n\n548-549 (2008).      Similarly, a Wade hearing to challenge his out-of-court\n\nidentification by witnesses would have been futile, as witnesses were never able\n\n\n\n\n1\n    United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967).\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                        14\n\fto identify defendant. Defendant placed himself at the scene. See Pressler &\n\nVerniero, Current N.J. Court Rules, cmt. 2 on R. 3:11 (2024).\n\n      Finally, a motion to dismiss the indictment would not have succeeded as\n\ndefendant has not alleged any defect in the indictment. See State v. Bell, 241\n\nN.J. 552, 560 (2020) (\"[A] court should dismiss [an] indictment 'only on the\n\nclearest and plainest ground, and only when the indictment is manifestly\n\ndeficient or palpably defective.'\" (quoting State v. Twiggs, 233 N.J. 513, 531-\n\n32 (2018))).\n\n      Again, defendant has not established a prima facie case for ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel under Strickland.\n\n                                       D.\n\n      Defendant argues a new trial is warranted based on the doctrine of\n\nfundamental fairness pursuant to Rule 3:20-1, because he was convicted based\n\non inconsistent evidence.    Defendant specifically submits that none of the\n\nvictims were able to identify him as an assailant. A petition for PCR is not the\n\nproper vehicle for these arguments.\n\n      Grounds for a motion for post-conviction relief are limited and include:\n\n(1) deprivations of defendant's constitutional rights; (2) lack of jurisdiction by\n\nthe trial court; (3) illegal sentences; (4) collateral attack by habeus corpus or\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       15\n\fother common-law or statutory remedy; and (5) ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. R. 3:22-2. Issues that could have been raised in prior proceedings are\n\ngenerally barred from being brought in a PCR. R. 3:22-4(a).\n\n      Defendant's fundamental fairness claims are not cognizable on this record.\n\nTo the extent defendant argues for a new trial in the interest of justice pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:20-2, defendant's argument claim is time barred, as he did not raise it\n\nwithin 10 days of the jury's verdict or offer newly-discovered evidence. To the\n\nextent defendant argues sufficiency of the evidence, it was argued in his direct\n\nappeal, and cannot be raised again in a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:22. The PCR court properly rejected these claims.\n\n      To the extent we have not addressed defendant's remaining arguments, we\n\nconclude they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(2).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       16\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                               APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not &quot;constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .&quot; Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited.

After a trial, defendant was convicted on robbery, aggravated assault,\n\nand drug possession charges and was sentenced to an aggregate term of thirty-\n\nfour years subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2.\n\nWe affirmed on direct appeal, and defendant filed his petition, which the trial\n\ncourt denied without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant contends the PCR court\n\nerred by rejecting his claims that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nHe contends, among other things, trial counsel failed to:        investigate alibi\n\nwitnesses; file certain motions; and obtain a plea offer from the State. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      We glean the facts and relevant procedural history in part from our opinion\n\naffirming defendant&#x27;s conviction and sentence, State v. Dukes, No. A-4668-17\n\n(App. Div. Mar. 26, 2021) (slip op. at 4).\n\n                  During the early morning hours of April 10,\n            2017, [the three victims] Rodriguez, Ramos-Sanchez,\n            and Paz left a nightclub and headed towards a\n            restaurant. A nearby surveillance camera captured\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                        2\n\fthem on film as they passed by shortly before the\nrobbery. At trial, Rodriguez identified the man, seen\nwearing a hat, walking behind the group almost\nimmediately after they went out of camera range, as the\nperson who punched him in the head from behind,\nknocking him to the ground. Paz screamed for help,\nsomehow fell, broke her ankle, and rolled beneath a\nparked car. Rodriguez attempted to get up to help her,\nbut [he] was struck again by the man with a hat, this\ntime with an object. That blow left a laceration on\nRodriguez&#x27;s forehead requiring twelve stitches that left\na visible scar shown to the jury. The man with the hat\ndemanded Rodriguez&#x27;s money and searched his\npockets.\n\n      ....\n\n      Paz&#x27;s recollection was that as the group was\nwalking, someone demanded their money. She thought\nthe assailants were in front of the group but could not\nbe certain.\n\n      Ramos-Sanchez said she saw two men approach\nfrom the rear and heard them demand money; she was\nsprayed in the face with an irritant. She immediately\nran to an intersecting street, and the men chasing her\nturned away. Ramos-Sanchez encountered pedestrians\nleaving a bar, who called the police on her behalf. Her\neye remained cloudy after the incident, although she\nrefused medical attention at the time.\n\n      None of the victims, who had been drinking,\ncould identify their attackers. Rodriguez remembered\nonly that the man who struck him in the forehead wore\ndark clothes and a cap. He initially thought he was hit\nwith a gun, but over time became uncertain as to the\nnature of the object. Rodriguez and Ramos-Sanchez\n\n\n                                                           A-2227-22\n                           3\n\f           were sure there were only two assailants; Paz thought\n           there may have been three or four.\n\n                 New Brunswick Police Sergeant Theirry\n           Lemmerling obtained the surveillance videos, shown to\n           the jury, from two neighborhood stores.                He\n           downloaded them onto a flash drive, then transferring\n           them to a disc. During trial, all three victims identified\n           themselves on the video. The person walking closest to\n           the group as it leaves camera range was wearing a hat.\n           Lemmerling made still photographs from the video\n           footage of the two men walking behind the victims,\n           including the man with a hat. A few days later, two\n           New Brunswick police officers drove by defendant\n           standing at a corner. They had been shown the still\n           photograph that morning and knew there was an\n           outstanding warrant for his arrest related to the robbery.\n           The officers stopped, and when one of them told\n           defendant he had an arrest warrant, defendant fled. A\n           third officer saw defendant running, saw him discard\n           ten glassine envelopes containing heroin and fiorinal\n           fentanyl, and caught him. When arrested, defendant\n           was carrying a can of pepper spray.\n\n                 At the station, New Brunswick Police\n           Department Detective Brandt Gregus questioned\n           defendant and showed him the still photo. Defendant\n           admitted he was the man wearing a hat walking a few\n           paces behind the three victims[,] moments before the\n           robbery. That picture was admitted into evidence and\n           shown to the jury when Gregus testified.\n\n     Defendant was indicted by a grand jury, and charged, along with a co-\n\ndefendant, Ricky Greene, with: three counts of first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:15-1; second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(a) and\n\n\n                                                                        A-2227-22\n                                       4\n\f2C:15-1; and two counts of second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-\n\n1b(1). Defendant alone was also charged with third-degree possession of heroin,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:35-10a(1), and fourth-degree resisting arrest, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2a(2).\n\n      The State made a joint plea offer to defendants. The proposed agreement\n\nwas conditioned upon each defendant pleading guilty. One defendant would\n\nplead guilty to second-degree aggravated assault, with a recommended eight-\n\nyear sentence subject to NERA, while the other defendant would plead to\n\nsecond-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, for which the State would\n\nrecommend a sentence in the third-degree range. Co-defendant Greene rejected\n\nthe dual plea offer and elected to proceed to trial.\n\n      Defendant continued his plea negotiations, and eventually at a pretrial\n\nconference he advised the court through trial counsel that he did not want to go\n\nto trial and was willing to plead to second-degree aggravated assault in exchange\n\nfor a five-year sentence. However, the State indicated that it would agree to\n\nthose terms only if defendant agreed to inculpate Greene. Plea negotiations with\n\ndefendant ceased, as the State conditioned defendant&#x27;s plea on getting a plea\n\nfrom Greene. The following colloquy between the trial court and defendant took\n\nplace at a pretrial conference:\n\n            THE COURT: Mr. Dukes, you know what the deal is\n            here. I can&#x27;t force the prosecutor to give you a deal that\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                         5\n\fhe doesn&#x27;t want to give you. You want \u2013 he wants to\ngive you five years. . . . Mr. Dukes you were present in\ncourt when I spoke to Mr. Greene, you understand\nwhat&#x27;s at risk here, right? You have priors?\n\nDEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: All right. So you understand what&#x27;s at\nrisk here. If you&#x27;re convicted, conceivably you can go\nto prison for the rest of your life, right? The\nprosecutor&#x27;s offering you five years, but he wants you\nto inculpate Mr. Greene who&#x27;s seated right next to you.\nBecause the prosecutor thinks that he was involved to\nthe same extent that you were involved in this robbery.\nI understand your position is . . . I want the deal, I want\nto tell the truth, but the truth is, Mr. Greene wasn&#x27;t\ninvolved to the same extent that I was involved in,\nright?\n\nDEFENDANT: Exactly.\n\nTHE COURT: Right. But I can&#x27;t give you that deal\nbecause the deals don&#x27;t come from me, the deal comes\nfrom the prosecutor. You understand that? So right\nnow \u2013 and you know what the proofs are in this case,\nbecause the prosecutor just laid it out on the record\nwhen we spoke about Mr. Greene. So all we can do\nhere is schedule this matter for trial. You have two\nchoices. We can go to trial, you know what the risks\nare. Or you can take the deal, but the deal that the\nprosecutor is demanding is that you give up Mr. \u2013 you\ngive up Mr. Greene, you understand that? All right. So\nwhat we&#x27;re [going to] do is, we&#x27;re scheduling this for\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              A-2227-22\n                            6\n\f      After defendant&#x27;s trial, a jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree\n\nrobbery, second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of second-\n\ndegree aggravated assault, third-degree heroin possession, and resisting arrest.\n\nThe court sentenced defendant to an aggregate thirty-four-year term of\n\nincarceration.   We affirmed defendant&#x27;s conviction and sentence on direct\n\nappeal. Dukes, slip op. at 6-10.\n\n      Defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief, alleging: his ability to\n\naccept a lesser plea was hindered by personal conflict between his trial counsel\n\nand the assistant prosecutor representing the State; his attorney failed to\n\ninvestigate potential alibi witnesses; and other errors by his trial attorney\n\namounted to cumulative error contrary to his right to effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Defendant also argued that &quot;inconsistent and questionable&quot; witness\n\ntestimony compromised his right to a fair trial.\n\n      The PCR court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing, making\n\noral findings. The court rejected defendant&#x27;s ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim, finding the record did not support the theory that a personal dispute\n\nbetween counsel and the prosecutor caused negotiations to fail. The court also\n\nfound defendant presented no facts to support a potential alibi, and that if he\n\nhad, any testimony regarding an alibi would have been undermined by\n\n\n                                                                           A-2227-22\n                                        7\n\fdefendant&#x27;s admission he was at the scene. The court also found that other errors\n\nalleged by defendant, such as failing to file certain pre-trial motions, did not\n\nconstitute a prima facie cause of ineffective assistance of counsel, and concluded\n\nthere was no cumulative error. Finally, the court determined that certain of\n\ndefendant&#x27;s arguments were inapposite for PCR because they should have been\n\nraised on direct appeal.\n\n      Defendant raises the following points in his appeal:\n\n            POINT I:\n\n            THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT\n            DEFENDANT WAS NOT DENIED THE EFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE     OF    TRIAL    COUNSEL.\n            ALTERNATIVELY, DEFENDANT ESTABLISHED\n            A PRIMA FACIE CLAIM OF INEFFECTIVE\n            ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL WHICH WAS\n            SUPPORTED BY MATERIAL ISSUES OF\n            DISPUTED FACTS LYING OUTSIDE THE\n            RECORD.

Even if\n\ncounsel erred in failing to contact these witnesses, any potential testimony they\n\nmight have offered regarding an alibi would be critically undermined by\n\ndefendant&#x27;s own admission placing himself at the scene, so he cannot show\n\nprejudice under the second prong of Strickland.\n\n      In a related argument, defendant suggests the PCR court erred by rejecting\n\nhis claim that his admission placing himself at the scene of the crime was not\n\nprobative of his guilt. Defendant&#x27;s attempt to persuade the PCR court, and now\n\n\n                                                                             A-2227-22\n                                       13\n\fus, that this fact is not dispositive on a Strickland prong two analysis has no\n\nmerit. His argument that being present at the scene of the crime does not\n\nconclusively establish guilt misses the point. While true, it is not relevant in a\n\nStrickland analysis, as an alibi witness could not credibly support a theory that\n\ndefendant was present at the scene, but was somehow not the assailant.\n\nDefendant failed to present proof of ineffective assistance of counsel on this\n\nquestion and, if he had, he could not have overcome his own admission in order\n\nto show prejudice.\n\n                                        C.\n\n        Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file\n\nmotions for suppression, dismissal of the indictment, and for a Wade1 hearing.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n        A motion to suppress evidence seized at the scene of the arrest would have\n\nfailed as the heroin, which he was observed discarding while fleeing the police,\n\nwas lawfully seized as abandoned property.

Defendant placed himself at the scene. See Pressler &amp;\n\nVerniero, Current N.J.

Defendant specifically submits that none of the\n\nvictims were able to identify him as an assailant. A petition for PCR is not the\n\nproper vehicle for these arguments.\n\n      Grounds for a motion for post-conviction relief are limited and include:\n\n(1) deprivations of defendant&#x27;s constitutional rights; (2) lack of jurisdiction by\n\nthe trial court; (3) illegal sentences; (4) collateral attack by habeus corpus or\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       15\n\fother common-law or statutory remedy; and (5) ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. R. 3:22-2. Issues that could have been raised in prior proceedings are\n\ngenerally barred from being brought in a PCR. R. 3:22-4(a).\n\n      Defendant&#x27;s fundamental fairness claims are not cognizable on this record.\n\nTo the extent defendant argues for a new trial in the interest of justice pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:20-2, defendant&#x27;s argument claim is time barred, as he did not raise it\n\nwithin 10 days of the jury&#x27;s verdict or offer newly-discovered evidence. To the\n\nextent defendant argues sufficiency of the evidence, it was argued in his direct\n\nappeal, and cannot be raised again in a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant\n\nto Rule 3:22. The PCR court properly rejected these claims.\n\n      To the extent we have not addressed defendant&#x27;s remaining arguments, we\n\nconclude they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(2).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2227-22\n                                       16\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1723/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107486/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111169/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1441375/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1516609/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1968214/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1988810/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2309234/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2323789/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2356936/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2646767/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7323712/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7328806/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8228897/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925349/", "id": 9925349, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467511/thomas-maino-and-pba-local-no-295-v-little-egg-harbor-township/", "cluster_id": 9467511, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467511/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T07:08:30.504211-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T07:08:30.743133-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "f774474ae10d45b416451adfb34c8a30d83ade3f", "page_count": 2, "download_url": "https://www.njcourts.gov/system/files/court-opinions/2024/a1239-22.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/thomas_maino_and_pba_local_no._295_v._little_egg_harbor_township.pdf", "plain_text": "                                NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                               APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not \"constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .\" Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited.

No. S-23-195.\n\n                 1. Judgments: Appeal and Error. When a jurisdictional question does not\n                    involve a factual dispute, the issue is a matter of law. An appellate court\n                    reviews questions of law independently of the lower court\u2019s conclusion.\n                 2. Rules of Evidence. In proceedings where the Nebraska Evidence Rules\n                    apply, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by these rules; judicial\n                    discretion is involved only when the rules make discretion a factor in\n                    determining admissibility.\n                 3. Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists when\n                    the reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly\n                    depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in mat-\n                    ters submitted for disposition.\n                 4. Rules of Evidence: Hearsay: Appeal and Error. Apart from rul-\n                    ings under the residual hearsay exception, an appellate court reviews\n                    for clear error the factual findings underpinning a trial court\u2019s hear-\n                    say ruling and reviews de novo the court\u2019s ultimate determination to\n                    admit evidence over a hearsay objection or exclude evidence on hear-\n                    say grounds.\n                 5. Jurisdiction. One who invokes the power of the court on an issue other\n                    than the court\u2019s jurisdiction over one\u2019s person makes a general appear-\n                    ance so as to confer on the court personal jurisdiction over that person.\n                 6. Jurisdiction: Pleadings: Parties. A party will be deemed to have\n                    appeared generally if, by motion or other form of application to the\n                    court, he or she seeks to bring its powers into action on any matter other\n                    than the question of jurisdiction over that party.\n                 7. Judgments: Appeal and Error. An appellate court may affirm a lower\n                    court\u2019s ruling that reaches the correct result, albeit based on differ-\n                    ent reasoning.\n                 8.

An appellate court\n                    reviews questions of law independently of the lower court\u2019s conclusion.\n                 2. Rules of Evidence. In proceedings where the Nebraska Evidence Rules\n                    apply, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by these rules; judicial\n                    discretion is involved only when the rules make discretion a factor in\n                    determining admissibility.\n                 3. Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists when\n                    the reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly\n                    depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in mat-\n                    ters submitted for disposition.\n                 4. Rules of Evidence: Hearsay: Appeal and Error. Apart from rul-\n                    ings under the residual hearsay exception, an appellate court reviews\n                    for clear error the factual findings underpinning a trial court\u2019s hear-\n                    say ruling and reviews de novo the court\u2019s ultimate determination to\n                    admit evidence over a hearsay objection or exclude evidence on hear-\n                    say grounds.\n                 5. Jurisdiction. One who invokes the power of the court on an issue other\n                    than the court\u2019s jurisdiction over one\u2019s person makes a general appear-\n                    ance so as to confer on the court personal jurisdiction over that person.\n                 6. Jurisdiction: Pleadings: Parties. A party will be deemed to have\n                    appeared generally if, by motion or other form of application to the\n                    court, he or she seeks to bring its powers into action on any matter other\n                    than the question of jurisdiction over that party.\n                 7. Judgments: Appeal and Error. An appellate court may affirm a lower\n                    court\u2019s ruling that reaches the correct result, albeit based on differ-\n                    ent reasoning.\n                 8.

It provided notice to Christian that\nif he wished to appear and show cause why the order should\nnot remain in effect, he needed to complete the provided\n\u201cRequest for Hearing\u201d form and return it to the clerk of the\ndistrict court within 10 business days. An information sheet\nincluded with the ex parte order stated that the court would\nschedule a hearing within 30 days after reviewing the request\nfor a hearing.\n   Three days later, the court received Christian\u2019s request for\nhearing form. Later that day, the court entered an order which\nset a hearing on Monday, January 30, 2023, at 10:30 a.m.\nThe certificate of service showed that the order was sent to\nChristian via U.S. mail on January 24.\n   On January 30, 2023, Christian did not appear for the hear-\ning. The same day, the court entered an order affirming the\nprotection order.\n              Motion to Vacate Proceedings\n   Ten days later, Christian filed a motion to vacate the\nJanuary 30, 2023, order.

He also claimed that the district court\nlacked personal jurisdiction over him. He attached an affidavit\nto this motion. The affidavit included an exhibit purporting to\nbe an email from the U.S. Postal Service.\n   During a hearing on the motion to vacate, Christian asserted\nthat the court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter a final\nprotection order against a nonresident respondent. The court\ninquired whether Christian submitted himself to the court\u2019s\njurisdiction when he requested a hearing. Christian argued\nthat no one could know whether he requested a hearing\nfor the purpose of challenging personal jurisdiction. Paw\u2019s\ncounsel \u201cremind[ed]\u201d the court that \u201cin the parties\u2019 pater-\nnity/custody case, [Christian was] ordered to come here to\nNebraska to pick up his child to bring him back to Iowa every\nother weekend.\u201d\n   During the hearing, Christian offered his own affidavit with\na copy of an email attached to it. The copy of the email dif-\nfered somewhat from the one attached to his earlier affida-\nvit. Christian\u2019s affidavit stated that he did not receive the\ncourt\u2019s order for hearing until the afternoon of January 30,\n2023. He averred that the attached email had been transmit-\nted from \u201c\u2018USPS Informed Delivery\u2019\u201d to his email address at\n7:24 a.m. on January 30. The email included an image of the\nfront of an envelope from the clerk of the district court. Paw\nobjected based on foundation and hearsay. Christian argued\nthat the rules of evidence do not apply during a hearing on a\nmotion to vacate. Nonetheless, the court sustained Paw\u2019s hear-\nsay objection.\n   The court subsequently entered an order overruling the\nmotion to vacate. With respect to personal jurisdiction, the\ncourt reasoned that \u201c[t]he incidents of abuse occurred in\nNebraska and were part of regular contact from [Christian]\nto [Paw] in Nebraska.\u201d Although the bill of exceptions of\nthe hearing on the motion to vacate did not show a ruling on\nPaw\u2019s foundational objection, the order stated that the court\nsustained \u201cthe objections.\u201d It further stated that Christian\u2019s\n\f                                  - 785 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                        PAW K.

The Court of Appeals deter-\nmined that Christian\u2019s affidavit was hearsay because it consti-\ntuted an out-of-court statement offered to prove that Christian\nwas not served the order for hearing until after the hearing\nhad occurred.\n   We start with the extreme positions advocated by the par-\nties. On one side, Christian asserted in his appellate brief\nthat \u201can affidavit . . . is always admissible in support of a\nmotion.\u201d 15 He backs away slightly from this absolutist view\nin his petition for further review, asserting that \u201can affidavit\nmay always be used to impeach service and object to personal\njurisdiction.\u201d 16 On the other side, in connection with assert-\ning that Christian\u2019s affidavit failed to show lack of notice,\nPaw orally argued that Christian was served notice of the\nhearing when the clerk of the district court deposited the\n13\n   Schaeffer v.

We reject\nthese positions.\n   [9,10] An affidavit is one mode by which testimony of wit-\nnesses may be taken. 17 But an affidavit is regarded as the least\nsatisfactory mode of presenting testimony. 18 Affidavits are\nordinarily not considered competent evidence because they are\nnot subject to cross-examination, they combine facts and con-\nclusions, and they often omit or distort important facts. 19 An\naffidavit is competent evidence where authorized by statute or\nwhere not objected to on proper grounds by the party against\nwhom it is offered. 20 In the absence of statutory permission,\nan affidavit is not competent evidence, although made under\noath, because it is hearsay. 21\n   [11] Nebraska authorizes use of an affidavit for certain\npurposes. A statute specifically provides that \u201c[a]n affidavit\nmay be used to verify a pleading, to prove the service of a\nsummons, notice or other process, in an action, to obtain a\nprovisional remedy, an examination of a witness, a stay of pro-\nceedings, or upon a motion, and in any other case permitted\nby law.\u201d 22 This less satisfactory mode of presenting evidence\nis \u201c\u2018specially provided for to meet considerations of con-\nvenience or necessity.\u2019\u201d 23 Over a century ago, we remarked\nthat \u201c[t]he long-established practice has been to prove facts\n17\n   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Neb.

We cannot say that a trial\ncourt abuses its discretion by sustaining a hearsay objection\nto statements of third parties or to other averments not falling\nwithin a hearsay exception.\n   We recall the specific objection and ruling at the hearing on\nthe motion to vacate. Paw objected to the entire exhibit\u2014the\naffidavit and attachment\u2014on the grounds of hearsay and foun-\ndation. She elaborated:\n      On the original affidavit that was filed with this Court,\n      no email address is contained on this USPS alleged proof\n      that he didn\u2019t get service. And now, all of the sudden,\n      he has an affidavit that shows that email address. He\n      wouldn\u2019t have foundation to testify to that. And it, cer-\n      tainly, is hearsay.\nThe court stated that it was unaware of any authority refusing\nto apply the rules of evidence to the proceeding and then it\nsustained the hearsay objection.\n   The district court\u2019s corresponding written order expanded\non the foundational objection. It stated that Paw objected that\nthe affidavit was hearsay, that the affidavit did not lay founda-\ntion for the attachment, and that the attachment was altered\nand that the court \u201csustained the objections.\u201d According to\nthe order, Christian\u2019s argument \u201cdid not address the founda-\ntional issue with the attachment to the affidavit (or [Paw\u2019s]\nargument the attachment was altered)\u201d and that \u201ceven if the\naffidavit was received, the most it could show was that when\n[Christian] checked his mail in the afternoon of January 30,\n2023, the order for hearing was in his mail.\u201d\n   Thus, the critical question is whether the exhibit was partly\nadmissible and partly inadmissible.

Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. In reviewing a criminal\n                    conviction for a sufficiency of the evidence claim, whether the evidence\n                    is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the\n                    same: An appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,\n                    pass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and such\n                    matters are for the finder of fact. The relevant question for an appellate\n                    court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n                    to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\n                    tial elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                 2. Effectiveness of Counsel: Appeal and Error. Whether a claim of inef-\n                    fective assistance of counsel may be determined on direct appeal is a\n                    question of law.\n                 3. ____: ____. In reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on\n                    direct appeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\n                    facts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively deter-\n                    mine whether counsel did or did not provide effective assistance and\n                    whether the defendant was or was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged\n                    deficient performance.\n                 4. Juror Qualifications: Waiver. A party who fails to challenge the jurors\n                    for disqualification and passes the jurors for cause waives any objection\n                    to their selection.\n                 5. Criminal Law: Intent. The crime proscribed by Neb. Rev. Stat.\n                    \u00a7 28-311.01 (Reissue 2016) does not require an intent to execute the\n                    threats made; rather, it requires the intent to terrorize another as a result\n                    of the threats or a reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror.\n                 6. Criminal Law: Evidence: Intent. The intent with which an act is com-\n                    mitted is a mental process and may be inferred from the words and acts\n                    of the defendant and from the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\f                                    - 737 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     315 Nebraska Reports\n                               STATE V.

Washington,\n    466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the defendant\n    must show that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that\n    this deficient performance actually prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense.\n 8. Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof. To show that counsel\u2019s performance\n    was deficient, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance did not\n    equal that of a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in criminal law.\n 9. Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof: Words and Phrases. To show preju-\n    dice in a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must\n    demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient\n    performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n    A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confi-\n    dence in the outcome.\n10. Constitutional Law: Criminal Law: Jury Trials. The Sixth Amendment\n    secures to criminal defendants the right to be tried by an impartial jury\n    drawn from sources reflecting a fair cross-section of the community.\n11. Equal Protection: Jurors: Discrimination. The Equal Protection\n    Clause of the 14th Amendment forbids prosecutors from using\n    peremptory challenges to strike potential jurors solely on account of\n    their gender.\n12. Hearsay: Words and Phrases. Hearsay is a statement, other than one\n    made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n    evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n13. Hearsay. An out-of-court statement is not hearsay if the proponent\n    offers it for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted.\n14. Appeal and Error. An alleged error must be both specifically assigned\n    and specifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the error to be\n    considered by an appellate court.\n15. Pretrial Procedure: Pleadings: Evidence: Juries: Appeal and Error.\n    A motion in limine is a procedural step to prevent prejudicial evidence\n    from reaching the jury. It is not the office of a motion in limine to obtain\n    a final ruling upon the ultimate admissibility of the evidence. Therefore,\n    when a court overrules a motion in limine to exclude particular evi-\n    dence, the movant must object when the particular evidence is offered at\n    trial in order to predicate error before an appellate court.\n\n   Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Darla\nS.

INTRODUCTION\n   This is a direct appeal of convictions in the district court\nfor Lancaster County, Nebraska, for terroristic threats and\nthird degree sexual assault. The appellant argues that her trial\nbefore an all-male jury violated her constitutional rights to a\nfair trial and an impartial jury. The appellant also argues that\nthe evidence was insufficient to support her conviction for\nterroristic threats and that her trial counsel was ineffective in\nmultiple regards. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                      II. BACKGROUND\n   Early on the morning of January 14, 2020, Angelina M.\nClark entered the apartment where Shauna Parker and Parker\u2019s\n15-year-old son, A.L., resided. Clark knew Parker and A.L.\nand had visited their apartment previously. By her own admis-\nsion, Clark was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d when she entered the\napartment and during the events described below. 1\n   Parker testified that when Clark saw her, Clark asked,\n\u201c\u2018[D]o you know anything[?]\u2019\u201d Parker replied, \u201c\u2018[N]o I\ndon\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Parker explained that she understood Clark to be ask-\ning if she \u201cknew anything about having any drugs.\u201d However,\nParker acknowledged that Clark did not \u201cuse the word drugs.\u201d\nParker explained that she had just understood Clark\u2019s inquiry\nthat way.\n   Parker testified that after Clark had been in the apartment\nfor several minutes, Parker offered her a ride to \u201cget her\nout of [the] house.\u201d Parker drove a pickup truck. A.L., who\n1\n    Brief for appellant at 13.\n\f                              - 739 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. CLARK\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 736\n\naccompanied Parker and Clark, sat farthest right on the passen-\nger side. Clark was situated between Parker and A.L.\n   A.L. testified that during the drive, Clark placed her hand\non his \u201cupper thigh\u201d near his torso three to five times, \u201cgrop-\ning up towards [his] penis.\u201d According to A.L., the last time\nClark did so, she touched \u201c[his] private areas over [his] pants\u201d\nand then \u201cslightly squeezed\u201d before moving her hand back to\nhis thigh.\n   According to Parker, A.L. leaned away from Clark with a\n\u201chorrible look on his face.\u201d A.L.\u2019s expression prompted Parker\nto ask the reason for his discomfort. A.L. initially declined\nto answer until they dropped Clark off. However, Parker per-\nsisted in her questions, and A.L. eventually disclosed that\nClark \u201cma[de] him uncomfortable\u201d and that he did not \u201c\u2018like\n[Clark] touching [him].\u2019\u201d Parker and Clark then began to argue\nabout A.L.\n   Parker decided that Clark\u2019s ride was at an end and pulled\ninto the parking lot of a convenience store so Clark could\nget out of the truck. Parker testified that as she pulled in, she\nobserved Clark\u2019s hand on A.L.\u2019s \u201cinner thigh.\u201d\n   Parker demanded that Clark get out of the truck. Clark\ninitially refused, so Parker told A.L. to get out of the truck.\nParker testified that after exiting the vehicle and before going\ninto the convenience store, A.L. \u201cc[a]me around the truck\nand . . . said I feel violated mom. He said, \u2018she touched my\ndick.\u2019\u201d A.L. testified similarly that he came around the truck\nand told Parker that he \u201cfelt very uncomfortable and . . .\nneeded . . . Clark to leave.\u201d That was when Parker, by her\nown admission, \u201clost [her] temper.\u201d\n   When Clark subsequently got out of the truck and began\ncalling A.L.\u2019s name, Parker \u201cintervene[d]\u201d to keep Clark from\nfollowing A.L. into the store. Parker acknowledged that she\ninitiated a \u201cphysical confrontation\u201d with Clark by pushing or\nslapping her.\n   According to Parker, during that confrontation, Clark got\nback in the truck and \u201cstart[ed] rummaging through [it].\n\f                                   - 740 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

Like every-\nbody was going to beat me up, you know. I was done. And\n. . . she\u2019s going to have my ass beat or whatever.\u201d Parker\ntestified that Clark then grabbed what the parties variously\ndescribe as a box cutter or utility knife from the truck\u2019s glove\ncompartment and \u201cwas like bitch I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\n   A.L. observed the confrontation through the front door of\nthe convenience store. He saw Clark \u201cswinging [the box cut-\nter] around at [Parker].\u201d However, he was unable to hear what\nClark and Parker were saying.\n   Law enforcement was called. Clark left the scene before\nofficers arrived but was apprehended nearby. Clark was subse-\nquently charged with terroristic threats under Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-311.01 (Reissue 2016) and third degree sexual assault\nunder Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-320(1)(a) (Reissue 2016). She pled\nnot guilty, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.\n   Jury selection occurred on October 11, 2022. The record\ndoes not indicate how many prospective jurors were sum-\nmoned. It shows only that 27 prospective jurors were \u201cran-\ndomly selected\u201d to be seated up front. Other prospective jurors\nwere present. At least eight prospective jurors were female,\nbased on the titles used to refer to them during voir dire.\nHowever, everyone ultimately selected to serve on the jury\nwas male.\n   The jury found Clark guilty of both counts. She was sen-\ntenced to consecutive terms of 1 year\u2019s imprisonment, with\n9 months\u2019 post-release supervision, for the terroristic threats\nconviction and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for the sexual assault\nconviction.\n   Clark appeals, and we moved the matter to our docket. 2\n              III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Represented by different counsel on appeal, Clark assigns,\nrestated and reordered, that (1) the all-male jury deprived\n2\n    See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-1106(3) (Cum. Supp. 2022).\n\f                                 - 741 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE V.

She also assigns that her trial\ncounsel was ineffective in multiple regards.\n                 IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] In reviewing a criminal conviction for a sufficiency of\nthe evidence claim, whether the evidence is direct, circum-\nstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the same: An\nappellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass\non the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and\nsuch matters are for the finder of fact. 3 The relevant question\nfor an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. 4\n   [2,3] Whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nmay be determined on direct appeal is a question of law. 5 In\nreviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct\nappeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\nfacts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively\ndetermine whether counsel did or did not provide effective\nassistance and whether the defendant was or was not preju-\ndiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. 6\n                        V. ANALYSIS\n               1. Trial Before All-Male Jury\n   Clark argues that she was deprived of her rights under the\n6th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution to a fair\ntrial and an impartial jury because she was tried before an\nall-male jury. Clark acknowledges that \u201c\u2018[d]efendants are not\n3\n  State v. Lorello, 314 Neb. 385, 991 N.W.2d 11 (2023).\n4\n  Id.\n5\n  State v.

State, 11 we rejected the\ndefendant\u2019s claim that his conviction should be reversed\nbecause after the trial was completed, one of the jurors was\ndiscovered to have been formerly convicted of a felony. In so\ndoing, we reasoned:\n      Great latitude is allowed the defendant upon the voir dire\n      examination to enable him to ascertain whether there is\n      any ground for objecting to the juror. He cannot waive\n      an objection of this nature, and, after taking his chances\n      of an acquittal before the jury selected, insist upon an\n      objection which he should have raised upon the impan-\n      eling of the jury, and, if he makes no effort to ascertain\n      whether a juror offered is qualified to sit, he must be held\n      to have waived the objection. 12\n   [4] Our subsequent opinions clarified that Turley holds that\n\u201cwhen a defendant, through diligence, is able to discover a\nreason to challenge a juror, the objection to the juror must\n7\n   Brief for appellant at 12 (quoting Taylor v.

Nor does she dis-\npute that her trial counsel failed to challenge the jurors for\ndisqualification at the trial and passed the jurors for cause. To\nthe contrary, Clark alleges that her trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive for failing to object to the all-male jury. Accordingly, we\nagree with the State that Clark waived any objection to the\nall-male jury. We will, however, discuss her claim that the all-\nmale jury violated her constitutional rights to a fair trial and\nan impartial jury further below in conjunction with her claims\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.\n                 2. Sufficiency of Evidence as\n                     to Terroristic Threats\n  Clark also argues that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport her conviction for terroristic threats. In particular,\nshe argues that there was \u201cno direct evidence that points to\n[her] intent to actually terrorize\u201d Parker and that her words\nand actions and the surrounding circumstances fail to show\nsuch intent. 16 The State, on the other hand, argues that during\n13\n   State v.

In other words,\nthe crime proscribed by \u00a7 28-311.01 does not require an intent\nto execute the threats made; rather, it requires the intent to\nterrorize another as a result of the threats or a reckless dis-\nregard of the risk of causing terror to another. 18 In turn, for\npurposes of the crime of terroristic threats, the intent to ter-\nrorize another is an intent to produce intense fear or anxiety\nin another. 19 The intent with which an act is committed is a\nmental process and may be inferred from the words and acts\nof the defendant and from the circumstances surrounding\nthe incident. 20\n   In the present case, there was uncontroverted testimony\nfrom Parker that she and Clark were involved in a \u201cphysical\nconfrontation\u201d and that in the course of that confrontation,\nClark threatened to have her \u201cbeat[en] . . . up\u201d by various\npersons before grabbing a box cutter and saying, \u201c[B]itch I\u2019m\ngoing to kill you.\u201d Parker also testified that she was \u201ccon-\ncerned for [her] safety\u201d and backed away from Clark. Clark\u2019s\ntrial counsel pressed Parker about whether she \u201cbacked up\u201d out\nof fear of what Clark might do with the box cutter or because\nClark stepped out of the vehicle.

Section 28-311.01 does not require that the recipi-\nent of the threat be actually terrorized; rather, it requires that\nthe actor have the intent to terrorize the recipient as a result of\nthe threat or a reckless disregard of the risk of causing terror,\nas was previously noted. 21\n   We agree with the State that viewing the foregoing evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of\nfact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the essential\nelements of the crime of terroristic threats and, in particular,\nan intent to produce intense fear or anxiety in another. Prior\nopinions have upheld convictions for terroristic threats where\nthe defendant displayed a weapon 22 and made statements like\n\u201c\u2018consider yourself next on my list for a bullet\u2019\u201d 23 or \u201c\u2018\u201c[n]ow\nyou are going to get yours.\u201d\u2019\u201d 24\n   Clark\u2019s primary basis for arguing that the requisite intent\ncannot be inferred from her words and acts and the surrounding\ncircumstances is apparently that she was \u201cheavily intoxicated\nwhen the incident occurred.\u201d 25 Clark relies on our 1990 opinion\nin State v. Saltzman 26 for the proposition that while voluntary\nintoxication does not ordinarily justify or excuse a crime, an\naccused may be intoxicated to such an extent that \u201cthe accused\nis incapable of forming the intent required as an element of the\ncrime charged.\u201d\n21\n   Bryant, supra note 19.\n22\n   See, e.g., State v.

Rev.\nStat. \u00a7 29-122 (Reissue 2016), which provides that intoxica-\ntion may not be considered in determining the existence of a\nmental state that is an element of a criminal offense unless the\ndefendant proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that he\nor she did not know that the substance was intoxicating when\nhe or she ingested it or that the substance was not voluntarily\ningested. Clark points to no evidence showing that on the night\nin question, she did not know she was ingesting alcohol or that\nshe did not voluntarily ingest alcohol. As such, the fact that\nClark was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d 27 cannot be seen to preclude\nher from having had the requisite intent to terrorize Parker and\nproduce intense fear or anxiety in Parker.\n\n               3. Clark\u2019s Claims of Ineffective\n                  Assistance of Trial Counsel\n   In addition, Clark assigns that her trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive for (1) failing to object to the all-male jury, (2) failing to\nobject on hearsay grounds to Parker\u2019s testimony about A.L.\u2019s\nstatements regarding the sexual assault, and (3) failing to file\na motion in limine to exclude Parker\u2019s testimony that Clark\nasked about purchasing drugs.\n   When a defendant\u2019s trial counsel is different from his or her\ncounsel on direct appeal, the defendant must raise on direct\nappeal any issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective performance\nwhich is known to the defendant or is apparent from the\nrecord; otherwise, the issue will be procedurally barred in a\nsubsequent postconviction proceeding. 28 However, the fact that\nan ineffective assistance of counsel claim is raised on direct\nappeal does not necessarily mean that it can be resolved. 29\nThe determining factor is whether the record is sufficient to\n27\n   Brief for appellant at 13.\n28\n   State v.

Washington, 32 the defend\u00ad\nant must show that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was defi-\ncient and that this deficient performance actually prejudiced\nthe defendant\u2019s defense. 33 To show that counsel\u2019s performance\nwas deficient, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s perform\u00ad\nance did not equal that of a lawyer with ordinary training\nand skill in criminal law. 34 To show prejudice in a claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient\nperformance, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. 35 A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\nto undermine confidence in the outcome. 36\n   A court may examine performance and prejudice in any\norder and need not examine both prongs if a defendant fails to\ndemonstrate either. 37\n            (a) Failing to Object to All-Male Jury\n   Clark argues that her trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to object to the all-male jury.

The State, in turn, argues that trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance was not deficient and that Clark cannot show\nthat she was prejudiced thereby.\n   Clark likens her situation to that of the defendant in Taylor\nv. Louisiana. 39 In Taylor, a state law barred women from\nbeing selected for jury service unless they had previously\nfiled a written declaration of their desire to be subject to jury\nservice. 40 As a result, even though women represented 53 per-\ncent of the citizens eligible for jury service in the defendant\u2019s\njudicial district, there were no females on the 175-person\nvenire drawn for jury service in his case. 41 The defendant\nchallenged his conviction by an all-male jury, arguing that\nthe all-male jury violated his 6th and 14th Amendment right\nto an impartial jury trial. 42 The U.S. Supreme Court agreed. 43\nThe Court reasoned that the selection of a petit jury from a\n\u201crepresentative cross section of the community is an essential\ncomponent of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d 44 and\nthat this fair-cross-section requirement was violated by the\n\u201csystematic exclusion of women\u201d from the jury in the defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s case. 45\n38\n   Brief for appellant at 16.\n39\n   Taylor, supra note 7.\n40\n   Id.\n41\n   Id.\n42\n   Id.\n43\n   Id.\n44\n   Id., 419 U.S. at 528.\n45\n   Id., 419 U.S. at 531.\n\f                                    - 749 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

B., 46\nwherein the U.S. Supreme Court found that the State\u2019s use of\nperemptory challenges to exclude men from the jury, based\nsolely on their gender, violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the 14th Amendment. The State used 9 of its 10 peremp-\ntory challenges to remove males. 47 As a result, the State\u2019s case\nseeking to establish the petitioner\u2019s paternity and obligate him\nto pay child support was tried before an all-female jury. 48\n   Clark argues that even though the all-male jury in her case\nwas not due to a rule excluding women, \u201cthe result was the\nsame\u201d as in Taylor and J. E. B. 49 She also argues that the same\n\u201cconcerns brought up in Taylor [and J. E. B.] are present\u201d in\nher case. 50 Clark maintains that even if the all-male jury in her\ncase did not result from any \u201cpurposeful gender exclusion,\u201d\nit nonetheless deprived her of her right to a jury of her peers,\nand that the denial of that right warrants the reversal of her\nconvictions. 51 Clark similarly maintains that the statement in\nTaylor that while petit juries must be drawn from a source\nfairly representative of the community, \u201c\u2018[d]efendants are not\nentitled to a jury of any particular composition,\u2019\u201d 52 pertains\nonly to the relative number of males and females on the jury.\nIn Clark\u2019s view, the situation is different where there is the\n\u201ccomplete lack of a gender group.\u201d 53\n   [10,11] We have followed the principles set forth in Taylor,\nJ.

Specifically, to establish a prima facie\nviolation of the fair-cross-section requirement under the Sixth\nAmendment, a defendant must show that the underrepresenta-\ntion of the group alleged to be excluded is due to systematic\nexclusion of the group in the jury selection process, among\nother things. 56 Similarly, in order to show that a prosecutor\nhas used peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner\nin violation of the 14th Amendment, a defendant must first\nmake a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised\nperemptory challenges on the basis of gender. 57\n   Clark does not point to any evidence that women were\nsystematically excluded during the jury selection process to\nwhich her trial counsel failed to object. Nor does Clark point\nto any evidence that the prosecutor exercised peremptory chal-\nlenges on the basis of gender to which her trial counsel failed\nto object. Instead, Clark invites us to presume that \u201csome-\nthing did not happen as it should have during jury selection\u201d\nfrom the fact that the jurors selected were all male. 58 Like\n54\n   See, e.g., State v.

Parker also testified that after getting out\nof the truck at the convenience store, A.L. \u201cc[a]me around the\ntruck and . . . said I feel violated mom. He said, \u2018she touched\nmy dick.\u2019\u201d\n   It was those statements, all made within a span of 5 to 10\nminutes, that caused Parker to initiate the confrontation with\nClark during which Clark made the threats for which she\nwas subsequently prosecuted. Because the statements were not\nhearsay, any objection to them on that ground would have been\nmeritless. As such, Clark\u2019s claim that her trial counsel was\nineffective for failing to object on hearsay grounds to Parker\u2019s\ntestimony about A.L.\u2019s statements is without merit.\n             (c) Failing to File Motion in Limine\n                 to Exclude Statements About\n                       Purchase of Drugs\n   Clark\u2019s third and final claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel concerns Parker\u2019s testimony that shortly after enter-\ning Parker\u2019s apartment, Clark made an inquiry that Parker\nunderstood to refer to the purchase of drugs. Clark observes\nthat she was not charged with a controlled substance offense;\nnor was there any evidence that she was under the influence\nof a controlled substance at the time of the events in ques-\ntion. As such, she argues, Parker\u2019s testimony was unnecessary\nand prejudicial because \u201c[d]rugs are by nature considered\n\f                                 - 754 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    315 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE V.

Masters. 71 In Masters, we\nfound that testimony that the defendant \u201c\u2018had some type of\nconnection with drugs\u2019\u201d was so prejudicial that it required\nthe reversal of his conviction. 72 We emphasized, however, that\nthis outcome reflected the \u201cfactual context\u201d of that case. 73\n   [14] The present factual context is different. Most nota-\nbly, it is different in that Clark assigns as error only that her\ntrial counsel was ineffective for \u201cfail[ing] to file a [m]otion\nin [l]imine to keep out any statements regarding the pur-\nchase of drugs.\u201d She does not assign as error that her trial\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object to Parker\u2019s tes-\ntimony at trial, although she argues in her brief on appeal\nthat Clark \u201creceived ineffective assistance of counsel when\nthose statements were allowed in . . . without any objection\nby [t]rial [c]ounsel.\u201d 74 An alleged error must be both specifi-\ncally assigned and specifically argued in the brief of the party\nasserting the error to be considered by an appellate court. 75\nAs such, our review is limited to Clark\u2019s claim that her trial\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion in limine\nto exclude Parker\u2019s testimony.\n   [15] We find that even if trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to file a motion in limine, Clark cannot show that she\n69\n   Brief for appellant at 17.\n70\n   Id.\n71\n   State v.

A motion in limine is a procedural\nstep to prevent prejudicial evidence from reaching the jury. 76 It\nis not the office of a motion in limine to obtain a final ruling\nupon the ultimate admissibility of the evidence. 77 Therefore,\nwhen a court overrules a motion in limine to exclude par-\nticular evidence, the movant must object when the particular\nevidence is offered at trial in order to predicate error before an\nappellate court. 78 Here, however, Clark acknowledges that her\ntrial counsel did not object to Parker\u2019s testimony about Clark\u2019s\nalleged inquiry about drugs.\n   Accordingly, Clark cannot show that she suffered prejudice\nas a result of her trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion in\nlimine, because a motion in limine in and of itself, without\nany objection at trial, would have been futile, and Clark did\nnot assign that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nobject to the statement at trial. 79\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   Clark\u2019s claims that the all-male jury violated her constitu-\ntional rights, that there was insufficient evidence to support\nher conviction for terroristic threats, and that her trial counsel\nwas ineffective in multiple regards are without merit. As a\nresult, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                     Affirmed.\n76\n   Vaughn, supra note 64.\n77\n   Id.\n78\n   Id.\n79\n   See, e.g., State v.

Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. In reviewing a criminal\n                    conviction for a sufficiency of the evidence claim, whether the evidence\n                    is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the\n                    same: An appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,\n                    pass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and such\n                    matters are for the finder of fact. The relevant question for an appellate\n                    court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n                    to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\n                    tial elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                 2. Effectiveness of Counsel: Appeal and Error. Whether a claim of inef-\n                    fective assistance of counsel may be determined on direct appeal is a\n                    question of law.\n                 3. ____: ____. In reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on\n                    direct appeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\n                    facts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively deter-\n                    mine whether counsel did or did not provide effective assistance and\n                    whether the defendant was or was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged\n                    deficient performance.\n                 4. Juror Qualifications: Waiver. A party who fails to challenge the jurors\n                    for disqualification and passes the jurors for cause waives any objection\n                    to their selection.\n                 5.

An out-of-court statement is not hearsay if the proponent\n    offers it for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted.\n14. Appeal and Error.

BACKGROUND\n   Early on the morning of January 14, 2020, Angelina M.\nClark entered the apartment where Shauna Parker and Parker\u2019s\n15-year-old son, A.L., resided. Clark knew Parker and A.L.\nand had visited their apartment previously. By her own admis-\nsion, Clark was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d when she entered the\napartment and during the events described below. 1\n   Parker testified that when Clark saw her, Clark asked,\n\u201c\u2018[D]o you know anything[?]\u2019\u201d Parker replied, \u201c\u2018[N]o I\ndon\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Parker explained that she understood Clark to be ask-\ning if she \u201cknew anything about having any drugs.\u201d However,\nParker acknowledged that Clark did not \u201cuse the word drugs.\u201d\nParker explained that she had just understood Clark\u2019s inquiry\nthat way.\n   Parker testified that after Clark had been in the apartment\nfor several minutes, Parker offered her a ride to \u201cget her\nout of [the] house.\u201d Parker drove a pickup truck.

Clark was situated between Parker and A.L.\n   A.L. testified that during the drive, Clark placed her hand\non his \u201cupper thigh\u201d near his torso three to five times, \u201cgrop-\ning up towards [his] penis.\u201d According to A.L., the last time\nClark did so, she touched \u201c[his] private areas over [his] pants\u201d\nand then \u201cslightly squeezed\u201d before moving her hand back to\nhis thigh.\n   According to Parker, A.L. leaned away from Clark with a\n\u201chorrible look on his face.\u201d A.L.\u2019s expression prompted Parker\nto ask the reason for his discomfort. A.L. initially declined\nto answer until they dropped Clark off. However, Parker per-\nsisted in her questions, and A.L. eventually disclosed that\nClark \u201cma[de] him uncomfortable\u201d and that he did not \u201c\u2018like\n[Clark] touching [him].\u2019\u201d Parker and Clark then began to argue\nabout A.L.\n   Parker decided that Clark\u2019s ride was at an end and pulled\ninto the parking lot of a convenience store so Clark could\nget out of the truck. Parker testified that as she pulled in, she\nobserved Clark\u2019s hand on A.L.\u2019s \u201cinner thigh.\u201d\n   Parker demanded that Clark get out of the truck. Clark\ninitially refused, so Parker told A.L. to get out of the truck.\nParker testified that after exiting the vehicle and before going\ninto the convenience store, A.L. \u201cc[a]me around the truck\nand . . . said I feel violated mom. He said, \u2018she touched my\ndick.\u2019\u201d A.L. testified similarly that he came around the truck\nand told Parker that he \u201cfelt very uncomfortable and . . .\nneeded . . . Clark to leave.\u201d That was when Parker, by her\nown admission, \u201clost [her] temper.\u201d\n   When Clark subsequently got out of the truck and began\ncalling A.L.\u2019s name, Parker \u201cintervene[d]\u201d to keep Clark from\nfollowing A.L. into the store. Parker acknowledged that she\ninitiated a \u201cphysical confrontation\u201d with Clark by pushing or\nslapping her.\n   According to Parker, during that confrontation, Clark got\nback in the truck and \u201cstart[ed] rummaging through [it].\n\f                                   - 740 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] In reviewing a criminal conviction for a sufficiency of\nthe evidence claim, whether the evidence is direct, circum-\nstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the same: An\nappellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass\non the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence, and\nsuch matters are for the finder of fact. 3 The relevant question\nfor an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. 4\n   [2,3] Whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nmay be determined on direct appeal is a question of law. 5 In\nreviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct\nappeal, an appellate court decides only whether the undisputed\nfacts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively\ndetermine whether counsel did or did not provide effective\nassistance and whether the defendant was or was not preju-\ndiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. 6\n                        V. ANALYSIS\n               1. Trial Before All-Male Jury\n   Clark argues that she was deprived of her rights under the\n6th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution to a fair\ntrial and an impartial jury because she was tried before an\nall-male jury.

Nor does she dis-\npute that her trial counsel failed to challenge the jurors for\ndisqualification at the trial and passed the jurors for cause. To\nthe contrary, Clark alleges that her trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive for failing to object to the all-male jury. Accordingly, we\nagree with the State that Clark waived any objection to the\nall-male jury.

Sufficiency of Evidence as\n                     to Terroristic Threats\n  Clark also argues that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport her conviction for terroristic threats. In particular,\nshe argues that there was \u201cno direct evidence that points to\n[her] intent to actually terrorize\u201d Parker and that her words\nand actions and the surrounding circumstances fail to show\nsuch intent. 16 The State, on the other hand, argues that during\n13\n   State v.

In other words,\nthe crime proscribed by \u00a7 28-311.01 does not require an intent\nto execute the threats made; rather, it requires the intent to\nterrorize another as a result of the threats or a reckless dis-\nregard of the risk of causing terror to another. 18 In turn, for\npurposes of the crime of terroristic threats, the intent to ter-\nrorize another is an intent to produce intense fear or anxiety\nin another. 19 The intent with which an act is committed is a\nmental process and may be inferred from the words and acts\nof the defendant and from the circumstances surrounding\nthe incident. 20\n   In the present case, there was uncontroverted testimony\nfrom Parker that she and Clark were involved in a \u201cphysical\nconfrontation\u201d and that in the course of that confrontation,\nClark threatened to have her \u201cbeat[en] . . . up\u201d by various\npersons before grabbing a box cutter and saying, \u201c[B]itch I\u2019m\ngoing to kill you.\u201d Parker also testified that she was \u201ccon-\ncerned for [her] safety\u201d and backed away from Clark.

The State, in turn, argues that trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance was not deficient and that Clark cannot show\nthat she was prejudiced thereby.\n   Clark likens her situation to that of the defendant in Taylor\nv. Louisiana. 39 In Taylor, a state law barred women from\nbeing selected for jury service unless they had previously\nfiled a written declaration of their desire to be subject to jury\nservice. 40 As a result, even though women represented 53 per-\ncent of the citizens eligible for jury service in the defendant\u2019s\njudicial district, there were no females on the 175-person\nvenire drawn for jury service in his case. 41 The defendant\nchallenged his conviction by an all-male jury, arguing that\nthe all-male jury violated his 6th and 14th Amendment right\nto an impartial jury trial. 42 The U.S. Supreme Court agreed. 43\nThe Court reasoned that the selection of a petit jury from a\n\u201crepresentative cross section of the community is an essential\ncomponent of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d 44 and\nthat this fair-cross-section requirement was violated by the\n\u201csystematic exclusion of women\u201d from the jury in the defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s case. 45\n38\n   Brief for appellant at 16.\n39\n   Taylor, supra note 7.\n40\n   Id.\n41\n   Id.\n42\n   Id.\n43\n   Id.\n44\n   Id., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\">419 U.S. at 528</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n45\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\">Id.,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\">419 U.S. at 531</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\f                                    - 749 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    315 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE V.

The State used 9 of its 10 peremp-\ntory challenges to remove males. 47 As a result, the State\u2019s case\nseeking to establish the petitioner\u2019s paternity and obligate him\nto pay child support was tried before an all-female jury. 48\n   Clark argues that even though the all-male jury in her case\nwas not due to a rule excluding women, \u201cthe result was the\nsame\u201d as in Taylor and J. E. B. 49 She also argues that the same\n\u201cconcerns brought up in Taylor [and J. E. B.] are present\u201d in\nher case. 50 Clark maintains that even if the all-male jury in her\ncase did not result from any \u201cpurposeful gender exclusion,\u201d\nit nonetheless deprived her of her right to a jury of her peers,\nand that the denial of that right warrants the reversal of her\nconvictions. 51 Clark similarly maintains that the statement in\nTaylor that while petit juries must be drawn from a source\nfairly representative of the community, \u201c\u2018[d]efendants are not\nentitled to a jury of any particular composition,\u2019\u201d 52 pertains\nonly to the relative number of males and females on the jury.\nIn Clark\u2019s view, the situation is different where there is the\n\u201ccomplete lack of a gender group.\u201d 53\n   [10,11] We have followed the principles set forth in Taylor,\nJ.

Specifically, to establish a prima facie\nviolation of the fair-cross-section requirement under the Sixth\nAmendment, a defendant must show that the underrepresenta-\ntion of the group alleged to be excluded is due to systematic\nexclusion of the group in the jury selection process, among\nother things. 56 Similarly, in order to show that a prosecutor\nhas used peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner\nin violation of the 14th Amendment, a defendant must first\nmake a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised\nperemptory challenges on the basis of gender. 57\n   Clark does not point to any evidence that women were\nsystematically excluded during the jury selection process to\nwhich her trial counsel failed to object. Nor does Clark point\nto any evidence that the prosecutor exercised peremptory chal-\nlenges on the basis of gender to which her trial counsel failed\nto object. Instead, Clark invites us to presume that \u201csome-\nthing did not happen as it should have during jury selection\u201d\nfrom the fact that the jurors selected were all male. 58 Like\n54\n   See, e.g., State v.

Masters. 71 In Masters, we\nfound that testimony that the defendant \u201c\u2018had some type of\nconnection with drugs\u2019\u201d was so prejudicial that it required\nthe reversal of his conviction. 72 We emphasized, however, that\nthis outcome reflected the \u201cfactual context\u201d of that case. 73\n   [14] The present factual context is different.

A motion in limine is a procedural\nstep to prevent prejudicial evidence from reaching the jury. 76 It\nis not the office of a motion in limine to obtain a final ruling\nupon the ultimate admissibility of the evidence. 77 Therefore,\nwhen a court overrules a motion in limine to exclude par-\nticular evidence, the movant must object when the particular\nevidence is offered at trial in order to predicate error before an\nappellate court. 78 Here, however, Clark acknowledges that her\ntrial counsel did not object to Parker\u2019s testimony about Clark\u2019s\nalleged inquiry about drugs.\n   Accordingly, Clark cannot show that she suffered prejudice\nas a result of her trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion in\nlimine, because a motion in limine in and of itself, without\nany objection at trial, would have been futile, and Clark did\nnot assign that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nobject to the statement at trial. 79\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   Clark\u2019s claims that the all-male jury violated her constitu-\ntional rights, that there was insufficient evidence to support\nher conviction for terroristic threats, and that her trial counsel\nwas ineffective in multiple regards are without merit. As a\nresult, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                     Affirmed.\n76\n   Vaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9392520\"><a href=\"/opinion/9397044/state-v-vaughn/\">supra note 64</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n77\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9392520\"><a href=\"/opinion/9397044/state-v-vaughn/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n78\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9392520\"><a href=\"/opinion/9397044/state-v-vaughn/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n79\n   See, e.g., State v.

Horne was\naccepted into a problem-solving court program. On several\noccasions during Horne\u2019s participation in the program, the\ndistrict court sanctioned Horne for his failure to comply with\nprogram requirements. Eventually, the State moved to remove\nHorne from the program due to additional failures to follow\nprogram requirements. Horne admitted to the alleged viola-\ntions, and the district court removed Horne from the program.\nThe district court then sentenced Horne to a term of imprison-\nment on the charge to which he had earlier pled guilty. Horne\nappeals, challenging his removal from the problem-solving\ncourt program, the fact that the district court did not order\na presentence investigation before sentencing him, and the\nlength of his sentence. We find no reversible error and there-\nfore affirm.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\nHorne\u2019s Guilty Plea; Entry Into\nWellness Court Program.\n   This case began when the State charged Horne with pos-\nsession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The charges arose\nfrom an incident in which Horne appeared on a video holding\na gun and making comments about killing himself.\n   Horne and the State later reached a plea agreement. Pursuant\nto the agreement, Horne pled guilty to an amended charge of\nattempted possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and\nthe State recommended that Horne be admitted to \u201cWellness\nCourt,\u201d a problem-solving court program administered by the\ndistrict court. In such programs, sentencing is deferred fol-\nlowing a guilty plea and the defendant instead participates in\na program that includes treatment, supervision, and judicial\noversight. See State v. Shambley, 281 Neb. 317, 795 N.W.2d\n884 (2011). See, also, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-1302 (Reissue\n2016) (amended by 2023 Neb.

(rev. 2022).\nAfter successful completion of the program, participants are\noften permitted to withdraw their pleas and have their charges\ndismissed. See Shambley, supra. If, however, the participant\nis removed from the program or withdraws before success-\nful completion, the conviction stands and the case proceeds\nto sentencing on that conviction. See id. The district court\u2019s\nwellness court program is designed to assist defendants with\nmental health diagnoses.\n   The district court accepted Horne\u2019s guilty plea. It then con-\nfirmed on the record that Horne had read and reviewed with his\nattorney a contract governing the terms of his participation in\nthe wellness court program. The district court also confirmed\nthat Horne agreed to adhere to the requirements of the con-\ntract and that he understood that a failure to do so could result\nin removal from the program. The district court additionally\nadvised Horne that if he was removed from the program, he\ncould be sentenced on the charge to which he had pled guilty.\nThe district court accepted Horne into the wellness court pro-\ngram and released him on a signature bond. The full contract\ngoverning Horne\u2019s participation in the wellness court program\nis not included in the record on appeal.\n   In a journal entry and order memorializing the hearing at\nwhich Horne pled guilty and was accepted into the wellness\ncourt program, the district court stated that Horne had volun-\ntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to a pre-\nsentence investigation.\n\nWellness Court Program.\n   Horne began participating in the wellness court program\nshortly after the district court accepted him into the program\nin April 2021. As part of the wellness court program, Horne\nhad frequent status hearings in the district court. During those\nhearings, Horne reported on his weekly schedule, his progress\ntoward certain personal goals, and his meetings with proba-\ntion officers and therapists. During several of those status\n\f                               - 769 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE V.

When Horne failed to move into a\nstructured living facility despite program staff notifying him\nof an opening, the district court ordered Horne to move into\nthe facility or, if the space was no longer available, to report to\nthe county jail for a 1-day jail sanction. The record indicates\nthat Horne failed to report as ordered, and the district court\nordered a jail sanction.\n   As a result of Horne\u2019s failure to follow directions of the\ndistrict court, the district court eventually ordered Horne to\nremain in the county jail until a bed became available at a resi-\ndential treatment facility. When a bed became available, Horne\nwas released to the facility, but was ordered to immediately\nreport to the county jail if he failed to successfully complete\ntreatment. Horne left the treatment facility without success-\nfully completing treatment and failed to report to jail. Horne\nlater failed to appear at a status hearing, and the district court\nissued a warrant for his arrest. Horne was arrested and again\nplaced in the county jail.\n   Horne was subsequently placed in another treatment facil-\nity and ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device at all times.\nAfter Horne was unsuccessfully discharged from this treat-\nment facility, the State filed a motion in October 2022 seeking\nHorne\u2019s termination from the wellness court program. In the\nmotion, the State alleged multiple violations of Horne\u2019s well-\nness court program contract. The motion alleged that Horne\nhad failed to appear for a wellness court program hearing;\nthat he had tested positive for marijuana while at his latest\nresidential treatment facility, but denied using; that he had\n\f                              - 770 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nremoved his GPS monitoring device; and that he had failed to\nreport directly to the county jail as required after his unsuc-\ncessful discharge from the treatment facility. A warrant was\nagain issued for Horne\u2019s arrest, and he was arrested.\nRemoval From Wellness Court\nProgram and Sentencing.\n   At a hearing on the motion to terminate Horne from the\nwellness court program, Horne admitted to the allegations in\nthe State\u2019s motion. After accepting Horne\u2019s admissions, the\ndistrict court set another hearing for \u201cdisposition.\u201d\n   The district court began the subsequent hearing by asking\nHorne\u2019s counsel if there was \u201cany legal reason why we can\u2019t\nproceed to disposition.\u201d Horne\u2019s counsel said there was no\nsuch reason. The district court then stated that \u201calthough a\npresentence investigation report was not completed,\u201d it would\ntake judicial notice of the State\u2019s motion to remove Horne\nfrom the wellness court program and would receive as exhibits\nthe affidavit of probable cause for Horne\u2019s initial arrest, as\nwell as a document summarizing Horne\u2019s criminal history.\n    Horne\u2019s counsel, when given the opportunity to address\nthe district court, acknowledged that Horne \u201cattempted to\nparticipate\u201d in the wellness court program but \u201cdid so with\nnot a whole lot of success.\u201d He argued that Horne should be\npermitted to remain in the wellness court program or should\nbe sentenced to a term of probation on the charge to which\nhe pled.\n   The district court declined to allow Horne to remain in the\nwellness court program. On the charge to which Horne pled\nguilty, the district court sentenced him to 6 to 20 years\u2019 impris-\nonment with credit for time he had already served.\n   Horne timely appealed, and we moved the case to our\ndocket.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Horne assigns three errors. We have paraphrased those\nerrors as follows: the district court erred by (1) removing him\n\f                                - 771 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE V. HORNE\n                          Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nfrom the wellness court program, (2) sentencing him without\nfirst ordering a presentence investigation, and (3) imposing an\nexcessive sentence.\n                    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] We have not previously addressed the standard of\nreview that applies to a defendant\u2019s challenge to removal\nfrom a problem-solving court program. The Nebraska Court of\nAppeals has held that a defendant\u2019s removal from a problem-\nsolving court program is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\nSee State v. Seaman, 28 Neb. App. 667, 947 N.W.2d 589\n(2020). We agree. Deciding whether to remove a defendant\nfrom a problem-solving court program is much like decid-\ning whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation or choosing a\nsentence within the prescribed statutory range. Each depends\nupon a trial court\u2019s \u201cunique familiarity with the facts and cir-\ncumstances of a case and its judgment in balancing a host of\nincommensurate and disparate considerations.\u201d U.S. v. Ruiz-\nTerrazas, 477 F.3d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 2007). We review a\ndecision to revoke probation, and a sentence imposed within\nstatutory limits, for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., State v. Ezell,\n314 Neb. 825, 993 N.W.2d 449 (2023) (sentencing); State v.\nJohnson, 287 Neb. 190, 842 N.W.2d 63 (2014) (revocation of\nprobation). We believe it appropriate to apply the same stan-\ndard to a termination from a problem-solving court.\n   [2,3] A sentence imposed within statutory limits will not\nbe disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court. State v. Alkazahy, 314 Neb. 406, 990\nN.W.2d 740 (2023). An abuse of discretion takes place when\nthe sentencing court\u2019s reasons or rulings are clearly untenable\nand unfairly deprive a litigant of a substantial right and a just\nresult. Id.\n                        ANALYSIS\nRemoval From Wellness Court Program.\n  Horne argues that the district court erred by removing\nhim from the wellness court program. Horne primarily argues\n\f                              - 772 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nthat the conduct underlying his conviction supports continued\nparticipation in the wellness court program rather than a term\nof incarceration. While he admits to \u201csome struggles\u201d with the\nwellness court program, he argues he has attempted to fulfill\nits requirements and the district court should have allowed him\nto remain in the program. Brief for appellant at 21.\n   Saying that Horne\u2019s had \u201csome struggles\u201d in the well-\nness court program is an understatement. As detailed above,\nHorne violated requirements of the wellness court repeat-\nedly. He missed drug tests; he was dishonest with probation\nofficers; he failed to complete ordered community service;\nhe missed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; he did not report\nto a structured living facility as ordered; he spent time in the\ncounty jail as a result of sanctions; he failed to successfully\ncomplete multiple residential treatment programs; he failed\nto report to jail as ordered after leaving a treatment program;\nhe tested positive for marijuana, and then he denied using\nwhile at a residential treatment program; he removed his\ncourt-ordered GPS monitoring device. On several occasions,\nthe district court reminded Horne of the need to follow the\nprogram\u2019s requirements. Furthermore, the district court made\nclear to Horne when he entered the program that he could be\nremoved from the program if he failed to comply with the pro-\ngram\u2019s requirements.\n   Horne\u2019s argument in this case appears to be that he deserves\none more chance to comply with the requirements of the well-\nness court program. In particular, he points to a residential\ntreatment program he has not yet entered and argues he\nshould be allowed to remain in the wellness court program\nand be placed there. We must keep in mind, however, our\nabuse of discretion standard of review. A judicial abuse of\ndiscretion exists only when the reasons or rulings of a trial\njudge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a\nsubstantial right and denying a just result in matters submitted\nfor disposition. State v. Ramirez, 314 Neb. 419, 990 N.W.2d\n550 (2023). In applying that standard of review here, we\n\f                              - 773 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nare particularly hesitant to second-guess the district court\u2019s\ndecision to remove Horne from the wellness court program,\nin light of the substantial firsthand knowledge of Horne it\nhad through his participation in the program. Given Horne\u2019s\nmultiple failures to comply with the requirements of the well-\nness court program and the district court\u2019s familiarity with\nHorne, we cannot say the district court\u2019s decision in this case\nconcluding \u201cenough was enough\u201d was untenable. We thus\nconclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nremoving Horne from the wellness court program.\nLack of Presentence Investigation Report.\n   Horne next argues that the district court erred by imposing a\nsentence without first ordering a presentence investigation. He\nargues such an investigation was required by Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 29-2261(1) (Cum. Supp. 2022). That subsection provides, in\nrelevant part, as follows:\n      Unless it is impractical to do so, when an offender has\n      been convicted of a felony other than murder in the\n      first degree, the court shall not impose sentence without\n      first ordering a presentence investigation of the offender\n      and according due consideration to a written report of\n      such investigation.\n   Horne argues that decisions of this court have established\nthat it is mandatory for a district court to consider a pre-\nsentence investigation report in sentencing unless such an\ninvestigation would be impractical or the record demonstrates\nthe defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of a\npresentence investigation. Horne claims that an investigation\nwould not have been impractical here and that the record\ndoes not show that he knowingly and intelligently waived a\npresentence investigation. The State counters by arguing that,\nunder the circumstances, an investigation was impractical and\nthat Horne knowingly and intelligently waived his right to\nan investigation.\n   [4] Before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments, we address\nanother issue: the fact that Horne made no objection to the\n\f                              - 774 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nsentence being imposed without a presentence investiga-\ntion, even after the district court announced on the record\nthat \u201ca presentence investigation report was not completed.\u201d\nGenerally speaking, we will not review an issue for prejudi-\ncial error if the party fails to make a timely objection in the\ncourt below. See State v. Childs, 309 Neb. 427, 960 N.W.2d\n585 (2021). Under most circumstances, we require a party to\nobject to a perceived error by a trial court in order to preserve\nthat issue for appeal. State v. McSwine, 292 Neb. 565, 873\nN.W.2d 405 (2016). As we have occasionally articulated the\nprinciple, \u201c[o]ne cannot silently tolerate error, gamble on a\nfavorable result, and then complain that one guessed wrong.\u201d\nIn re Interest of Samantha L., 286 Neb. 778, 787, 839 N.W.2d\n265, 272 (2013). See, also, State v. Kruse, 303 Neb. 799, 808,\n931 N.W.2d 148, 155 (2019) (\u201c[a]s a general rule, an appellate\ncourt will not consider an argument or theory that is raised for\nthe first time on appeal\u201d). Usually, when a party fails to object\nto an alleged error by the trial court, we will, at most, review\nthe issue for plain error. See McSwine, supra. See, also, State\nv. Roth, 311 Neb. 1007, 1014, 977 N.W.2d 221, 228 (2022)\n(\u201c[c]onsideration of plain error occurs at the discretion of an\nappellate court\u201d).\n   Our rule limiting appellate review when an issue was\nnot brought to the attention of the trial court serves impor-\ntant purposes. As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained,\nrules circumscribing review in the absence of a trial court\nobjection \u201cencourage all trial participants to seek a fair and\naccurate [proceeding] the first time around.\u201d United States\nv. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1\n(1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way,\nrules limiting appellate review in the absence of a trial court\nobjection incentivize trial court objections \u201cso that any errors\ncan be corrected before their full impact is realized.\u201d State\nv. Pearson, 775 N.W.2d 155, 161 (Minn. 2009). At the same\ntime, appellate courts\u2019 limited discretion to recognize plain\nerror even in the absence of a lower court objection serves\n\f                              - 775 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nas a backstop to potential injustice. See Hormel v. Helvering,\n312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S. Ct. 719, 85 L. Ed. 1037 (1941) (\u201c[a]\nrigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which\ncourts of review would invariably and under all circumstances\ndecline to consider all questions which had not previously\nbeen specifically urged would be out of harmony with . . .\nrules of fundamental justice\u201d).\n   Horne cannot dispute that it would be consistent with our\nrules regarding trial court objections, as well as the purposes\nthose rules serve, to limit our review on this assignment of\nerror to whether the district court plainly erred by not order-\ning a presentence investigation. We anticipate, however, that\nHorne would contend that precedent in prior cases involving\n\u00a7 29-2261(1) establishes that we should not limit our review\nin this manner. As we will explain, we disagree.\n   In a line of prior cases, this court has explored whether\nand under what circumstances a defendant can waive an argu-\nment that a trial court erred by not completing a presentence\ninvestigation contemplated by \u00a7 29-2261(1). That line of cases\nbegins with State v. Hiross, 211 Neb. 319, 318 N.W.2d 291\n(1982). In that case, the trial court informed the defendant that\nit was willing to order a presentence investigation in a mis-\ndemeanor case, but the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the court\nthat the defendant did not want a presentence investigation\nand desired to waive the trial court\u2019s offer to obtain one. When\nthe defend\u00adant subsequently argued on appeal that the trial\ncourt erred by not ordering a presentence investigation, this\ncourt concluded that the defendant had \u201cwaived the court\u2019s\noffer\u201d of a presentence investigation and was thus \u201cnot now in\na position to claim error.\u201d Id. at 320, 318 N.W.2d at 292.\n   A few years later in State v. Tolbert, 223 Neb. 794, 394\nN.W.2d 288 (1986), both the defendant and her counsel\ninformed the trial court that they wished to waive the presen-\ntence investigation. After the trial court imposed a sentence\nwithout completing a presentence investigation, however, the\ndefendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred by\n\f                              - 776 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nnot ordering a presentence investigation. Although this court\nultimately held that the trial court was not required to order\na presentence investigation because doing so would have\nbeen impractical, we, citing Hiross, supra, also noted that a\ndefend\u00adant can waive an objection to a trial court\u2019s decision\nnot to order a presentence investigation.\n   Over two decades later in State v. Qualls, 284 Neb. 929,\n824 N.W.2d 362 (2012), we were confronted with yet another\ncase in which the defendant informed the trial court that he\ndesired to waive a presentence investigation and the trial\ncourt proceeded to impose a sentence without ordering one. In\nQualls, the defendant later argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred by failing to adequately advise him that he was entitled\nto have a presentence investigation completed and for the trial\ncourt to consider the report of that investigation in crafting a\nsentence. In our opinion, we noted that \u00a7 29-2261(1) generally\nmakes presentence investigations mandatory in felony cases,\nbut citing Tolbert, supra, we noted that we had held that a\ndefendant can waive a presentence investigation. We observed\nthat while we had held that an otherwise mandatory presen-\ntence investigation can be waived, we had not previously\naddressed how such a waiver could be effectuated. Relying\non general propositions regarding waiver and the standards by\nwhich defendants may waive constitutional rights to counsel\nand to be present at trial, we ultimately held that a defendant\ncan waive a presentence investigation under \u00a7 29-2261(1) if\n\u201cit is apparent from the record that the defendant\u2019s relinquish-\nment of the right was knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d\nQualls, 284 Neb. at 933, 824 N.W.2d at 365. We later applied\nthis standard to find that a defendant waived a presentence\ninvestigation in State v. Iddings, 304 Neb. 759, 936 N.W.2d\n747 (2020).\n   We do not understand the line of cases we have just dis-\ncussed as exempting defendants who raise an argument\nbased on \u00a7 29-2261(1) from our usual rule requiring a timely\nobjection in the trial court to preserve an issue for full\n\f                              - 777 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\nappellate review. Those cases addressed whether and how a\ndefendant can effectuate a waiver of a presentence investiga-\ntion. But our rule limiting review without a timely objection\nin the trial court is not, strictly speaking, a waiver rule, but,\nrather, a rule of forfeiture.\n   As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[w]aiver is\ndifferent from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure to\nmake the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the inten-\ntional relinquishment . . . of a known right.\u201d United States v.\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). See, also, Freytag\nv. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 894 n.2, 111 S. Ct. 2631,\n115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring) (observing\nthat waiver and forfeiture are \u201creally not the same\u201d); U.S. v.\nStaples, 202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[w]here waiver\nis accomplished by intent, forfeiture comes about through\nneglect\u201d). We acknowledge that this court, like many others,\nhas not always used these terms precisely. Compare, e.g., State\nv. Collins, 281 Neb. 927, 799 N.W.2d 693 (2011) (discuss-\ning cases in which failures to assert objections were found to\nwaive objections), with State v. Kennedy, 224 Neb. 164, 170,\n396 N.W.2d 722, 726 (1986) (\u201c[a] waiver is the voluntary\nand intentional relinquishment of a known right, privilege, or\nclaim\u201d). See, also, Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of\nChicago, 583 U.S. 17, 20 n.1, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d\n249 (2017) (\u201c[t]he terms waiver and forfeiture\u2014though often\nused interchangeably by jurists and litigants\u2014are not synony-\nmous\u201d); Freytag, supra (Scalia, J., concurring); U.S. v. Noble,\n762 F.3d 509, 528 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that courts have\nused the terms \u201crather loosely\u201d). Despite occasional linguis-\ntic imprecision in discussing waiver and forfeiture, there are\nmeaningful distinctions between the concepts. See Noble, 762\nF.3d at 528 (waiver and forfeiture have \u201cdifferent meanings\nand difference consequences\u201d).\n   One of the ways in which the distinction between waiver\nand forfeiture is meaningful is that when a party truly and\n\f                              - 778 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\neffectively waives a right, there can be no error in failing\nto honor that right and no appellate review is available. See\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 733 (\u201c[b]ecause the right to trial is waiv-\nable, and because the defendant who enters a valid guilty\nplea waives that right, his conviction without a trial is not\n\u2018error\u2019\u201d); Staples, 202 F.3d at 995 (\u201c[w]aiver extinguishes\nthe error and precludes appellate review\u201d). The same is not\nnecessarily true for forfeiture. In Nebraska, as in the federal\nsystem, a party can forfeit an argument by failing to timely\nassert it, yet there is still the possibility that a court could\nfind that the trial court committed error on plain error review.\nSee, Olano, supra; State v. Roth, 311 Neb. 1007, 977 N.W.2d\n221 (2022). Thus, by addressing waiver in State v. Qualls,\n284 Neb. 929, 824 N.W.2d 362 (2021), we were determining\nwhat a defendant must do to completely give up any right to\ncontend on appeal that the trial court erred by not ordering a\npresentence investigation. We did not address in Qualls how\na defendant might, by failing to object to the lack of a presen-\ntence investigation, forfeit the right to full appellate review\nof that issue.\n   We are aware that some rights (such as the constitutional\nrights to counsel and trial by jury) can be waived, but can-\nnot be given up through mere forfeiture. See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d\n764 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). See, also, Olano, 507 U.S.\nat 733 (explaining that whether right is waivable and how\nright can be waived \u201cdepend on the right at stake\u201d); State\nv.

Many other rights, however, including many\nof constitutional origin, are subject to forfeiture if not timely\nasserted. See, Freytag, supra (Scalia, J., concurring); Collins,\nsupra. Although we do not mean to diminish the importance of\na trial court\u2019s consideration of information available through\na presentence investigation, we are not persuaded that the\nmandate of \u00a7 29-2261(1) is comparable to the constitutional\n\f                              - 779 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V.

We have said\nthat plain error may be found on appeal when an error unas-\nserted or uncomplained of at trial, but plainly evident from the\nrecord, prejudicially affects a litigant\u2019s substantial right and,\nif uncorrected, would result in damage to the integrity, repu-\ntation, and fairness of the judicial process.

We have additionally\nobserved that plain error \u201cis not a vehicle that should be rou-\ntinely used to \u2018save\u2019 an issue for appeal where a proper objec-\ntion should have been, but was not, made at trial.\u201d Id. at 583,\n873 N.W.2d at 418.\n   Even assuming for the sake of argument that Horne could\nshow that it is plainly evident from the record that the district\ncourt should have ordered a presentence investigation, we\ndecline to find plain error here. We initially note that there is\nsome indication in the record that Horne did, in fact, waive\na presentence investigation. As mentioned above, the district\ncourt stated in a journal entry made at the time of Horne\u2019s plea\nthat he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived\nhis right to a presentence investigation. And although the\nverbatim transcript of the plea hearing does not include any\ndiscussion of a presentence investigation, at oral argument,\nHorne\u2019s counsel acknowledged the possibility that a waiver of\na presentence investigation was a standard term in the wellness\ncourt program contract that Horne signed but is not a part of\nthe record on appeal.\n\f                              - 780 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V. HORNE\n                        Cite as 315 Neb. 766\n\n   More importantly, this is not a case in which the district\ncourt lacked critical information about a defendant at sentenc-\ning. As part of the wellness court program, the district court\nhad the opportunity to observe Horne and regularly commu-\nnicate with him about subjects such as his family, his employ-\nment, and his treatment from his entry in the program in April\n2021 until the State filed its motion to remove him from the\nprogram in January 2023. Furthermore, if there was additional\ninformation that Horne felt was relevant to the district court\u2019s\nsentencing decision, we see no reason why Horne could not\nhave offered that information prior to sentencing. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot say that it would result in damage\nto the integrity, reputation, and fairness of the judicial process\nif we allowed Horne\u2019s sentence to stand despite the lack of a\npresentence investigation. See McSwine, supra.\nExcessive Sentence.\n   Horne\u2019s final argument is that the district court imposed an\nexcessive sentence. He does not dispute that his sentence was\nwithin statutory limits, but asserts that the district court none-\ntheless abused its discretion in fashioning a sentence.\n   We have on numerous occasions set forth the various fac-\ntors that a sentencing judge is to consider. See, e.g., State v.\nThomas, 311 Neb. 989, 977 N.W.2d 258 (2022). Horne argues\nthat in his case, those factors weighed in favor of a sentence of\nprobation rather than incarceration if Horne was not allowed\nto continue in the wellness court program. Mindful that it is\nnot our function to conduct a de novo review of the record to\ndetermine what sentence we would impose, see State v. Pauly,\n311 Neb. 418, 972 N.W.2d 907 (2022), we find that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Horne.\n                        CONCLUSION\n   Because we find no reversible error on the part of the dis-\ntrict court, we affirm.\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">Nebraska Supreme Court Online Library\nwww.nebraska.gov/apps-courts-epub/\n01/19/2024 09:08 AM CST\n\n\n\n\n                                                         - 766 -\n                               Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                                        315 Nebraska Reports\n                                                   STATE V.

Horne was\naccepted into a problem-solving court program. On several\noccasions during Horne\u2019s participation in the program, the\ndistrict court sanctioned Horne for his failure to comply with\nprogram requirements. Eventually, the State moved to remove\nHorne from the program due to additional failures to follow\nprogram requirements. Horne admitted to the alleged viola-\ntions, and the district court removed Horne from the program.\nThe district court then sentenced Horne to a term of imprison-\nment on the charge to which he had earlier pled guilty. Horne\nappeals, challenging his removal from the problem-solving\ncourt program, the fact that the district court did not order\na presentence investigation before sentencing him, and the\nlength of his sentence.

The charges arose\nfrom an incident in which Horne appeared on a video holding\na gun and making comments about killing himself.\n   Horne and the State later reached a plea agreement. Pursuant\nto the agreement, Horne pled guilty to an amended charge of\nattempted possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and\nthe State recommended that Horne be admitted to \u201cWellness\nCourt,\u201d a problem-solving court program administered by the\ndistrict court. In such programs, sentencing is deferred fol-\nlowing a guilty plea and the defendant instead participates in\na program that includes treatment, supervision, and judicial\noversight. See State v.

The district court\u2019s\nwellness court program is designed to assist defendants with\nmental health diagnoses.\n   The district court accepted Horne\u2019s guilty plea. It then con-\nfirmed on the record that Horne had read and reviewed with his\nattorney a contract governing the terms of his participation in\nthe wellness court program. The district court also confirmed\nthat Horne agreed to adhere to the requirements of the con-\ntract and that he understood that a failure to do so could result\nin removal from the program. The district court additionally\nadvised Horne that if he was removed from the program, he\ncould be sentenced on the charge to which he had pled guilty.\nThe district court accepted Horne into the wellness court pro-\ngram and released him on a signature bond.

As part of the wellness court program, Horne\nhad frequent status hearings in the district court.

When Horne failed to move into a\nstructured living facility despite program staff notifying him\nof an opening, the district court ordered Horne to move into\nthe facility or, if the space was no longer available, to report to\nthe county jail for a 1-day jail sanction. The record indicates\nthat Horne failed to report as ordered, and the district court\nordered a jail sanction.\n   As a result of Horne\u2019s failure to follow directions of the\ndistrict court, the district court eventually ordered Horne to\nremain in the county jail until a bed became available at a resi-\ndential treatment facility. When a bed became available, Horne\nwas released to the facility, but was ordered to immediately\nreport to the county jail if he failed to successfully complete\ntreatment. Horne left the treatment facility without success-\nfully completing treatment and failed to report to jail. Horne\nlater failed to appear at a status hearing, and the district court\nissued a warrant for his arrest. Horne was arrested and again\nplaced in the county jail.\n   Horne was subsequently placed in another treatment facil-\nity and ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device at all times.\nAfter Horne was unsuccessfully discharged from this treat-\nment facility, the State filed a motion in October 2022 seeking\nHorne\u2019s termination from the wellness court program. In the\nmotion, the State alleged multiple violations of Horne\u2019s well-\nness court program contract. The motion alleged that Horne\nhad failed to appear for a wellness court program hearing;\nthat he had tested positive for marijuana while at his latest\nresidential treatment facility, but denied using; that he had\n\f                              - 770 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V.

After accepting Horne\u2019s admissions, the\ndistrict court set another hearing for \u201cdisposition.\u201d\n   The district court began the subsequent hearing by asking\nHorne\u2019s counsel if there was \u201cany legal reason why we can\u2019t\nproceed to disposition.\u201d Horne\u2019s counsel said there was no\nsuch reason. The district court then stated that \u201calthough a\npresentence investigation report was not completed,\u201d it would\ntake judicial notice of the State\u2019s motion to remove Horne\nfrom the wellness court program and would receive as exhibits\nthe affidavit of probable cause for Horne\u2019s initial arrest, as\nwell as a document summarizing Horne\u2019s criminal history.\n    Horne\u2019s counsel, when given the opportunity to address\nthe district court, acknowledged that Horne \u201cattempted to\nparticipate\u201d in the wellness court program but \u201cdid so with\nnot a whole lot of success.\u201d He argued that Horne should be\npermitted to remain in the wellness court program or should\nbe sentenced to a term of probation on the charge to which\nhe pled.\n   The district court declined to allow Horne to remain in the\nwellness court program.

While he admits to \u201csome struggles\u201d with the\nwellness court program, he argues he has attempted to fulfill\nits requirements and the district court should have allowed him\nto remain in the program. Brief for appellant at 21.\n   Saying that Horne\u2019s had \u201csome struggles\u201d in the well-\nness court program is an understatement. As detailed above,\nHorne violated requirements of the wellness court repeat-\nedly. He missed drug tests; he was dishonest with probation\nofficers; he failed to complete ordered community service;\nhe missed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; he did not report\nto a structured living facility as ordered; he spent time in the\ncounty jail as a result of sanctions; he failed to successfully\ncomplete multiple residential treatment programs; he failed\nto report to jail as ordered after leaving a treatment program;\nhe tested positive for marijuana, and then he denied using\nwhile at a residential treatment program; he removed his\ncourt-ordered GPS monitoring device. On several occasions,\nthe district court reminded Horne of the need to follow the\nprogram\u2019s requirements. Furthermore, the district court made\nclear to Horne when he entered the program that he could be\nremoved from the program if he failed to comply with the pro-\ngram\u2019s requirements.\n   Horne\u2019s argument in this case appears to be that he deserves\none more chance to comply with the requirements of the well-\nness court program. In particular, he points to a residential\ntreatment program he has not yet entered and argues he\nshould be allowed to remain in the wellness court program\nand be placed there. We must keep in mind, however, our\nabuse of discretion standard of review. A judicial abuse of\ndiscretion exists only when the reasons or rulings of a trial\njudge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a\nsubstantial right and denying a just result in matters submitted\nfor disposition.

As mentioned above, the district\ncourt stated in a journal entry made at the time of Horne\u2019s plea\nthat he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived\nhis right to a presentence investigation. And although the\nverbatim transcript of the plea hearing does not include any\ndiscussion of a presentence investigation, at oral argument,\nHorne\u2019s counsel acknowledged the possibility that a waiver of\na presentence investigation was a standard term in the wellness\ncourt program contract that Horne signed but is not a part of\nthe record on appeal.\n\f                              - 780 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  315 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE V.

As part of the wellness court program, the district court\nhad the opportunity to observe Horne and regularly commu-\nnicate with him about subjects such as his family, his employ-\nment, and his treatment from his entry in the program in April\n2021 until the State filed its motion to remove him from the\nprogram in January 2023. Furthermore, if there was additional\ninformation that Horne felt was relevant to the district court\u2019s\nsentencing decision, we see no reason why Horne could not\nhave offered that information prior to sentencing. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot say that it would result in damage\nto the integrity, reputation, and fairness of the judicial process\nif we allowed Horne\u2019s sentence to stand despite the lack of a\npresentence investigation. See McSwine, supra.\nExcessive Sentence.\n   Horne\u2019s final argument is that the district court imposed an\nexcessive sentence. He does not dispute that his sentence was\nwithin statutory limits, but asserts that the district court none-\ntheless abused its discretion in fashioning a sentence.\n   We have on numerous occasions set forth the various fac-\ntors that a sentencing judge is to consider. See, e.g., State v.\nThomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6500255\"><a href=\"/opinion/6623897/state-v-thomas/\">311 Neb. 989</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">977 N.W.2d 258</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022). Horne argues\nthat in his case, those factors weighed in favor of a sentence of\nprobation rather than incarceration if Horne was not allowed\nto continue in the wellness court program.

Regardless of whether\n                    the evidence is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, and\n                    regardless of whether the issue is labeled as a failure to direct a verdict,\n                    insufficiency of the evidence, or failure to prove a prima facie case, the\n                    standard is the same: In reviewing a criminal conviction, an appellate\n                    court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass on the credibility\n                    of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence; such matters are for the finder\n                    of fact, and a conviction will be affirmed, in the absence of prejudicial\n                    error, if the evidence admitted at trial, viewed and construed most favor-\n                    ably to the State, is sufficient to support the conviction.\n                 6.

Sentences: Appeal and Error. Where a sentence imposed within the\n       statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court\n       must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in con-\n       sidering and applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal\n       principles in determining the sentence to be imposed.\n 9.    Criminal Law: Homicide: Evidence. To sustain a conviction for man-\n       slaughter, the evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\n       causal connection between the unlawful act and the death of the victim.\n10.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Prosecuting Attorneys: Proof. The same\n       conduct may constitute both unlawful act manslaughter and motor\n       vehicle homicide, and the State has the prosecutorial discretion to pur-\n       sue charges for either offense. But in exercising its discretion to charge\n       under one offense or another, the State must still prove each element of\n       that offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n11.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence. Contributory negligence is not\n       a defense to the charge of motor vehicle homicide. Rather, the issue is\n       whether a defendant\u2019s violation of the law was a contributing factor to\n       the death.\n12.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence: Proximate Cause. A victim\u2019s\n       negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a motor vehicle homi-\n       cide case unless the actions of the victim were the sole proximate cause\n       of the accident.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Lori\nA.

We affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   At approximately 9:25 p.m. on July 30, 2020, Tvrdy was\ntraveling eastbound in his Dodge Charger on what was then\nNebraska Highway 2 (now Nebraska Parkway) in Lincoln,\nNebraska. On this stretch of road, Highway 2 ran parallel\nto Pioneers Boulevard, which was accessed from the high-\nway via an access road. This access road then merged with\nPioneers Boulevard and continued eastbound. On this eve-\nning, Tvrdy sought to turn left across the westbound lanes\nof Highway 2 traffic. The intersection in question is not con-\ntrolled by a traffic light.\n   When Tvrdy approached the left turn, he slowed, waiting\nfor a car ahead of him to make the turn. Tvrdy then made the\nturn. While in the process of making the left turn, a motor-\ncycle operated by Brady Sweetser, traveling in the westbound\nlanes of Highway 2, collided with the passenger-side front\ndoor of Tvrdy\u2019s vehicle. Sweetser suffered blunt force trauma\nin the collision and died from his injuries. There was evidence\nat trial that Sweetser might have been speeding, including\ntestimony that a neighbor heard the throttling acceleration of\na motorcycle immediately prior to the sound of the collision,\nbut Sweetser\u2019s exact rate of speed was unknown.\n   Tvrdy was transported to a hospital with reports of head\npain. He also suffered several minor cuts and abrasions. Based\nupon the reports of law enforcement officials who responded\nto the scene of the collision, it was thought that Tvrdy might\nbe under the influence of some intoxicating substance. A\npreliminary breath test and other field sobriety tests were\nperformed. Following this drug investigation evaluation, the\nofficer conducting such tests concluded that it was her belief\nthat Tvrdy was under the influence of marijuana. A urine test\nlater showed the presence of \u201cTHC.\u201d\n\f                                - 759 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE V. TVRDY\n                          Cite as 315 Neb. 756\n\n   Tvrdy was initially charged with motor vehicle homicide\nwhile under the influence, a Class IIA felony. 1 The information\nagainst him was later amended to add a charge of unlawful\nact manslaughter, 2 with the unlawful act of driving under the\ninfluence, also a Class IIA felony. 3 The motor vehicle homicide\ncharge was dismissed prior to trial, and Tvrdy proceeded to\ntrial on only the manslaughter charge.\n   Following a jury trial, Tvrdy was found guilty of unlawful\nact manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 to 16 years\u2019 impris-\nonment. He appeals, and we moved this appeal to our docket.\n\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Tvrdy assigns that the district court erred in (1) using\njury instructions for motor vehicle homicide instead of man-\nslaughter, to Tvrdy\u2019s prejudice; (2) finding sufficient evidence\nto support Tvrdy\u2019s conviction; and (3) imposing an exces-\nsive sentence.\n\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1-4] Whether jury instructions are correct is a question of\nlaw, which an appellate court resolves independently of the\nlower court\u2019s decision. 4 In an appeal based upon a claim of\nan erroneous jury instruction, the appellant has the burden to\nshow that the questioned instruction was prejudicial or other-\nwise adversely affected a substantial right of the appellant. 5\nAll the jury instructions must be read together, and if, taken\nas a whole, they correctly state the law, are not misleading,\nand adequately cover the issues supported by the pleadings\nand the evidence, there is no prejudicial error necessitating\n1\n  See Neb.

According to statute, \u201cA\nperson commits manslaughter if he or she . . . causes the\ndeath of another unintentionally while in the commission of\nan unlawful act.\u201d 16 To sustain a conviction for manslaughter,\nthe evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\ncausal connection between the unlawful act and the death of\nthe victim. 17\n   [10] The same conduct may constitute both unlawful act\nmanslaughter and motor vehicle homicide, and the State\nhas the prosecutorial discretion to pursue charges for either\noffense. 18 But in exercising its discretion to charge under one\noffense or another, the State must still prove each element of\nthat offense beyond a reasonable doubt. 19\n   [11,12] It has been a longstanding principle that contribu-\ntory negligence is not a defense to the charge of motor vehicle\nhomicide. 20 Rather, the issue is whether a defendant\u2019s viola-\ntion of the law was a contributing factor to the death. 21 Thus,\na victim\u2019s negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a\nmotor vehicle homicide case unless the actions of the victim\nwere the sole proximate cause of the accident. 22 All the jury\ninstructions must be read together, and if, taken as a whole,\nthey correctly state the law, are not misleading, and adequately\ncover the issues supported by the pleadings and the evidence,\nthere is no prejudicial error necessitating reversal. 23\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the arguments\non appeal.

It instructed, as relevant, that the\nState must prove Tvrdy caused Sweetser\u2019s death, unintention-\nally and while in the commission of the unlawful act of driv-\ning under the influence. Instruction No. 3 concluded by noting\nthat \u201c[t]he burden of proof is always on the State to prove all\nof the material elements of the crime charged, and the burden\nnever shifts.\u201d We observe that this instruction is not challenged\non appeal.\n   Once again, we note instruction No. 5, which provides:\n           Under the law in Nebraska, the negligence of a victim\n        is not a defense to a prosecution for Manslaughter unless\n        such negligence is the sole proximate cause of the death.\n           Such negligence, if it exists, may be considered on the\n        issue of whether the conduct of [Tvrdy] was a proximate\n        cause of the death of [the victim].\nThis instruction is identical in substance to the instruction we\nset forth in State v. Brown, 24 wherein we suggested that the\nlanguage be used \u201cin such circumstances.\u201d\n   And although Brown involved a charge of motor vehicle\nhomicide, we disagree with Tvrdy\u2019s suggestion that while\nthe contributory negligence of the victim is not a defense\nto motor vehicle homicide, it is a defense to manslaugh-\nter. Contrary to Tvrdy, we do not read the Eighth Circuit\u2019s\nopinion in Schmidt to hold that contributory negligence is a\ndefense to manslaughter. 25 Instead, we read the Eighth Circuit\nto have said that evidence of a victim\u2019s negligence might\nbe relevant to whether the defendant proximately caused\nthe death at issue. In fact, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion, in\na footnote, expressly rejected the notion that contributory\nnegligence of the decedent was a defense to manslaugh-\nter. 26 Furthermore, ample authority suggests that contributory\n24\n   State v.

TVRDY\n                               Cite as 315 Neb. 756\n\nnegligence of the victim is never a defense to any criminal\ncharge. 27 Even if there might be some exception to the rule\nthat contributory negligence of the victim is not an available\ndefense in criminal cases, Tvrdy has not shown that it is a\ndefense to manslaughter.\n   We find no error in the giving of instruction No. 5. We\nagree that it was a correct statement of the law. We dis-\nagree with the assertion that the first sentence of instruction\nNo. 5 conflicts with the second sentence and that the jury\nwould have been confused about whether it could consider\nSweetser\u2019s own negligence. The first sentence simply notes\nthat this negligence would not be a defense to manslaughter,\nwhich is a correct statement of law. Moreover, this first sen-\ntence does not preclude the consideration of that evidence\u2014in\nfact, it invites the jury to do so when determining causation.\nThe second sentence makes it even more plain that the jury\nmay consider that evidence to determine causation.\n   When read with instruction No. 3, which was not chal-\nlenged, the instructions inform the jury that the State always\nretains the burden to prove the elements of unlawful act\nmanslaughter (as well as driving under the influence). These\nelements include causation, and the State must prove that\nTvrdy\u2019s actions, and not Sweetser\u2019s own negligence, were the\ncause of Sweetser\u2019s death.\n   An examination of the record shows that evidence of\nSweetser\u2019s possible acceleration\u2014both in the moments\nbefore the collision, as well as immediately preceding the\n27\n     See, People v. Tims, 499 Mich. 83, 98, 534 N.W.2d 675, 681 (1995)\n     (concluding that \u201c[i]t appears to be the universal rule\u201d that contributory\n     negligence is not defense in criminal cases); State v. Crace, 289 N.W.2d\n     54, 59 (Minn. 1979) (\u201c[i]t is well settled that the contributory negligence\n     of the victim is never a defense to criminal prosecution\u201d); State v.

The jury was also pro-\nvided evidence that over a multitude of different scenarios,\nbased on the evidence produced at trial, there was never\nenough time for Tvrdy to complete his left turn without caus-\ning Sweetser\u2014who had the right of way\u2014to collide with him.\nAnd while the evidence as to Tvrdy\u2019s intoxication was chal-\nlenged, there was sufficient evidence to support that finding.\nAs such, Tvrdy\u2019s first and second assignments of error are\nwithout merit.\nSentence.\n   In his final assignment of error, Tvrdy assigns that his sen-\ntence of 12 to 16 years\u2019 imprisonment was excessive. Tvrdy\ncontends that the court abused its discretion when it failed to\nconsider Tvrdy\u2019s willingness to change, involvement in pro-\nsocial activities, education, and positive relationships.\n   Unlawful act manslaughter is a Class IIA felony, which is\npunishable by up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. As such, Tvrdy\u2019s\nsentence was within statutory limits. Moreover, the presen-\ntence report shows that Tvrdy has a criminal history entailing\nboth multiple speeding and possession of marijuana offenses,\nas well as a driving under the influence offense. We find no\nabuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s sentence and no\nmerit to Tvrdy\u2019s third assignment of error.\n                       CONCLUSION\n  The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                    Affirmed.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">Nebraska Supreme Court Online Library\nwww.nebraska.gov/apps-courts-epub/\n01/19/2024 09:08 AM CST\n\n\n\n\n                                                         - 756 -\n                               Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                                        315 Nebraska Reports\n                                                   STATE V.

Jury Instructions: Appeal and Error. Whether jury instructions are\n                    correct is a question of law, which an appellate court resolves indepen-\n                    dently of the lower court\u2019s decision.\n                 2. Jury Instructions: Proof: Appeal and Error. In an appeal based upon\n                    a claim of an erroneous jury instruction, the appellant has the burden\n                    to show that the questioned instruction was prejudicial or otherwise\n                    adversely affected a substantial right of the appellant.\n                 3. Jury Instructions: Appeal and Error. All the jury instructions must be\n                    read together, and if, taken as a whole, they correctly state the law, are\n                    not misleading, and adequately cover the issues supported by the plead-\n                    ings and the evidence, there is no prejudicial error necessitating reversal.\n                 4. ____: ____. A jury instruction which misstates the issues and has a\n                    tend\u00adency to confuse the jury is erroneous.\n                 5. Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. Regardless of whether\n                    the evidence is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, and\n                    regardless of whether the issue is labeled as a failure to direct a verdict,\n                    insufficiency of the evidence, or failure to prove a prima facie case, the\n                    standard is the same: In reviewing a criminal conviction, an appellate\n                    court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass on the credibility\n                    of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence; such matters are for the finder\n                    of fact, and a conviction will be affirmed, in the absence of prejudicial\n                    error, if the evidence admitted at trial, viewed and construed most favor-\n                    ably to the State, is sufficient to support the conviction.\n                 6. Sentences: Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not disturb a sen-\n                    tence imposed within the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion\n                    by the trial court.\n                 7. Judgments: Words and Phrases. An abuse of discretion occurs when\n                    a trial court\u2019s decision is based upon reasons that are untenable or\n\f                                      - 757 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      315 Nebraska Reports\n                                STATE V.

Sentences: Appeal and Error. Where a sentence imposed within the\n       statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court\n       must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in con-\n       sidering and applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal\n       principles in determining the sentence to be imposed.\n 9.    Criminal Law: Homicide: Evidence. To sustain a conviction for man-\n       slaughter, the evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\n       causal connection between the unlawful act and the death of the victim.\n10.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Prosecuting Attorneys: Proof. The same\n       conduct may constitute both unlawful act manslaughter and motor\n       vehicle homicide, and the State has the prosecutorial discretion to pur-\n       sue charges for either offense. But in exercising its discretion to charge\n       under one offense or another, the State must still prove each element of\n       that offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n11.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence. Contributory negligence is not\n       a defense to the charge of motor vehicle homicide. Rather, the issue is\n       whether a defendant\u2019s violation of the law was a contributing factor to\n       the death.\n12.    Homicide: Motor Vehicles: Negligence: Proximate Cause. A victim\u2019s\n       negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a motor vehicle homi-\n       cide case unless the actions of the victim were the sole proximate cause\n       of the accident.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Lori\nA.

He appeals. We affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   At approximately 9:25 p.m. on July 30, 2020, Tvrdy was\ntraveling eastbound in his Dodge Charger on what was then\nNebraska Highway 2 (now Nebraska Parkway) in Lincoln,\nNebraska. On this stretch of road, Highway 2 ran parallel\nto Pioneers Boulevard, which was accessed from the high-\nway via an access road. This access road then merged with\nPioneers Boulevard and continued eastbound. On this eve-\nning, Tvrdy sought to turn left across the westbound lanes\nof Highway 2 traffic. The intersection in question is not con-\ntrolled by a traffic light.\n   When Tvrdy approached the left turn, he slowed, waiting\nfor a car ahead of him to make the turn. Tvrdy then made the\nturn. While in the process of making the left turn, a motor-\ncycle operated by Brady Sweetser, traveling in the westbound\nlanes of Highway 2, collided with the passenger-side front\ndoor of Tvrdy\u2019s vehicle. Sweetser suffered blunt force trauma\nin the collision and died from his injuries. There was evidence\nat trial that Sweetser might have been speeding, including\ntestimony that a neighbor heard the throttling acceleration of\na motorcycle immediately prior to the sound of the collision,\nbut Sweetser\u2019s exact rate of speed was unknown.\n   Tvrdy was transported to a hospital with reports of head\npain. He also suffered several minor cuts and abrasions. Based\nupon the reports of law enforcement officials who responded\nto the scene of the collision, it was thought that Tvrdy might\nbe under the influence of some intoxicating substance. A\npreliminary breath test and other field sobriety tests were\nperformed. Following this drug investigation evaluation, the\nofficer conducting such tests concluded that it was her belief\nthat Tvrdy was under the influence of marijuana. A urine test\nlater showed the presence of \u201cTHC.\u201d\n\f                                - 759 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   315 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE V.

According to statute, \u201cA\nperson commits manslaughter if he or she . . . causes the\ndeath of another unintentionally while in the commission of\nan unlawful act.\u201d 16 To sustain a conviction for manslaughter,\nthe evidence must be sufficient to justify the finding of a\ncausal connection between the unlawful act and the death of\nthe victim. 17\n   [10] The same conduct may constitute both unlawful act\nmanslaughter and motor vehicle homicide, and the State\nhas the prosecutorial discretion to pursue charges for either\noffense. 18 But in exercising its discretion to charge under one\noffense or another, the State must still prove each element of\nthat offense beyond a reasonable doubt. 19\n   [11,12] It has been a longstanding principle that contribu-\ntory negligence is not a defense to the charge of motor vehicle\nhomicide. 20 Rather, the issue is whether a defendant\u2019s viola-\ntion of the law was a contributing factor to the death. 21 Thus,\na victim\u2019s negligence cannot act to absolve the defendant in a\nmotor vehicle homicide case unless the actions of the victim\nwere the sole proximate cause of the accident. 22 All the jury\ninstructions must be read together, and if, taken as a whole,\nthey correctly state the law, are not misleading, and adequately\ncover the issues supported by the pleadings and the evidence,\nthere is no prejudicial error necessitating reversal. 23\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the arguments\non appeal.

The defendant's convictions were affirmed\n\n by a panel of this court in 2011.           Commonwealth v. Middleton, 80\n\n Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2011).         In 2022, a panel of this court\n\n affirmed the denial of the defendant's second motion for a new\n\n trial in part and remanded the matter solely on the issue of\n\n whether, under the applicable Massachusetts standard, the\n\n failure of the Commonwealth to provide certain personnel records\n\n of Massachusetts State Police crime laboratory employees\n\n warranted a new trial.       Commonwealth v. Middleton, 101 Mass.\n\fApp. Ct. 1115 (2022).    On remand, the motion judge, utilizing\n\nthe proper standard, denied the defendant's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   In this appeal, the defendant contends that the motion\n\njudge erred in concluding that the Commonwealth's failure to\n\nprovide exculpatory evidence would not have made a difference in\n\nthe outcome of his trial.    We affirm.\n\n     Background.   We take the background facts from the judge's\n\nsummary of the evidence admitted at trial which is largely\n\nconsistent with the defendant's recitation of the facts, and\n\nwhere it is not, the judge's summary is supported by the record.\n\nAround midnight on January 11, 2005, S. M. and three of his\n\nfriends returned to S. M.'s home in Braintree to find two masked\n\nintruders inside looking for money and drugs.    Over the next\n\nhour, the intruders beat all four victims, ordered them to strip\n\nnaked, and bound them.    The masked men continued to beat S. M.\n\nwhile demanding money and drugs, beat one victim in the head\n\nwith a gun so severely he required stitches, threatened to kill\n\nall of the victims, forced one victim to take the defendant's\n\npenis into her mouth and perform oral sex, and threatened to\n\nrape a third victim.\n\n     During the assaults, the intruders heard someone pull into\n\nthe driveway of the home and they fled to the basement.    One of\n\nthe victims heard one of the intruders yelling, \"Bitch, you need\n\nto come pick us up\" and heard the two intruders communicating\n\n\n                                  2\n\fwith a Nextel two-way radio.   That victim remembered that at\n\nleast once during the assaults, he heard a female's voice on the\n\nother end of the Nextel.    Although none of the victims were able\n\nto identify either of the attackers (because they were masked),\n\nthe Commonwealth tied the defendant to the crimes using\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence, wiretap evidence, and the\n\ntestimony of a cooperating witness (Tia) who was present when\n\nthe defendant and codefendant planned and prepared for the\n\nrobbery, 1 and was also present with the defendant and co-\n\ndefendant after the assaults, when the co-defendant made\n\nincriminating statements.\n\n     After an investigation, the defendant was arrested in\n\nJanuary of 2005 and later indicted.   On separate dates and at\n\nseparate locations, the investigators gathered DNA samples of\n\nthe rape victim and the two co-defendants; the DNA samples were\n\nthen analyzed in the State Police Crime Laboratory (crime lab).\n\nCarol Courtright, a criminologist working at the crime lab,\n\ndetected sperm cells from the oral swab collected from the rape\n\nvictim.   Massachusetts State Trooper Bruce Tobin separately\n\nobtained buccal swabs of each of the co-defendants in the\n\n\n1 The witness testified that the day before the attack, she went\nfor a drive with both defendants. During the trip, co-defendant\nNicholson procured a shotgun and a bulletproof vest, and drove a\nfew times by the home where the victims were attacked while\ntalking about robbing the owner of money and marijuana.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fpresence of their attorneys.   Tobin individually labeled each\n\nbuccal swab and affixed the name of the defendant from whom he\n\ntook the sample, before he sealed and stored the swab at the\n\ncrime lab.   In late 2005, at the crime lab, Hillary Griffiths\n\ntook the three known samples and developed a DNA profile for\n\neach sample.   Another DNA analyst, Rachel Chow, analyzed the\n\nsperm that was preserved from the oral swab of the rape victim.\n\nChow determined that the male DNA profile from the oral swab of\n\nthe victim matched the DNA profile from the defendant's buccal\n\nswab.\n\n     In anticipation of the Commonwealth's introduction of the\n\nDNA evidence, defense counsel made pretrial discovery requests\n\nfor \"background information\" about each person involved in\n\nconducting or reviewing DNA testing in this case.   Before trial,\n\nthe Commonwealth produced information about Hilary Griffiths and\n\nRachel Chow including proficiency test results and resumes.     At\n\ntrial, the Commonwealth did not call Chow or Griffiths to\n\ntestify about the DNA, but rather the DNA evidence was presented\n\nthrough a supervisor of the DNA unit, Caitlin Drugan.

The defendant contends that, despite the fact\n\nthat the DNA samples of each of the co-defendants were\n\nseparately collected and labeled by Trooper Tobin before being\n\nstored at the crime lab, Griffiths switched the exemplars of\n\nMiddletown and Nicholson.

In order to obtain a new trial\n\non the basis of nondisclosed exculpatory evidence, \"a defendant\n\nmust establish (1) that the evidence [was] in the possession,\n\ncustody, or control of the prosecutor or a person subject to the\n\nprosecutor's control; (2) that the evidence is exculpatory; and\n\n(3) prejudice.\"   Commonwealth v.

Pope, 489 Mass. 790, 801 (2022), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Tucceri, 472 Mass. 401, 412 (1992). 2     See\n\nCommonwealth v. Healy, 438 Mass. 672, 680 (2003), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Daye, 411 Mass. 719, 729 (1992) (\"In cases\n\ninvolving a specific request for evidence, we look to the record\n\nto determine 'whether we can be confident that even if the\n\nprosecution had supplied the report to the defendant[] in a\n\ntimely fashion, the report or available evidence disclosed would\n\nnot have influenced the jury'\").       The defendant bears the burden\n\nof establishing that he was prejudiced by the failure to\n\ndisclose the evidence.    See Commonwealth v. Imbert, 479 Mass.\n\n575, 583 (2018).\n\n     In her analysis, the judge applied the most favorable\n\nstandard of review for the defendant, but nevertheless denied\n\nhis second motion for a new trial.      On this record, we perceive\n\nno abuse of discretion.    The judge properly considered whether\n\nthe evidence, had it been disclosed, \"would have influenced\" the\n\njury, Daye, 411 Mass. at 729, and concluded that the defendant\n\nfailed to show that there was a \"reasonable possibility that the\n\n\n\n\n2 If the request for evidence is non-specific, the test is\n\"whether there is a substantial chance that the jury might not\nhave reached verdicts of guilt if the undisclosed evidence had\nbeen introduced in evidence.\" Tucceri, 412 Mass. at 413.\n\n\n                                   8\n\fnondisclosed evidence would have made a difference.\"   Imbert,\n\nsupra.\n\n     The judge carefully considered the nondisclosed evidence in\n\nthe context of the strength of the entire case against the\n\ndefendant.   Commonwealth v. Lykus, 451 Mass. 310, 329-330\n\n(2008).   The judge described how the DNA evidence was just a\n\npart of the Commonwealth's case against the defendant.   In\n\nparticular, Tia, a witness for the Commonwealth, testified at\n\ntrial that she and the defendant had been friends for a couple\n\nof years, and that the day before the home invasion she went on\n\na drive with the defendant and Nicholson.   Tia's testimony\n\nplaced the defendant in the car when they drove by S. M.'s home\n\nin Braintree and Nicholson spoke about robbing S. M. of money\n\nand marijuana.   On the drive Nicholson, who already had a\n\nhandgun in the car, retrieved a shotgun and a bulletproof vest.\n\nDuring the intrusion, Nicholson called Tia on the Nextel radio.\n\nLater, Tia asked Nicholson what happened with the female victim\n\nat the house and Nicholson laughed and told her \"it wasn't him.\"\n\nTia's testimony also placed the defendant in the car with\n\nNicholson and Tia the day after the home invasion, at which time\n\nNicholson threatened to kill Tia's mother, daughter, and Tia,\n\nherself, if Tia spoke to the police.\n\n     Furthermore, as the judge explained, it was Caitlyn Drugan,\n\nnot Griffiths or Chow, who testified at trial that the DNA of\n\n\n                                 9\n\fthe defendant matched the DNA of the sperm taken from the\n\nvictim's mouth. 3   The judge concluded that \"at no time up to and\n\nincluding the present (and despite having filed two motions for\n\na new trial and a revised motion) has the defendant actually\n\nidentified any errors in the DNA analysis . . . or offered any\n\nscientific basis for challenging its accuracy.\"    Moreover, the\n\njudge noted that, with the evidence provided, the defense was\n\nable to argue strenuously at trial that the jury should\n\ndisbelieve that Chow or Griffiths \"performed in a manner that\n\nwas appropriate\" and that \"there's no indication that the oral\n\nswab that was presented to the DNA lab was that of\n\nMr. Middleton[].\"    Although the additional personnel files no\n\ndoubt could have been used for additional impeachment, nothing\n\nin these documents indicated that the concerns with the work of\n\nChow or Griffiths had to do with their work on the defendant's\n\nsample, and more importantly, it remains that Drugan\n\nindependently reviewed the DNA testing and provided an opinion\n\nthat was subject to thorough cross-examination.\n\n     Simply put, the defendant's claim that Griffiths may have\n\nswapped the DNA samples of the defendant and Nicholson remains\n\n\n3 Drugan's opinion testimony at trial relating to the DNA\nevidence was upheld in an earlier ruling of this court because\nshe independently reviewed the DNA evidence. See Commonwealth\nv. Middleton, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 1110. The defendant's claim\nthat Drugan did not independently analyze the evidence is\nwithout support in the record.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fentirely speculative, with no grounding in the personnel files\n\nor in the other evidence presented or available.      Recognizing\n\nthe special deference we owe to the motion judge, who was the\n\ntrial judge and had a superior insight into how the jury reacted\n\nto Drugan's testimony and the defense's attacks upon it, we\n\ndiscern no error in her determination that there was not enough\n\nto establish a substantial basis for a claim of prejudice.\n\n                                      Order entered January 4,\n                                        2023, denying second motion\n                                        for new trial affirmed.\n\n                                      By the Court (Ditkoff,\n                                        Englander & Walsh, JJ. 4),\n\n\n\n                                      Assistant Clerk\n\n\nEntered:    January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n4   The panelists are listed in order of seniority.\n\n\n                                 11\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">NOTICE: Summary decisions issued by the Appeals Court pursuant to M.A.C.

The defendant&#x27;s convictions were affirmed\n\n by a panel of this court in 2011.           Commonwealth v. Middleton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">80\n\n Mass. App. Ct. 1110</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011).         In 2022, a panel of this court\n\n affirmed the denial of the defendant&#x27;s second motion for a new\n\n trial in part and remanded the matter solely on the issue of\n\n whether, under the applicable Massachusetts standard, the\n\n failure of the Commonwealth to provide certain personnel records\n\n of Massachusetts State Police crime laboratory employees\n\n warranted a new trial.       Commonwealth v. Middleton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Mass.\n\fApp. Ct. 1115</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022).    On remand, the motion judge, utilizing\n\nthe proper standard, denied the defendant&#x27;s motion for a new\n\ntrial.   In this appeal, the defendant contends that the motion\n\njudge erred in concluding that the Commonwealth&#x27;s failure to\n\nprovide exculpatory evidence would not have made a difference in\n\nthe outcome of his trial.    We affirm.\n\n     Background.   We take the background facts from the judge&#x27;s\n\nsummary of the evidence admitted at trial which is largely\n\nconsistent with the defendant&#x27;s recitation of the facts, and\n\nwhere it is not, the judge&#x27;s summary is supported by the record.\n\nAround midnight on January 11, 2005, S. M. and three of his\n\nfriends returned to S. M.&#x27;s home in Braintree to find two masked\n\nintruders inside looking for money and drugs.    Over the next\n\nhour, the intruders beat all four victims, ordered them to strip\n\nnaked, and bound them.    The masked men continued to beat S. M.\n\nwhile demanding money and drugs, beat one victim in the head\n\nwith a gun so severely he required stitches, threatened to kill\n\nall of the victims, forced one victim to take the defendant&#x27;s\n\npenis into her mouth and perform oral sex, and threatened to\n\nrape a third victim.\n\n     During the assaults, the intruders heard someone pull into\n\nthe driveway of the home and they fled to the basement.    One of\n\nthe victims heard one of the intruders yelling, &quot;Bitch, you need\n\nto come pick us up&quot; and heard the two intruders communicating\n\n\n                                  2\n\fwith a Nextel two-way radio.   That victim remembered that at\n\nleast once during the assaults, he heard a female&#x27;s voice on the\n\nother end of the Nextel.    Although none of the victims were able\n\nto identify either of the attackers (because they were masked),\n\nthe Commonwealth tied the defendant to the crimes using\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence, wiretap evidence, and the\n\ntestimony of a cooperating witness (Tia) who was present when\n\nthe defendant and codefendant planned and prepared for the\n\nrobbery, 1 and was also present with the defendant and co-\n\ndefendant after the assaults, when the co-defendant made\n\nincriminating statements.\n\n     After an investigation, the defendant was arrested in\n\nJanuary of 2005 and later indicted.   On separate dates and at\n\nseparate locations, the investigators gathered DNA samples of\n\nthe rape victim and the two co-defendants; the DNA samples were\n\nthen analyzed in the State Police Crime Laboratory (crime lab).\n\nCarol Courtright, a criminologist working at the crime lab,\n\ndetected sperm cells from the oral swab collected from the rape\n\nvictim.   Massachusetts State Trooper Bruce Tobin separately\n\nobtained buccal swabs of each of the co-defendants in the\n\n\n1 The witness testified that the day before the attack, she went\nfor a drive with both defendants. During the trip, co-defendant\nNicholson procured a shotgun and a bulletproof vest, and drove a\nfew times by the home where the victims were attacked while\ntalking about robbing the owner of money and marijuana.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fpresence of their attorneys.   Tobin individually labeled each\n\nbuccal swab and affixed the name of the defendant from whom he\n\ntook the sample, before he sealed and stored the swab at the\n\ncrime lab.   In late 2005, at the crime lab, Hillary Griffiths\n\ntook the three known samples and developed a DNA profile for\n\neach sample.   Another DNA analyst, Rachel Chow, analyzed the\n\nsperm that was preserved from the oral swab of the rape victim.\n\nChow determined that the male DNA profile from the oral swab of\n\nthe victim matched the DNA profile from the defendant&#x27;s buccal\n\nswab.\n\n     In anticipation of the Commonwealth&#x27;s introduction of the\n\nDNA evidence, defense counsel made pretrial discovery requests\n\nfor &quot;background information&quot; about each person involved in\n\nconducting or reviewing DNA testing in this case.   Before trial,\n\nthe Commonwealth produced information about Hilary Griffiths and\n\nRachel Chow including proficiency test results and resumes.     At\n\ntrial, the Commonwealth did not call Chow or Griffiths to\n\ntestify about the DNA, but rather the DNA evidence was presented\n\nthrough a supervisor of the DNA unit, Caitlin Drugan.   Drugan\n\ndid not perform the analysis but independently evaluated Chow&#x27;s\n\nand Griffiths&#x27;s work, confirmed their analyses, and offered her\n\nown opinion that the defendant was a statistical match for the\n\nDNA found in the rape victim&#x27;s mouth.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f     More than a decade after the defendant was convicted, the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s ongoing discovery efforts revealed additional,\n\npreviously undisclosed personnel file information about\n\nGriffiths&#x27;s and Chow&#x27;s employment at the crime lab.   This\n\nadditional information included documents dated in 2006, by\n\nwhich Griffiths and Chow were separately notified that they were\n\nsuspended from certain analytical duties.   The suspensions\n\nreferenced &quot;instances of DNA . . . discrepancies&quot; in the few\n\nmonths preceding the suspensions, and issues with their &quot;skill\n\nset to focus on tasks without sample mix-ups, as aliquots are\n\nnot placed in appropriate tubes/rows.&quot;   As we noted in our\n\nAugust 12, 2022 decision, &quot;the personnel files also contained\n\ninformation prepared after the date of trial but that related to\n\nGriffiths&#x27;s work performance at and around the time of her work\n\non the samples in this case -- a 2009 State Police report\n\nincluding indirect reports that Griffiths &#x27;was not capable of\n\nperforming daily exemplar work until shortly before June 3,\n\n2008,&#x27; and indications from Griffiths in an undated transcript\n\nexcerpt and an e-mail exchange with a supervisor in 2013\n\nsuggesting that lab personnel were hiding mistakes made during\n\ntesting.&quot;   Middleton, 101 Mass.

The judge described how the DNA evidence was just a\n\npart of the Commonwealth&#x27;s case against the defendant.   In\n\nparticular, Tia, a witness for the Commonwealth, testified at\n\ntrial that she and the defendant had been friends for a couple\n\nof years, and that the day before the home invasion she went on\n\na drive with the defendant and Nicholson.   Tia&#x27;s testimony\n\nplaced the defendant in the car when they drove by S. M.&#x27;s home\n\nin Braintree and Nicholson spoke about robbing S. M. of money\n\nand marijuana.   On the drive Nicholson, who already had a\n\nhandgun in the car, retrieved a shotgun and a bulletproof vest.\n\nDuring the intrusion, Nicholson called Tia on the Nextel radio.\n\nLater, Tia asked Nicholson what happened with the female victim\n\nat the house and Nicholson laughed and told her &quot;it wasn&#x27;t him.&quot;\n\nTia&#x27;s testimony also placed the defendant in the car with\n\nNicholson and Tia the day after the home invasion, at which time\n\nNicholson threatened to kill Tia&#x27;s mother, daughter, and Tia,\n\nherself, if Tia spoke to the police.\n\n     Furthermore, as the judge explained, it was Caitlyn Drugan,\n\nnot Griffiths or Chow, who testified at trial that the DNA of\n\n\n                                 9\n\fthe defendant matched the DNA of the sperm taken from the\n\nvictim&#x27;s mouth. 3   The judge concluded that &quot;at no time up to and\n\nincluding the present (and despite having filed two motions for\n\na new trial and a revised motion) has the defendant actually\n\nidentified any errors in the DNA analysis . . . or offered any\n\nscientific basis for challenging its accuracy.&quot;    Moreover, the\n\njudge noted that, with the evidence provided, the defense was\n\nable to argue strenuously at trial that the jury should\n\ndisbelieve that Chow or Griffiths &quot;performed in a manner that\n\nwas appropriate&quot; and that &quot;there&#x27;s no indication that the oral\n\nswab that was presented to the DNA lab was that of\n\nMr. Middleton[].&quot;    Although the additional personnel files no\n\ndoubt could have been used for additional impeachment, nothing\n\nin these documents indicated that the concerns with the work of\n\nChow or Griffiths had to do with their work on the defendant&#x27;s\n\nsample, and more importantly, it remains that Drugan\n\nindependently reviewed the DNA testing and provided an opinion\n\nthat was subject to thorough cross-examination.\n\n     Simply put, the defendant&#x27;s claim that Griffiths may have\n\nswapped the DNA samples of the defendant and Nicholson remains\n\n\n3 Drugan&#x27;s opinion testimony at trial relating to the DNA\nevidence was upheld in an earlier ruling of this court because\nshe independently reviewed the DNA evidence. See Commonwealth\nv. Middleton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">80 Mass. App. Ct. 1110</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The defendant&#x27;s claim\nthat Drugan did not independently analyze the evidence is\nwithout support in the record.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fentirely speculative, with no grounding in the personnel files\n\nor in the other evidence presented or available.      Recognizing\n\nthe special deference we owe to the motion judge, who was the\n\ntrial judge and had a superior insight into how the jury reacted\n\nto Drugan&#x27;s testimony and the defense&#x27;s attacks upon it, we\n\ndiscern no error in her determination that there was not enough\n\nto establish a substantial basis for a claim of prejudice.\n\n                                      Order entered January 4,\n                                        2023, denying second motion\n                                        for new trial affirmed.\n\n                                      By the Court (Ditkoff,\n                                        Englander &amp; Walsh, JJ. 4),\n\n\n\n                                      Assistant Clerk\n\n\nEntered:    January 19, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n4   The panelists are listed in order of seniority.\n\n\n                                 11\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2225627/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2232619/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2757953/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3202903/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4276931/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6452641/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6453847/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6454993/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6463191/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7089964/"]}]}
