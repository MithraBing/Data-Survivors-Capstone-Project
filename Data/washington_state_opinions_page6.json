The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm\n\nthe District Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n       Because we recently outlined this case\u2019s procedural history in affirming the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of another \u00a7 3582 motion, see United States v. Washington, No.\n\n22-3264, 2023 WL 2182376, at *1 (3d Cir. Feb. 23, 2023) (per curiam), we do so only\n\nbriefly here. In short, Washington was convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin and\n\nsentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2015, he filed a motion under 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3582 arguing that he was entitled to resentencing under Amendment 782 to the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines. The District Court determined that, while Washington was\n\neligible for resentencing, no decrease to his sentence was warranted based on its\n\nconsideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\n       Washington then filed another \u00a7 3582 motion, raising more arguments concerning\n\nAmendment 782. The District Court determined that the motion was meritless. We\n\naffirmed, concluding that Washington was not entitled to relitigate the District Court\u2019s\n\ninitial denial of relief. See Washington, 2023 WL 2182376, at *2.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       On June 8, 2023, Washington filed the instant motion for compassionate release.\n\nDkt No. 1825. Washington argued that he was entitled to compassionate release based on\n\n(1) a serious health risk due to the spread of COVID-19 and other contaminants; (2)\n\nsufficient rehabilitation; and (3) subsequent changes in applicable sentencing law. The\n\nGovernment responded in opposition. On August 30, 2023, the District Court denied the\n\nmotion, concluding that Washington failed to present extraordinary and compelling\n\nreasons that warrant a reduction, and additionally, may not relitigate arguments denied in\n\nprior motions. Dkt No. 1833. Washington appeals.1\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion a district court\u2019s order denying a motion for compassionate release. United\n\nStates v. Pawlowski, 967 F.3d 327, 330 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201c[W]e will not disturb the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision unless there is a definite and firm conviction that it committed a\n\nclear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant\n\nfactors.\u201d Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). We may take summary action if the\n\nappeal presents no substantial question. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n1\n While there is a question regarding the timeliness of Washington\u2019s notice of appeal, we\nneed not resolve that question to decide this case, for Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(b)(1)(A)\u2019s 14-day appeal period is not a jurisdictional rule, see United States\nv. Muhammud, 701 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir. 2012), and the Government asks us to\nsummarily affirm in lieu of dismissing.\n\n                                             3\n\f       We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. Under\n\n\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), a district court may reduce a prison term if \u201cextraordinary and\n\ncompelling reasons warrant such a reduction.\u201d We conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in concluding that the circumstances presented by Washington did\n\nnot amount to extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying release.\n\n       First, in determining that Washington had not established extraordinary and\n\ncompelling reasons, the District Court reasonably relied on the absence of evidence of\n\nWashington\u2019s alleged health issues and his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broadfield, 5 F.4th 801, 803 (7th Cir. 2021) (reasoning that \u201ca\n\nprisoner who remains at elevated risk because he has declined to be vaccinated cannot\n\nplausibly characterize that risk as an \u2018extraordinary and compelling\u2019 justification for\n\nrelease\u201d). Moreover, we note that, to the extent that Washington relies on generalized\n\nconcerns regarding the institution\u2019s alleged failure to combat the pandemic, these\n\nallegations are insufficient to constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons. See\n\nUnited States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (explaining that \u201cthe mere\n\nexistence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular\n\nprison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release\u201d). This conclusion is\n\nsimilarly true with regard to Washington\u2019s concerns pertaining to the other contaminants\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwhich Washington alleges present a health concern to him; he has failed to present any\n\nevidence to substantiate these claims.\n\n       Second, while Washington has provided evidence of his rehabilitation efforts, the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that rehabilitation alone cannot constitute\n\nextraordinary and compelling grounds under \u00a7 3582, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(t), and he has\n\nnot shown that those efforts combined with his health concerns warrant relief.\n\n       Finally, as we have previously explained, Washington is not entitled to relitigate\n\nthe District Court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim concerning Amendment 782. See\n\nWashington, 2023 WL 2182376, at *2.\n\n       Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">DLD-054                                                         NOT PRECEDENTIAL\n\n                       UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                            FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                 ___________\n\n                                       No. 23-2782\n                                       ___________\n\n                            UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n                                             v.\n\n                             GREGORY WASHINGTON,\n                                             Appellant\n                       ____________________________________\n\n                     On Appeal from the United States District Court\n                        for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n                     (D.C.

The People did not oppose the motion to dismiss this docket, nor did they acknowledge the companion case in their opposition papers.</p>\n<p>Upon review and consideration of the submissions, court file, and relevant legal authority, the Court finds that the People failed to exercise good faith and due diligence in the discharge of their discovery duties and, thus:</p>\n<p>The People's CoCs filed on April 24, 2023, at 9:33 pm and 10:01 pm (Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX) and on May 8, 2023 (Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX), are deemed INVALID and ILLUSORY; and Dismissal pursuant to CPL \u00a7\u00a7 170.30 (e), 30.20 and 30.30 is GRANTED for both Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX and Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX.</p>\n<br><br><b><i>RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY</i></b>\n<p>Defendant Renee McDonald was arrested on January 23, 2023 (the January arrest) and charged with one count each of Penal Law (\"PL\") \u00a7 120.14 (1) (menacing in the second degree), [*2]a misdemeanor, and PL \u00a7 240.26 (1) (harassment in the second degree), a violation. Ms. McDonald was arraigned the following day and released on her own recognizance. </p>\n<p>On February 6, 2023 (the February arrest), defendant was arrested and charged with one count each of PL \u00a7 215.50 (3) (criminal contempt in the second degree), PL \u00a7 145.00 (1) (criminal mischief in the fourth degree) and PL \u00a7 120.15 (menacing in the third degree). Defendant was arraigned on February 7, 2023, and released under supervision. </p>\n<p>On April 24, 2023, the People filed their CoC and SoR at 9:22 pm and their supplemental CoC and supplemental SoR at 10:01 pm for the January arrest. </p>\n<p>At a discovery conference held on June 2, 2023, Bronx Defenders was relieved as counsel, and Attorney Escobedo was assigned as 18-b counsel. </p>\n<p>At the conference held on June 7, 2023, the court confirmed that the People had filed their CoC and SoR concerning the February arrest off-calendar on May 8, 2023. However, a bench warrant was ordered because defendant did not appear. On June 14, 2023, defendant returned to court, and the dockets were adjourned for a discovery conference on August 2, 2023. At a subsequent discovery conference held on September 15, 2023, defense counsel requested a motion schedule. </p>\n<br><br><i><b>DISCUSSION</b></i>\n<br><br><b>I. <i>The Parties' Arguments</i></b> <sup><b>[FN1]</b></sup>\n\n<p>Initially, defense counsel submits that the People's CoC and supplemental CoC should be deemed invalid because they were filed after court operations had closed for the day (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 4). Counsel further claims that of the seven officers identified by the People as having relevant evidence concerning any charged offense, the defense has only received partial disclosure regarding two officers named as testifying witnesses (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7). Specifically, counsel avers that the prosecution provided summary letters concerning two IAB allegations against Police Officer (\"PO\") Alvarado-Mota and one IAB case against PO DeJesus (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7-8). Defendant also asserts that other than a redacted three-page Internal Case Management System Worksheet concerning the IAB case against PO DeJesus, the People did not disclose underlying <i>Giglio</i> documents nor any discoverable materials from NYPD Legal or the Central Personnel Index (\"CPI\") for PO Alvarado-Mota (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7-8). Counsel asserts that no further CCRB information was exchanged beyond records dated October 13, 2020 (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 10). Counsel also argues that the People were obligated to disclose <i>Giglio</i> information concerning PO Kelly and Sergeant (\"Sgt.\") Espinosa, although neither was named as a testifying witness (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 12).</p>\n<p>Defendant seeks <i>Giglio</i> disclosure concerning all involved officers, whether the claims are substantiated, unsubstantiated, or exonerated, and including underlying documents (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 13). Defense maintains that the prosecution has failed to diligently discharge its disclosure obligation regarding items enumerated in CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) [*3]and, thus, the People's CoC was illusory and did not stop their speedy trial time from accruing (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 13-15). Counsel seeks an order suppressing statement evidence or, alternatively, a <i>Huntley</i> hearing (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 5). Counsel maintains that the prosecution must be deemed untimely pursuant to CPL \u00a7170.30 (e), \u00a7 30.20, and \u00a7 30.30 if the People are charged with the period of their non-compliance (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 15). Lastly, defendant seeks suppression of any evidence of her prior criminal history or bad acts or, alternatively, a hearing pursuant to <i>Sandoval/Molineux/Ventimiglia</i> (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 17).</p>\n<p>Initially, the People argue their CoC filings were valid because the prosecution is not required to disclose the entire personnel file for its testifying officers (People's affirmation at 5). The People further maintain that they have complied with their <i>Giglio</i> disclosure obligations because they provided defense counsel with a two-page summary of allegations for POs Alvarado-Mota and DeJesus, along with 11 pages of underlying documents (People's affirmation at 6). The prosecution contends that defense counsel has not established that non-testifying PO Kelly and Sgt. Espinosa played an integral role in the arrest or investigation such that disclosure is warranted pursuant to <i>People v Peralta</i>, 190 NYS 3d 873, 956 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] (People's affirmation at 7). </p>\n<p>The People maintain that they complied with disclosure of CCRB records pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20 (2) because they disclosed what was in their possession and have no further duty regarding documents that are not within their actual or constructive possession (People's affirmation at 6). Further, the People aver that they exercised good faith and due diligence to comply with their obligations and claim that defense counsel waited too long to assert that Sgt. Espinosa had knowledge regarding defendant's case (People's affirmation at 5). The prosecution asserts that 30.30 time is quantifiable in days and, thus, their CoC filing was timely and that where the defense has failed to assert any prejudice caused by purported discovery deficiencies, dismissal of the accusatory instrument is unwarranted (People's affirmation at 11). </p>\n<p>Lastly, the prosecution opposes defendant's motion to suppress statements and preclude evidence of prior convictions and bad acts, as well as defendant's reservation of rights; however, the People consent to defendant's request for a <i>Huntley</i> hearing and request that the issue of preclusion of prior convictions and bad acts be referred to the trial court (People's affirmation at 14-17). </p>\n<br><br><b>II. <i>Applicable Standard for CoC Challenge</i></b>\n<p>To counter a motion to dismiss claiming that the People's CoC is illusory due to the prosecution's alleged failure to comply with CPL \u00a7 245.20, the People must demonstrate that they met their burden by detailing their efforts to obtain discoverable information (<i>see People v Hernandez</i>, 81 Misc 3d 1201[A], 2023 NY Slip Op 51201[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] citing<i> People v Adrovic</i>, 69 Misc 3d 563, 572 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2020]; CPL \u00a7 245.50 [3]).</p>\n<p>If the record does not establish that the People have detailed their efforts to discharge their obligation such that a court cannot determine their due diligence, the CoC must be deemed invalid (<i>see Hernandez</i>, 2023 NY Slip Op 51201[U], *7 citing <i>People v Perez</i>, 75 Misc 3d 1205[A], 2022 NY Slip Op 50387[U], *3 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2022]; <i>People v Georgiopoulous</i>, 71 Misc 3d 1215[A], 2021 NY Slip Op 50380[U], *6 [Sup Ct, Queens County 2021]; <i>People v Valdez</i>, 80 Misc 3d 544, 547 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2023]). </p>\n<p>While there is no one-size fits all response to determining discovery compliance, this [*4]Court has held that \"by following-up, the very essence of what it means to exercise due diligence,\" the prosecution's CoC can be deemed valid although some discovery is missing and/or belatedly disclosed (<i>see Hernandez</i>, 2023 NY Slip Op 51201[U], *15 citing <i>People v Franklin</i>, 78 Misc 3d 1232[A], 2023 NY Slip Op 50400[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023]).</p>\n<p>Recently, the Court of Appeals addressed the question of the People's due diligence in <i>People v Bay</i>, \u2014 NE3d &amp;mdash, 2023 NY Slip Op 06407 [2023]. The <i>Bay</i> court found that the \"key question in determining if a proper certificate of compliance has been filed is whether the prosecution has <i>exercised due diligence and made reasonable inquiries</i> to determine the existence of material and information subject to discovery,\" a case-specific inquiry of the record at bar (<i>see Bay</i>, 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *15-16 [emphasis added]; CPL \u00a7\u00a7 245.20 [1], 245.50 [1]). </p>\n<p>Further, the mere demonstration of good faith will not overcome a lack of prosecutorial due diligence (<i>see Bay</i>, 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *16). Accordingly, the <i>Bay</i> decision enumerated several factors that courts should consider to adjudicate the reasonableness of the People's response to comply with their mandated disclosures, including:</p>\n<p>\"the volume of discovery provided and outstanding, the complexity of the case, how obvious any missing material would likely have been to a prosecutor exercising due diligence, the explanation for any discovery lapse, and the People's response when apprised of any missing discovery\" </p>\n<br><br>(<i>see Bay,</i> 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *16).\n<p>Additionally, the <i>Bay</i> court held that while belated disclosure will not necessarily render a CoC invalid, a supplemental CoC cannot compensate for the failure to exercise due diligence before initial certification (<i>see Bay,</i> 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *17; <i>see also People v Andrews</i>, 2023 NY Slip Op 50867[U], *3-4 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023][\"(CPL \u00a7 245.50) unambiguously references the disclosure of additional information but will not shield the People from failing to disclose evidence already known to them at certification, nor, arguably, from investigating evidence which they had reason to believe existed\"]).</p>\n<p>Moreover, pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.80, a court may impose <i>a remedy or sanction</i> where discoverable information is belatedly disclosed which is <i>appropriate and proportionate</i> to the prejudice suffered by the party entitled to the discovery (CPL \u00a7 245.80 [1] [emphasis added]). </p>\n<p>However, as noted in the <i>Bay</i> decision, following Legislative reforms that bind CPL Article 245 disclosures to CPL \u00a7 30.30 speedy trial time requirements, a court's inquiry of whether the People have demonstrated trial readiness is predicated upon a finding that they have timely filed a proper CoC which certifies their compliance with CPL \u00a7 245.20 disclosures pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.50 (3) and, thus, dismissal as a consequence of the People's unreadiness for trial within their allotted 30.30 clock is a matter of untimeliness and not an issue of the proportionate prejudice caused by the prosecution's belated or missing disclosures (<i>see Bay,</i> 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *20).</p>\n<br><br><b>III. <i>The Court's Analysis</i></b>\n<br><br><i>Timeliness of the People's CoC filings</i>\n<p>Defense counsel asserts that the CoC filings on April 24, 2023, concerning the January arrest, were untimely because the People filed after court operations had ceased for the day. [*5]This Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that submissions sent after 5:00 p.m. on the ninetieth day following arraignment contravene the precise holding set forth in <i>People v Kendzia</i> (<i>see People v Martinez</i>, 80 Misc 3d 312, 319 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023]<i> citing Kendzia</i>, 64 NY2d 331, 337 [1985][The prosecution must state its readiness in two ways: 1) such declaration must be communicated in open court, or by written notice of readiness to defense counsel and the court clerk, and 2) the statement is made when the prosecution is indeed ready to proceed to trial]; <i>see also People v Nichols</i>, 79 Misc 3d 1211[A], 2023 NY Slip Op 50591[U], *4-5 [(T)he Legislature drafted CPL \u00a7 30.30 (1) (b) to quantify the applicable time period in days] citing <i>People v McLean</i>, 77 Misc 3d 492, 498 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2022]; <i>see also People v Middleton</i>, 79 Misc 3d 418, 421-422 [Crim Ct, New York County 2023][\"General Construction Law \u00a7 19 provides: \"A calendar day includes the time from midnight to midnight. [ ] In other words, the People should have until midnight to file their COC/COR on the ninetieth day pursuant to CPL \u00a7 30.30 (l)(b)] [internal citations omitted]).</p>\n<p>Defendant's arguments do not suggest any facts that would prompt the Court to amend its analysis. Accordingly, the People's CoCs dated April 24, 2023, filed at 9:22 pm and 10:01 pm concerning the January arrest, were filed within their statutorily allotted speedy trial time. </p>\n<br><br><i>Giglio discovery</i>\n<p>As a threshold matter, it is well-settled that the CCRB is not a law enforcement agency nor an agency within the prosecution's control (<i>see People v. Carter</i>, 76 Misc 3d 1206[A], 2022 NY Slip Op 50837[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2022]. The People have stated they disclosed CCRB records, which were already in their possession, and, as such, they have satisfied their duty pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20 (2) (<i>see Peralta</i> at 956-957). </p>\n<p>Defense counsel describes the extent of the People's CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1)(k) disclosures as follows: \"The prosecution provided a summary letter identifying two IAB LOG #s for Officer Catherine Alvarado-Mota and one IAB LOG # for Officer Madelin DeJesus,\" \"the Internal Case Management System Worksheet- Internal Affairs provided for Catherine Alvarado-Mota is improperly redacted, and the prosecution's summary identified four substantiated allegations concerning PO DeJesus. However, other than the three-page Internal Case Management System Worksheet- Internal Affairs, no other underlying material, and no other <i>Giglio </i>material was provided\" (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 12 [internal quotations omitted]). </p>\n<p>The People posit that they are not required to disclose an officer's entire personnel file for purposes of impeachment, except where defendant's case is related by subject matter to the allegations of misconduct (<i>see People v Johnson</i>, 218 AD3d 1347, 1350 [4th Dept 2023]. However, the prosecution's bald statement that \"the People provided a two-page summary of allegations for testifying Officers along with underlying logs of said allegations amounting to eleven pages,\" unsupported by any documentary evidence appended to the opposition papers, is suggestive of a far thriftier response to defendant's <i>Giglio</i> demands than disclosing the officers' entire personnel records.</p>\n<p>First, the prosecution does not clarify whether the \"two-page summary\" was prepared by the People or by IAB. The issue is not inconsequential, \"(a)s the Appellate Division has held, the statute does not allow the People to fulfill this mandate by merely supplying summary letters about their police witnesses' misconduct (<i>see People v Figueroa</i>, 78 Misc 3d 1203[A], 2023 NY Slip Op. 50149[U], *2 [Crim Ct, Queens County 2023] citing <i>Matter of Jayson C.</i>, 200 AD3d 447, 448-49 [1st Dept 2021]).</p>\n<p>Secondly, the People do not address the allegation that an IAB Worksheet related to PO [*6]Alvarado-Mota was improperly redacted, nor do they provide this Court with a basis to conclude whether the four substantiated IAB charges against PO DeJesus were included in their eleven-page disclosure and, if not, explain why the information should be withheld as not discoverable pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the prosecution's arguments against <i>Giglio</i> disclosure of non-testifying officers is far more expansive, but insofar as defense counsel has provided no evidence that the non-testifying officers played an integral role in the arrest and/or investigation of defendant, the Court can discern from the facts at bar that <i>Giglio</i> disclosure is not warranted for PO Kelly, Sgt. Espinosa, nor any other officers referenced in the motion (<i>see Peralta</i> at 954-955). </p>\n<p>However, the Court cannot divine the prosecution's compliance, so it must rely upon the record to determine whether the People have adhered, either quantitatively or qualitatively, to their discovery mandate concerning POs Mota-Alvarado and DeJesus (<i>see Bay,</i> 2023 NY Slip Op 06407, *22). Complying with the discovery statute is the People's obligation and the record at bar is devoid of evidence to sustain their burden. </p>\n<p>Accordingly, concerning Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX, the January arrest, the People's CoC, and supplemental CoC, filed on April 25, 2023, at 9:22 pm and 10:01 pm, respectively, are deemed INVALID.</p>\n<p>Additionally, concerning Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX, the February arrest, the People's CoC, filed on May 8, 2023, is also deemed INVALID.</p>\n<br><br><b><i>IV. The CPL \u00a7 30.30 Calculation</i></b>\n<p>In a motion to dismiss an accusatory instrument where the top charge is a misdemeanor, pursuant to CPL \u00a7 30.30 (1), defendant has the initial burden to demonstrate that the prosecution failed to declare readiness for trial within the statutorily prescribed time, ninety days (<i>see</i> CPL \u00a7 30.30 [1] [b]; <i>see also People v Flores</i>, 79 Misc 3d 1239[A], 2023 NY Slip Op 50834[U], *2 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] citing <i>People v Galino</i>, 38 NY3d 199, 205 [Ct of App 2022]; <i>see also</i> CPL \u00a7 30.30 [4]). The burden then shifts to the People to identify excludable delays (<i>see People v Luperon</i>, 85 NY2d 71, 77-78 [1995] [\"(T)he People must ordinarily identify the exclusions on which they intend to rely, and the defense must identify any legal or factual impediments to the use of these exclusions\"]). </p>\n<br><br><i>Docket No.: Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX, the January arrest</i>\n<p>The People's 30.30 calculation commenced on January 25, 2023, the day after defendant's arraignment.

At a court appearance held on May 1, 2023, the People advised the court that their CoC, SoR, and supplemental CoC and SoR had been filed off-calendar (April 24, 2023 to May 2, 2023 = <b>8 days</b> chargeable because the contemporaneous CoC filings have been deemed illusory).

Specifically, defendant asserts that dismissal is warranted where the prosecution failed to comply with their disclosure obligations pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) prior to filing their Certificate of Compliance (\"CoC\") and Statement of Readiness (\"SoR\"). Defense counsel further argues that the case must be dismissed if the People are charged with the period of their non-compliance. The People opposed the motion on December 4, 2023. By notice of omnibus motion also dated October 20, 2023, defense counsel moved on the same statutory grounds to dismiss a companion case following defendant's violation of the Temporary Order of Protection granted to the complaining witness on January 24, 2023 (Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX, the \"February arrest\"). The People did not oppose the motion to dismiss this docket, nor did they acknowledge the companion case in their opposition papers.</p>\n<p>Upon review and consideration of the submissions, court file, and relevant legal authority, the Court finds that the People failed to exercise good faith and due diligence in the discharge of their discovery duties and, thus:</p>\n<p>The People's CoCs filed on April 24, 2023, at 9:33 pm and 10:01 pm (Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX) and on May 8, 2023 (Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX), are deemed INVALID and ILLUSORY; and Dismissal pursuant to CPL \u00a7\u00a7 170.30 (e), 30.20 and 30.30 is GRANTED for both Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX and Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX.</p>\n<br><br><b><i>RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY</i></b>\n<p>Defendant Renee McDonald was arrested on January 23, 2023 (the January arrest) and charged with one count each of Penal Law (\"PL\") \u00a7 120.14 (1) (menacing in the second degree), [*2]a misdemeanor, and PL \u00a7 240.26 (1) (harassment in the second degree), a violation. Ms. McDonald was arraigned the following day and released on her own recognizance. </p>\n<p>On February 6, 2023 (the February arrest), defendant was arrested and charged with one count each of PL \u00a7 215.50 (3) (criminal contempt in the second degree), PL \u00a7 145.00 (1) (criminal mischief in the fourth degree) and PL \u00a7 120.15 (menacing in the third degree). Defendant was arraigned on February 7, 2023, and released under supervision. </p>\n<p>On April 24, 2023, the People filed their CoC and SoR at 9:22 pm and their supplemental CoC and supplemental SoR at 10:01 pm for the January arrest. </p>\n<p>At a discovery conference held on June 2, 2023, Bronx Defenders was relieved as counsel, and Attorney Escobedo was assigned as 18-b counsel. </p>\n<p>At the conference held on June 7, 2023, the court confirmed that the People had filed their CoC and SoR concerning the February arrest off-calendar on May 8, 2023. However, a bench warrant was ordered because defendant did not appear. On June 14, 2023, defendant returned to court, and the dockets were adjourned for a discovery conference on August 2, 2023. At a subsequent discovery conference held on September 15, 2023, defense counsel requested a motion schedule. </p>\n<br><br><i><b>DISCUSSION</b></i>\n<br><br><b>I. <i>The Parties' Arguments</i></b> <sup><b>[FN1]</b></sup>\n\n<p>Initially, defense counsel submits that the People's CoC and supplemental CoC should be deemed invalid because they were filed after court operations had closed for the day (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 4). Counsel further claims that of the seven officers identified by the People as having relevant evidence concerning any charged offense, the defense has only received partial disclosure regarding two officers named as testifying witnesses (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7). Specifically, counsel avers that the prosecution provided summary letters concerning two IAB allegations against Police Officer (\"PO\") Alvarado-Mota and one IAB case against PO DeJesus (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7-8). Defendant also asserts that other than a redacted three-page Internal Case Management System Worksheet concerning the IAB case against PO DeJesus, the People did not disclose underlying <i>Giglio</i> documents nor any discoverable materials from NYPD Legal or the Central Personnel Index (\"CPI\") for PO Alvarado-Mota (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 7-8). Counsel asserts that no further CCRB information was exchanged beyond records dated October 13, 2020 (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 10). Counsel also argues that the People were obligated to disclose <i>Giglio</i> information concerning PO Kelly and Sergeant (\"Sgt.\") Espinosa, although neither was named as a testifying witness (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 12).</p>\n<p>Defendant seeks <i>Giglio</i> disclosure concerning all involved officers, whether the claims are substantiated, unsubstantiated, or exonerated, and including underlying documents (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 13). Defense maintains that the prosecution has failed to diligently discharge its disclosure obligation regarding items enumerated in CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1) [*3]and, thus, the People's CoC was illusory and did not stop their speedy trial time from accruing (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 13-15). Counsel seeks an order suppressing statement evidence or, alternatively, a <i>Huntley</i> hearing (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 5). Counsel maintains that the prosecution must be deemed untimely pursuant to CPL \u00a7170.30 (e), \u00a7 30.20, and \u00a7 30.30 if the People are charged with the period of their non-compliance (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 15). Lastly, defendant seeks suppression of any evidence of her prior criminal history or bad acts or, alternatively, a hearing pursuant to <i>Sandoval/Molineux/Ventimiglia</i> (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 17).</p>\n<p>Initially, the People argue their CoC filings were valid because the prosecution is not required to disclose the entire personnel file for its testifying officers (People's affirmation at 5). The People further maintain that they have complied with their <i>Giglio</i> disclosure obligations because they provided defense counsel with a two-page summary of allegations for POs Alvarado-Mota and DeJesus, along with 11 pages of underlying documents (People's affirmation at 6). The prosecution contends that defense counsel has not established that non-testifying PO Kelly and Sgt. Espinosa played an integral role in the arrest or investigation such that disclosure is warranted pursuant to <i>People v Peralta</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">190 NYS 3d 873</span>, 956 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] (People's affirmation at 7). </p>\n<p>The People maintain that they complied with disclosure of CCRB records pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20 (2) because they disclosed what was in their possession and have no further duty regarding documents that are not within their actual or constructive possession (People's affirmation at 6). Further, the People aver that they exercised good faith and due diligence to comply with their obligations and claim that defense counsel waited too long to assert that Sgt. Espinosa had knowledge regarding defendant's case (People's affirmation at 5). The prosecution asserts that 30.30 time is quantifiable in days and, thus, their CoC filing was timely and that where the defense has failed to assert any prejudice caused by purported discovery deficiencies, dismissal of the accusatory instrument is unwarranted (People's affirmation at 11). </p>\n<p>Lastly, the prosecution opposes defendant's motion to suppress statements and preclude evidence of prior convictions and bad acts, as well as defendant's reservation of rights; however, the People consent to defendant's request for a <i>Huntley</i> hearing and request that the issue of preclusion of prior convictions and bad acts be referred to the trial court (People's affirmation at 14-17). </p>\n<br><br><b>II. <i>Applicable Standard for CoC Challenge</i></b>\n<p>To counter a motion to dismiss claiming that the People's CoC is illusory due to the prosecution's alleged failure to comply with CPL \u00a7 245.20, the People must demonstrate that they met their burden by detailing their efforts to obtain discoverable information (<i>see People v Hernandez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">81 Misc 3d 1201</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 51201</span>[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] citing<i> People v Adrovic</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Misc 3d 563</span>, 572 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2020]; CPL \u00a7 245.50 [3]).</p>\n<p>If the record does not establish that the People have detailed their efforts to discharge their obligation such that a court cannot determine their due diligence, the CoC must be deemed invalid (<i>see Hernandez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 51201</span>[U], *7 citing <i>People v Perez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">75 Misc 3d 1205</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 NY Slip Op 50387</span>[U], *3 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2022]; <i>People v Georgiopoulous</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">71 Misc 3d 1215</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 NY Slip Op 50380</span>[U], *6 [Sup Ct, Queens County 2021]; <i>People v Valdez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">80 Misc 3d 544</span>, 547 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2023]). </p>\n<p>While there is no one-size fits all response to determining discovery compliance, this [*4]Court has held that \"by following-up, the very essence of what it means to exercise due diligence,\" the prosecution's CoC can be deemed valid although some discovery is missing and/or belatedly disclosed (<i>see Hernandez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 51201</span>[U], *15 citing <i>People v Franklin</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">78 Misc 3d 1232</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 50400</span>[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023]).</p>\n<p>Recently, the Court of Appeals addressed the question of the People's due diligence in <i>People v Bay</i>, \u2014 NE3d &amp;mdash, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span> [2023]. The <i>Bay</i> court found that the \"key question in determining if a proper certificate of compliance has been filed is whether the prosecution has <i>exercised due diligence and made reasonable inquiries</i> to determine the existence of material and information subject to discovery,\" a case-specific inquiry of the record at bar (<i>see Bay</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *15-16 [emphasis added]; CPL \u00a7\u00a7 245.20 [1], 245.50 [1]). </p>\n<p>Further, the mere demonstration of good faith will not overcome a lack of prosecutorial due diligence (<i>see Bay</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *16). Accordingly, the <i>Bay</i> decision enumerated several factors that courts should consider to adjudicate the reasonableness of the People's response to comply with their mandated disclosures, including:</p>\n<p>\"the volume of discovery provided and outstanding, the complexity of the case, how obvious any missing material would likely have been to a prosecutor exercising due diligence, the explanation for any discovery lapse, and the People's response when apprised of any missing discovery\" </p>\n<br><br>(<i>see Bay,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *16).\n<p>Additionally, the <i>Bay</i> court held that while belated disclosure will not necessarily render a CoC invalid, a supplemental CoC cannot compensate for the failure to exercise due diligence before initial certification (<i>see Bay,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *17; <i>see also People v Andrews</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 50867</span>[U], *3-4 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023][\"(CPL \u00a7 245.50) unambiguously references the disclosure of additional information but will not shield the People from failing to disclose evidence already known to them at certification, nor, arguably, from investigating evidence which they had reason to believe existed\"]).</p>\n<p>Moreover, pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.80, a court may impose <i>a remedy or sanction</i> where discoverable information is belatedly disclosed which is <i>appropriate and proportionate</i> to the prejudice suffered by the party entitled to the discovery (CPL \u00a7 245.80 [1] [emphasis added]). </p>\n<p>However, as noted in the <i>Bay</i> decision, following Legislative reforms that bind CPL Article 245 disclosures to CPL \u00a7 30.30 speedy trial time requirements, a court's inquiry of whether the People have demonstrated trial readiness is predicated upon a finding that they have timely filed a proper CoC which certifies their compliance with CPL \u00a7 245.20 disclosures pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.50 (3) and, thus, dismissal as a consequence of the People's unreadiness for trial within their allotted 30.30 clock is a matter of untimeliness and not an issue of the proportionate prejudice caused by the prosecution's belated or missing disclosures (<i>see Bay,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *20).</p>\n<br><br><b>III. <i>The Court's Analysis</i></b>\n<br><br><i>Timeliness of the People's CoC filings</i>\n<p>Defense counsel asserts that the CoC filings on April 24, 2023, concerning the January arrest, were untimely because the People filed after court operations had ceased for the day. [*5]This Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that submissions sent after 5:00 p.m. on the ninetieth day following arraignment contravene the precise holding set forth in <i>People v Kendzia</i> (<i>see People v Martinez</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">80 Misc 3d 312</span>, 319 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023]<i> citing Kendzia</i>, 64 NY2d 331, 337 [1985][The prosecution must state its readiness in two ways: 1) such declaration must be communicated in open court, or by written notice of readiness to defense counsel and the court clerk, and 2) the statement is made when the prosecution is indeed ready to proceed to trial]; <i>see also People v Nichols</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">79 Misc 3d 1211</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 50591</span>[U], *4-5 [(T)he Legislature drafted CPL \u00a7 30.30 (1) (b) to quantify the applicable time period in days] citing <i>People v McLean</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">77 Misc 3d 492</span>, 498 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2022]; <i>see also People v Middleton</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">79 Misc 3d 418</span>, 421-422 [Crim Ct, New York County 2023][\"General Construction Law \u00a7 19 provides: \"A calendar day includes the time from midnight to midnight. [ ] In other words, the People should have until midnight to file their COC/COR on the ninetieth day pursuant to CPL \u00a7 30.30 (l)(b)] [internal citations omitted]).</p>\n<p>Defendant's arguments do not suggest any facts that would prompt the Court to amend its analysis. Accordingly, the People's CoCs dated April 24, 2023, filed at 9:22 pm and 10:01 pm concerning the January arrest, were filed within their statutorily allotted speedy trial time. </p>\n<br><br><i>Giglio discovery</i>\n<p>As a threshold matter, it is well-settled that the CCRB is not a law enforcement agency nor an agency within the prosecution's control (<i>see People v. Carter</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Misc 3d 1206</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 NY Slip Op 50837</span>[U], *6 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2022]. The People have stated they disclosed CCRB records, which were already in their possession, and, as such, they have satisfied their duty pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20 (2) (<i>see Peralta</i> at 956-957). </p>\n<p>Defense counsel describes the extent of the People's CPL \u00a7 245.20 (1)(k) disclosures as follows: \"The prosecution provided a summary letter identifying two IAB LOG #s for Officer Catherine Alvarado-Mota and one IAB LOG # for Officer Madelin DeJesus,\" \"the Internal Case Management System Worksheet- Internal Affairs provided for Catherine Alvarado-Mota is improperly redacted, and the prosecution's summary identified four substantiated allegations concerning PO DeJesus. However, other than the three-page Internal Case Management System Worksheet- Internal Affairs, no other underlying material, and no other <i>Giglio </i>material was provided\" (affirmation of defendant's counsel at 12 [internal quotations omitted]). </p>\n<p>The People posit that they are not required to disclose an officer's entire personnel file for purposes of impeachment, except where defendant's case is related by subject matter to the allegations of misconduct (<i>see People v Johnson</i>, 218 AD3d 1347, 1350 [4th Dept 2023]. However, the prosecution's bald statement that \"the People provided a two-page summary of allegations for testifying Officers along with underlying logs of said allegations amounting to eleven pages,\" unsupported by any documentary evidence appended to the opposition papers, is suggestive of a far thriftier response to defendant's <i>Giglio</i> demands than disclosing the officers' entire personnel records.</p>\n<p>First, the prosecution does not clarify whether the \"two-page summary\" was prepared by the People or by IAB. The issue is not inconsequential, \"(a)s the Appellate Division has held, the statute does not allow the People to fulfill this mandate by merely supplying summary letters about their police witnesses' misconduct (<i>see People v Figueroa</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">78 Misc 3d 1203</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op. 50149</span>[U], *2 [Crim Ct, Queens County 2023] citing <i>Matter of Jayson C.</i>, 200 AD3d 447, 448-49 [1st Dept 2021]).</p>\n<p>Secondly, the People do not address the allegation that an IAB Worksheet related to PO [*6]Alvarado-Mota was improperly redacted, nor do they provide this Court with a basis to conclude whether the four substantiated IAB charges against PO DeJesus were included in their eleven-page disclosure and, if not, explain why the information should be withheld as not discoverable pursuant to CPL \u00a7 245.20.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the prosecution's arguments against <i>Giglio</i> disclosure of non-testifying officers is far more expansive, but insofar as defense counsel has provided no evidence that the non-testifying officers played an integral role in the arrest and/or investigation of defendant, the Court can discern from the facts at bar that <i>Giglio</i> disclosure is not warranted for PO Kelly, Sgt. Espinosa, nor any other officers referenced in the motion (<i>see Peralta</i> at 954-955). </p>\n<p>However, the Court cannot divine the prosecution's compliance, so it must rely upon the record to determine whether the People have adhered, either quantitatively or qualitatively, to their discovery mandate concerning POs Mota-Alvarado and DeJesus (<i>see Bay,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 06407</span>, *22). Complying with the discovery statute is the People's obligation and the record at bar is devoid of evidence to sustain their burden. </p>\n<p>Accordingly, concerning Docket No.: CR-001749-23BX, the January arrest, the People's CoC, and supplemental CoC, filed on April 25, 2023, at 9:22 pm and 10:01 pm, respectively, are deemed INVALID.</p>\n<p>Additionally, concerning Docket No.: CR-002921-23BX, the February arrest, the People's CoC, filed on May 8, 2023, is also deemed INVALID.</p>\n<br><br><b><i>IV. The CPL \u00a7 30.30 Calculation</i></b>\n<p>In a motion to dismiss an accusatory instrument where the top charge is a misdemeanor, pursuant to CPL \u00a7 30.30 (1), defendant has the initial burden to demonstrate that the prosecution failed to declare readiness for trial within the statutorily prescribed time, ninety days (<i>see</i> CPL \u00a7 30.30 [1] [b]; <i>see also People v Flores</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">79 Misc 3d 1239</span>[A], <span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 NY Slip Op 50834</span>[U], *2 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 2023] citing <i>People v Galino</i>, 38 NY3d 199, 205 [Ct of App 2022]; <i>see also</i> CPL \u00a7 30.30 [4]).

Gomez, J.\n\n<p>In this action for foreclosure on a mortgage and the sale of the real property pledged as security, plaintiff moves for an order extending the time to conduct the sale of the mortgaged property prescribed by RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1). Plaintiff contends that a myriad of reasons beyond its control prevented a sale of the mortgaged premises within 90 days of the issuance of the judgment of foreclosure and sale. Defendant TEODORA MARGARITA RODRIGUEZ (Rodriguez) opposes the instant motion asserting that this action should be dismissed, thereby precluding the relief sought by plaintiff. To that end, Rodriguez cross-moves seeking to dismiss this action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c), asserting that plaintiff's failure to timely seek the entry of a default judgment against her warrants dismissal of this action.Plaintiff opposes Rodriguez' cross-motion, asserting, <i>inter alia</i>, that the relief requested is barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p>For the reasons that follow hereinafter, plaintiff's motion is granted and Rodriguez' cross-motion is denied.</p>\n<p>The instant action is for foreclosure on a mortgage and the sale of the real property which it encumbers. The complaint, filed on December 5, 2007, alleges that on May 26, 2006, [*2]Rodriguez executed a note between herself and plaintiff wherein Rodriguez agreed to repay a loan totaling $450,500. On the same day, as security for the foregoing loan, Rodriguez executed a mortgage, which pledged premises located at 1809 Phelan Place, Bronx, NY 10453 (1089) as security. Pursuant to the note, Rodriguez was required to repay the loan via monthly payments, each totaling $3,621.58. Per the note and mortgage, the failure to make a payment when due constituted a default. Pursuant to the note and mortgage, upon a default, plaintiff could initiate foreclosure proceedings. It is alleged that on July 1, 2007, Rodriguez defaulted by failing to make a payment then due. Based on the foregoing, plaintiff seeks a judgment allowing it to foreclose on the mortgage and sell 1089 and deeming plaintiff's copy of the mortgage an original.</p>\n<p>On August 3, 2009, the Court (Thomson, J.) granted plaintiff's unopposed application for the entry of a default judgment against all defendants and an order of reference.</p>\n<p>On January 8, 2016, the Court (Thompson, J.) granted plaintiff's unopposed application for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The motion was granted on default and without opposition.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 2018, Rodriguez filed a petition for bankruptcy <sup><b>[FN1]</b></sup>\n.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2018, the Court (Thompson, J.) marked Rodriguez' application seeking to, <i>inter alia</i>, cancel the sale of 1089 withdrawn.</p>\n<p>On August 12, 2019, the Court (Gonzalez, J.) denied Rodriguez' application pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 5015(a)(4) seeking to, <i>inter alia</i>, vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale and the order of reference. Saliently, Rodriguez argued that the Court never acquired jurisdiction over Rodriguez. In addressing the merits of the denial, the Court held that the \"issue of service was waived by [Rodriguez's] appearance by counsel in March 2018, in which [Rodriguez] moved for a stay and other relief, without raising the issue of personal jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>On January 11, 2022, the Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed the order issued by the Court (Gonzalez, J.), holding that vacatur of the order of reference and the judgment foreclosure and sale was properly denied, since Rodriguez's appearance was \"equivalent to personal service of the summons upon her\" (<i>U.S. Bank N.A. as Tr. for Holders of Specialty Underwriting and Residential Fin. Tr. , Mtge. Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-BC4 v Rodriguez</i>, 201 AD3d 493, 493 [1st Dept 2022]).</p>\n<p>On June 2, 2022, this Court granted plaintiff's unopposed application seeking to extend the time to conduct the sale of 1089 and extended the foregoing time by one year from the date of the order. </p>\n<p>On July 6, 2022, this Court amended the foregoing order, extending the time to conduct the sale of 1089 from one year thereof.</p>\n<br><br><b>PLAINTIFF'S MOTION</b>\n<p>Plaintiff's motion seeking an order extending the time to conduct the sale of 1089 is granted. Significantly, plaintiff establishes that since the delay in selling 1089 was occasioned by, <i>inter alia</i>, Rodriguez' conduct, an extension of the time to conduct the sale will not prejudice her.</p>\n<p>RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1) states that the</p>\n<blockquote>judgment shall direct that the mortgaged premises, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to discharge the mortgage debt, the expenses of the sale and the costs of the action, and which may be sold separately without material injury to the parties interested, be sold by or under the direction of the sheriff of the county, or a referee within ninety days of the date of the judgment.</blockquote><br><br>Thus, pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1), in a foreclosure action, a sale must be conducted within 90 days of the date of the judgment. \n<p>CPLR \u00a7 2004 states</p>\n<blockquote>[e]xcept where otherwise expressly prescribed by law, the court may extend the time fixed by any statute, rule or order for doing any act, upon such terms as may be just and upon good cause shown, whether the application for extension is made before or after the expiration of the time fixed.</blockquote><p>In determining whether to extend the time sought, the court should consider factors such as \"the length of the delay, whether the opposing party has been prejudiced by the delay, the reason given for the delay, whether the moving party was in default before seeking the extension, and, if so, the presence or absence of an affidavit of merit\" (<i>Tewari v Tsoutsouras</i>, 75 NY2d 1, 11-12 [1989]; <i>see Arias v First Presbyt. Church in Jamaica</i>, 97 AD3d 712, 712 [2d Dept 2012]; <i>Klughaupt v Hi-Tower Contractors, Inc.</i>, 64 AD3d 545, 546 [2d Dept 2009]). CPLR \u00a7 2004, by its express terms, does not extend times where other statutes prescribe mechanisms for extensions of the times prescribed therein (<i>Powers v Foley</i>, 25 AD2d 525, 525 [2d Dept 1966] [\"The Board is not bound to continue error in its interpretation of the law governing its powers. Nor does CPLR 2004 permit an extension of time to be granted to the petitioner; it applies to extensions of time for the doing of acts in actions and proceedings and not for the doing of acts which are substantive in character and provided for under other statutes.\"]).</p>\n<p>In addition to the orders discussed above, in support of the instant motion, plaintiff's counsel states that the sale could not be conducted after August 12, 2019, when the Court (Gonzalez, J.) lifted the stay precipitated by Rodriguez' motion seeking to vacate the order of reference and judgment of foreclosure and sale because of the Covid 19 pandemic <sup><b>[FN2]</b></sup>\n.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff submits two documents from the Public Access to Court Records website. The [*3]first evinces that on November 11, 2022, Rodriguez filed a bankruptcy petition. The second document evinces that on May 15, 2023, the bankruptcy was dismissed and all stays arising therefrom were lifted.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, plaintiff's application seeking to extend the time to conduct the sale of 1089 is granted. As noted above, the instant application is one pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 2004 and as such, in determining whether to extend the time sought, the court should consider factors such as \"the length of the delay, whether the opposing party has been prejudiced by the delay, the reason given for the delay, whether the moving party was in default before seeking the extension, and, if so, the presence or absence of an affidavit of merit\" (<i>Tewari</i> at 11-12 ;<i>see Arias</i> at 712; <i>Klughaupt</i> at 546). Here, it is clear that all delays in selling 1089 within the 90 days prescribed by RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1) and the time period prescribed by this Court's most recent order, dated July 7, 2022, were occasioned by Rodriguez' applications seeking to stay the sale, vacate the Court's prior orders, and have this action dismissed, the multiple bankruptcies filed by Rodriguez, and the regulations promulgating a stay in foreclosure actions precipitated by the Covid 19 pandemic. All of he foregoing actions and events were not precipitated by plaintiff and as a result, where as here, the Court has issued an order of reference defaulting all defendants, a final judgment of foreclosure and sale, and has denied Rodriguez' motion to vacate the same, Rodriguez' will not be prejudiced by the extension sought. </p>\n<p>Nothing urged by Rodriguez warrants denial of the instant motion and as will be discussed below, her application seeking to dismiss this action is wholly without merit and therefore, must be denied. </p>\n<br><br><b>RODRIGUEZ' CROSS-MOTION</b>\n<p>Rodriguez' cross-motion seeking to dismiss this action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c) is denied. Significantly, where as here, Rodriguez has defaulted and such default has been ratified by a subsequent order and appeal affirming the same, the law of the case doctrine, among other legal principles, precludes vacatur of the Court's order. </p>\n<p>It is well settled that unless there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction rendering it void, \"an order or judgment of a court is binding on all persons subject to its mandate until vacated or set aside on appeal (<i>Murray v Goord</i>, 298 AD2d 94, 97 [1st Dept 2002], <i>affd</i>, Matter of , 1 NY3d 29 [2003]; <i>see Hughes v Cuming</i>, 165 NY 91, 94 [1900]). </p>\n<p>To that end, the law of the case doctrine generally bars the re-litigation of a prior pre-judgment judicial determination made within the same action (<i>People v Evans</i>, 94 NY2d 499, 502 [2000]; <i>Brownrigg v New York City Housing Authority</i>, 29 AD3d 721, 722 [2d Dept 2006]). Judges of coordinate jurisdiction are thus prohibited from entertaining or deciding previously decided matters (<i>id</i>. at 503-504; <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp. v GA Insurance Company of New York</i>, 283 AD2d 295, 296 [1st Dept 2001]). Significantly,</p>\n<blockquote>[o]nce a point is decided within a case, the doctrine of the law of the case makes it binding not only on the parties, but on all other judges of coordinate jurisdiction. While the adoption of the Individual Assignment System has greatly attenuated reliance upon the doctrine, where an application on an issue is directed to different justices, the finality to be ascribed to the prior ruling becomes a paramount consideration</blockquote><br><br>(<i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296 [internal quotation marks omitted]). In certain instances, however, the doctrine is not absolute and its applicability is circumscribed. Accordingly, the [*4]doctrine is only applicable when parties seek to re-litigate issues that were previously resolved on the merits (<i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296), and where the parties were previously afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues being raised (<i>Evans at 502; Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296). Moreover, a previously decided issue can be re-litigated if there exist extraordinary circumstances or there is a change in law applicable to the issues previously decided (<i>Brownrigg</i> at 722; <i>Foley v Roche</i>, 86 AD2d 887, 887 [2d Dept 1982]).\n<p>Accordingly, once a prior a judge on a motion conclusively decides an issue, it becomes binding upon the proceedings thereafter. In <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp</i>, the court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment and held that defendants were obligated to provide the plaintiff with insurance coverage (<i>id.</i> at 296). Thereafter, at trial, when defendants sought to re-litigate the issue of coverage, the Court concluded that re-litigation of the issue of coverage was barred by the law of the case doctrine (<i>id</i>. at 296).</p>\n<p>Significantly, however, when motions for summary judgment result in denials of the same premised upon issues of fact precluding such relief, such decision does not preclude the re-litigation of summary judgment at trial or thereafter, since no conclusive finding has been made so as to trigger the law of the case doctrine (<i>Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Inc. v 214 East 49th Street Corp.</i>, 218 AD2d 464, 468 [1st Dept 1996][\"The dissent is correct when it notes that this case was tried upon the supposition that the pretrial decision denying both parties' respective motions for summary judgment (Altman, J.) had narrowed the issues at trial, and that the quantum of plaintiff's brokerage services, however slight, was not in controversy before the trial court. Indeed, there was never any dispute as to the two brief visits made by plaintiff's salesman to defendant. But we are unable to conclude that the outcome of the parties' motion practice was to relieve plaintiff of its obligation to establish a prima facie case, or its obligation, if it were ultimately to prevail, to prove its case by a preponderance of the credible evidence. This Court, of course, is not bound by the doctrine of 'law of the case' made on pretrial motions in reviewing a full record after trial.\"]; <i>Sackman-Gilliland Corporation v Senator Holding Group Corp.</i>, 43 AD2d 948, 949 [2d Dept 1974] [\"A denial of a motion for summary judgment is not necessarily res judicata or the law of the case that there is an issue of fact in the case that will be established at the trial.\"]).</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, Rodriguez' motion must be denied since it is wholly devoid of merit. </p>\n<p>First, to the extent that Rodriguez seeks to dismiss the instant action, without first moving to vacate the order of reference, which granted a default judgment against her, she is precluded from seeking the affirmative relief of dismissal (<i>Holubar v Holubar</i>, 89 AD3d 802, 802 [2d Dept 2011] [\"In granting the defendant's untimely motion to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against her, the Supreme Court improperly, in effect, excused the defendant's default in the absence of a request for such relief\"]; <i>McGee v Dunn</i>, 75 AD3d 624, 625 [2d Dept 2010] [\"Under such circumstances, the Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in granting the defendant's untimely motion to dismiss the complaint, as it, in effect, excused the defendant's default in the absence of a request for such relief.\"]; <i>May v Hartsdale Manor Owners Corp.</i>, 73 AD3d 713 [2d Dept 2010] [\"Here, the defendant CDT Real Estate Management Corp. (hereinafter CDT) attempted to place the blame for its default in answering upon its insurance company. However, CDT already was in default by the time it finally forwarded the summons [*5]and complaint to its insurance broker, and CDT failed to offer any explanation for this delay. Accordingly, it was an improvident exercise of discretion to excuse the default of CDT, and to extend its time to serve an answer in the absence of a cross motion for such relief.\"]; <i>Hosten v Oladapo</i>, 44 AD3d 1006, 1006 [2d Dept 2007] [\"Although the plaintiff failed to demonstrate his entitlement to a default judgment, the court erred in deeming the defendant's answer timely filed and served in the absence of a cross motion for this relief and without the necessary showing of a reasonable excuse for the default and a meritorious defense.\"]). </p>\n<p>Here, the Court (Thompson, J.) held that Rodriguez had defaulted and entered a judgment against her. Thereafter, the Court (Gonzalez, J.), denied Rodriguez' application to vacate Rodriguez' default and, <i>inter alia</i>, the order of reference, which promulgated the same. The foregoing order was appealed and affirmed (<i>U.S. Bank N.A. as Tr. for Holders of Specialty Underwriting and Residential Fin. Tr. , Mtge. Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-BC4</i> at 493). Accordingly, until the order of reference is vacated, relief not sought by Rodriguez, she is precluded from seeking affirmative relief.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the Court reached the merits of the instant application, the relief sought is precluded by the law of the case, which, here, is that Rodriguez defaulted in answering. By implication, this holding also means that the instant action did not warrant dismissal, as urged, pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c). As noted above, the law of the case doctrine generally bars the re-litigation of a prior pre-judgment judicial determination made within the same action (<i>People</i> at 502; <i>Brownrigg</i> at 722). Accordingly, judges of coordinate jurisdiction are thus prohibited from entertaining or deciding previously decided matters (<i>id</i>. at 503-504; <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296). Here, dismissal of the action, as urged by Rodriguez, would require overruling a judge of this Court, which, of course, the law prohibits.</p>\n<p>Lastly, while Rodriguez could have conceivably sought to reargue <sup><b>[FN3]</b></sup>\n the Court's (Gonzalez J.) order, dated August 12, 2019, which denied her application to, <i>inter alia</i>, vacate her default, while concomitantly seeking to dismiss this action on the grounds asserted in her cross-motion, the decision by the Appellate Division, First Department affirming the Court's order now precludes such relief. Indeed, Rodriguez would have to seek reargument of the Appellate Division's decision. To the extent that Rodriguez could have sought reargument at the Appellate [*6]Division, such relief had to be sought within 30 days of the service of that order upon her (22 NYCRR 1250.16 [\"A motion for reargument of or leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals from an order of the court shall be made within 30 days after service of the order of the court with notice of entry.\"]). Here, procedurally, while the Court's file is bereft of a Notice of Entry to which the Appellate Division's decision is appended, Rodriguez could conceivably still seek reargument of the Appellate Division's decision <sup><b>[FN4]</b></sup>\n. As a matter of substance, however, it is unlikely that the Appellate Division would rule in Rodriguez' favor, since per the decision by the Appellate Division, it is clear that Rodriguez waived her personal jurisdiction defense and failed to timely answer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as urged by plaintiff, on this record, Rodriguez waived her right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c) (<i>Bank of Am., N.A. v Carapella</i>, 218 AD3d 631, 633 [2d Dept 2023] [\"It is well settled that a defendant can waive the right to seek dismissal of an action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c). A defendant may waive the right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by his or her conduct. Here, the defendant did not move pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him until nearly three years after the defendant's attorney filed a notice of appearance on his behalf. Under these circumstances, the defendant waived his right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by his active participation in the litigation\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]; <i>U.S. Bank N.A. v Nur</i>, 208 AD3d 709, 709 [2d Dept 2022] [\"In any event, although the defendant and nonparty Eleven Forty, Inc., opposed the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment and for an order of reference by requesting that, pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c), the complaint be dismissed insofar as asserted against the defendant as abandoned, as the Supreme Court determined, the right to seek dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) was waived.\"]; <i>Bank of Am., N.A. v Lichter</i>, 192 AD3d 957, 957 [2d Dept 2021] [\"Here, the defendants waived their right to seek dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by filing a notice of appearance in 2016.\"]; <i>U.S. Rof III Legal Tit.

Here, John's cross motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) was made nearly two years after John's attorney filed a notice of [*7]appearance on her behalf. Under these circumstances, John waived her right to seek CPLR 3215 (c) dismissal by her active participation in the litigation\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).].</p>\n<p>Here, as both the Court (Gonzalez, J.) and the Appellate Division held, Rodriguez filed a notice of appearance in this action on March 2018, which constituted a waiver of any personal jurisdiction defense. Moreover, as relevant here, even if this Court could reach the merits of Rodriguez' application for dismissal of the action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c), the instant cross-motion is made more than five years after Rodriguez filed her notice of appearance and more than four years after she moved to dismiss this action on completely different grounds, thereby actively participating in the action and abandoning entitlement to the instant relief. Accordingly, the instant motion, even if considered, would be denied on grounds of waiver (<i>Bank of Am., N.A. </i>at 633; <i>U.S. Bank N.A.</i> at 709; <i>Bank of Am., N.A.</i> at 957; <i>U.S. Rof III Legal Tit.

Gomez, J.\n\n<p>In this action for foreclosure on a mortgage and the sale of the real property pledged as security, plaintiff moves for an order extending the time to conduct the sale of the mortgaged property prescribed by RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1). Plaintiff contends that a myriad of reasons beyond its control prevented a sale of the mortgaged premises within 90 days of the issuance of the judgment of foreclosure and sale. Defendant TEODORA MARGARITA RODRIGUEZ (Rodriguez) opposes the instant motion asserting that this action should be dismissed, thereby precluding the relief sought by plaintiff. To that end, Rodriguez cross-moves seeking to dismiss this action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c), asserting that plaintiff's failure to timely seek the entry of a default judgment against her warrants dismissal of this action.Plaintiff opposes Rodriguez' cross-motion, asserting, <i>inter alia</i>, that the relief requested is barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p>For the reasons that follow hereinafter, plaintiff's motion is granted and Rodriguez' cross-motion is denied.</p>\n<p>The instant action is for foreclosure on a mortgage and the sale of the real property which it encumbers. The complaint, filed on December 5, 2007, alleges that on May 26, 2006, [*2]Rodriguez executed a note between herself and plaintiff wherein Rodriguez agreed to repay a loan totaling $450,500. On the same day, as security for the foregoing loan, Rodriguez executed a mortgage, which pledged premises located at 1809 Phelan Place, Bronx, NY 10453 (1089) as security. Pursuant to the note, Rodriguez was required to repay the loan via monthly payments, each totaling $3,621.58. Per the note and mortgage, the failure to make a payment when due constituted a default. Pursuant to the note and mortgage, upon a default, plaintiff could initiate foreclosure proceedings. It is alleged that on July 1, 2007, Rodriguez defaulted by failing to make a payment then due. Based on the foregoing, plaintiff seeks a judgment allowing it to foreclose on the mortgage and sell 1089 and deeming plaintiff's copy of the mortgage an original.</p>\n<p>On August 3, 2009, the Court (Thomson, J.) granted plaintiff's unopposed application for the entry of a default judgment against all defendants and an order of reference.</p>\n<p>On January 8, 2016, the Court (Thompson, J.) granted plaintiff's unopposed application for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The motion was granted on default and without opposition.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 2018, Rodriguez filed a petition for bankruptcy <sup><b>[FN1]</b></sup>\n.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2018, the Court (Thompson, J.) marked Rodriguez' application seeking to, <i>inter alia</i>, cancel the sale of 1089 withdrawn.</p>\n<p>On August 12, 2019, the Court (Gonzalez, J.) denied Rodriguez' application pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 5015(a)(4) seeking to, <i>inter alia</i>, vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale and the order of reference. Saliently, Rodriguez argued that the Court never acquired jurisdiction over Rodriguez. In addressing the merits of the denial, the Court held that the \"issue of service was waived by [Rodriguez's] appearance by counsel in March 2018, in which [Rodriguez] moved for a stay and other relief, without raising the issue of personal jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>On January 11, 2022, the Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed the order issued by the Court (Gonzalez, J.), holding that vacatur of the order of reference and the judgment foreclosure and sale was properly denied, since Rodriguez's appearance was \"equivalent to personal service of the summons upon her\" (<i>U.S. Bank N.A. as Tr. for Holders of Specialty Underwriting and Residential Fin. Tr. , Mtge. Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-BC4 v Rodriguez</i>, 201 AD3d 493, 493 [1st Dept 2022]).</p>\n<p>On June 2, 2022, this Court granted plaintiff's unopposed application seeking to extend the time to conduct the sale of 1089 and extended the foregoing time by one year from the date of the order. </p>\n<p>On July 6, 2022, this Court amended the foregoing order, extending the time to conduct the sale of 1089 from one year thereof.</p>\n<br><br><b>PLAINTIFF'S MOTION</b>\n<p>Plaintiff's motion seeking an order extending the time to conduct the sale of 1089 is granted. Significantly, plaintiff establishes that since the delay in selling 1089 was occasioned by, <i>inter alia</i>, Rodriguez' conduct, an extension of the time to conduct the sale will not prejudice her.</p>\n<p>RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1) states that the</p>\n<blockquote>judgment shall direct that the mortgaged premises, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to discharge the mortgage debt, the expenses of the sale and the costs of the action, and which may be sold separately without material injury to the parties interested, be sold by or under the direction of the sheriff of the county, or a referee within ninety days of the date of the judgment.</blockquote><br><br>Thus, pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1), in a foreclosure action, a sale must be conducted within 90 days of the date of the judgment. \n<p>CPLR \u00a7 2004 states</p>\n<blockquote>[e]xcept where otherwise expressly prescribed by law, the court may extend the time fixed by any statute, rule or order for doing any act, upon such terms as may be just and upon good cause shown, whether the application for extension is made before or after the expiration of the time fixed.</blockquote><p>In determining whether to extend the time sought, the court should consider factors such as \"the length of the delay, whether the opposing party has been prejudiced by the delay, the reason given for the delay, whether the moving party was in default before seeking the extension, and, if so, the presence or absence of an affidavit of merit\" (<i>Tewari v Tsoutsouras</i>, 75 NY2d 1, 11-12 [1989]; <i>see Arias v First Presbyt. Church in Jamaica</i>, 97 AD3d 712, 712 [2d Dept 2012]; <i>Klughaupt v Hi-Tower Contractors, Inc.</i>, 64 AD3d 545, 546 [2d Dept 2009]). CPLR \u00a7 2004, by its express terms, does not extend times where other statutes prescribe mechanisms for extensions of the times prescribed therein (<i>Powers v Foley</i>, 25 AD2d 525, 525 [2d Dept 1966] [\"The Board is not bound to continue error in its interpretation of the law governing its powers. Nor does CPLR 2004 permit an extension of time to be granted to the petitioner; it applies to extensions of time for the doing of acts in actions and proceedings and not for the doing of acts which are substantive in character and provided for under other statutes.\"]).</p>\n<p>In addition to the orders discussed above, in support of the instant motion, plaintiff's counsel states that the sale could not be conducted after August 12, 2019, when the Court (Gonzalez, J.) lifted the stay precipitated by Rodriguez' motion seeking to vacate the order of reference and judgment of foreclosure and sale because of the Covid 19 pandemic <sup><b>[FN2]</b></sup>\n.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff submits two documents from the Public Access to Court Records website. The [*3]first evinces that on November 11, 2022, Rodriguez filed a bankruptcy petition. The second document evinces that on May 15, 2023, the bankruptcy was dismissed and all stays arising therefrom were lifted.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, plaintiff's application seeking to extend the time to conduct the sale of 1089 is granted. As noted above, the instant application is one pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 2004 and as such, in determining whether to extend the time sought, the court should consider factors such as \"the length of the delay, whether the opposing party has been prejudiced by the delay, the reason given for the delay, whether the moving party was in default before seeking the extension, and, if so, the presence or absence of an affidavit of merit\" (<i>Tewari</i> at 11-12 ;<i>see Arias</i> at 712; <i>Klughaupt</i> at 546). Here, it is clear that all delays in selling 1089 within the 90 days prescribed by RPAPL \u00a7 1351(1) and the time period prescribed by this Court's most recent order, dated July 7, 2022, were occasioned by Rodriguez' applications seeking to stay the sale, vacate the Court's prior orders, and have this action dismissed, the multiple bankruptcies filed by Rodriguez, and the regulations promulgating a stay in foreclosure actions precipitated by the Covid 19 pandemic. All of he foregoing actions and events were not precipitated by plaintiff and as a result, where as here, the Court has issued an order of reference defaulting all defendants, a final judgment of foreclosure and sale, and has denied Rodriguez' motion to vacate the same, Rodriguez' will not be prejudiced by the extension sought. </p>\n<p>Nothing urged by Rodriguez warrants denial of the instant motion and as will be discussed below, her application seeking to dismiss this action is wholly without merit and therefore, must be denied. </p>\n<br><br><b>RODRIGUEZ' CROSS-MOTION</b>\n<p>Rodriguez' cross-motion seeking to dismiss this action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c) is denied. Significantly, where as here, Rodriguez has defaulted and such default has been ratified by a subsequent order and appeal affirming the same, the law of the case doctrine, among other legal principles, precludes vacatur of the Court's order. </p>\n<p>It is well settled that unless there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction rendering it void, \"an order or judgment of a court is binding on all persons subject to its mandate until vacated or set aside on appeal (<i>Murray v Goord</i>, 298 AD2d 94, 97 [1st Dept 2002], <i>affd</i>, Matter of , 1 NY3d 29 [2003]; <i>see Hughes v Cuming</i>, 165 NY 91, 94 [1900]). </p>\n<p>To that end, the law of the case doctrine generally bars the re-litigation of a prior pre-judgment judicial determination made within the same action (<i>People v Evans</i>, 94 NY2d 499, 502 [2000]; <i>Brownrigg v New York City Housing Authority</i>, 29 AD3d 721, 722 [2d Dept 2006]). Judges of coordinate jurisdiction are thus prohibited from entertaining or deciding previously decided matters (<i>id</i>. at 503-504; <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp. v GA Insurance Company of New York</i>, 283 AD2d 295, 296 [1st Dept 2001]). Significantly,</p>\n<blockquote>[o]nce a point is decided within a case, the doctrine of the law of the case makes it binding not only on the parties, but on all other judges of coordinate jurisdiction. While the adoption of the Individual Assignment System has greatly attenuated reliance upon the doctrine, where an application on an issue is directed to different justices, the finality to be ascribed to the prior ruling becomes a paramount consideration</blockquote><br><br>(<i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296 [internal quotation marks omitted]). In certain instances, however, the doctrine is not absolute and its applicability is circumscribed. Accordingly, the [*4]doctrine is only applicable when parties seek to re-litigate issues that were previously resolved on the merits (<i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296), and where the parties were previously afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues being raised (<i>Evans at 502; Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296). Moreover, a previously decided issue can be re-litigated if there exist extraordinary circumstances or there is a change in law applicable to the issues previously decided (<i>Brownrigg</i> at 722; <i>Foley v Roche</i>, 86 AD2d 887, 887 [2d Dept 1982]).\n<p>Accordingly, once a prior a judge on a motion conclusively decides an issue, it becomes binding upon the proceedings thereafter. In <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp</i>, the court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment and held that defendants were obligated to provide the plaintiff with insurance coverage (<i>id.</i> at 296). Thereafter, at trial, when defendants sought to re-litigate the issue of coverage, the Court concluded that re-litigation of the issue of coverage was barred by the law of the case doctrine (<i>id</i>. at 296).</p>\n<p>Significantly, however, when motions for summary judgment result in denials of the same premised upon issues of fact precluding such relief, such decision does not preclude the re-litigation of summary judgment at trial or thereafter, since no conclusive finding has been made so as to trigger the law of the case doctrine (<i>Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Inc. v 214 East 49th Street Corp.</i>, 218 AD2d 464, 468 [1st Dept 1996][\"The dissent is correct when it notes that this case was tried upon the supposition that the pretrial decision denying both parties' respective motions for summary judgment (Altman, J.) had narrowed the issues at trial, and that the quantum of plaintiff's brokerage services, however slight, was not in controversy before the trial court. Indeed, there was never any dispute as to the two brief visits made by plaintiff's salesman to defendant. But we are unable to conclude that the outcome of the parties' motion practice was to relieve plaintiff of its obligation to establish a prima facie case, or its obligation, if it were ultimately to prevail, to prove its case by a preponderance of the credible evidence. This Court, of course, is not bound by the doctrine of 'law of the case' made on pretrial motions in reviewing a full record after trial.\"]; <i>Sackman-Gilliland Corporation v Senator Holding Group Corp.</i>, 43 AD2d 948, 949 [2d Dept 1974] [\"A denial of a motion for summary judgment is not necessarily res judicata or the law of the case that there is an issue of fact in the case that will be established at the trial.\"]).</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, Rodriguez' motion must be denied since it is wholly devoid of merit. </p>\n<p>First, to the extent that Rodriguez seeks to dismiss the instant action, without first moving to vacate the order of reference, which granted a default judgment against her, she is precluded from seeking the affirmative relief of dismissal (<i>Holubar v Holubar</i>, 89 AD3d 802, 802 [2d Dept 2011] [\"In granting the defendant's untimely motion to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against her, the Supreme Court improperly, in effect, excused the defendant's default in the absence of a request for such relief\"]; <i>McGee v Dunn</i>, 75 AD3d 624, 625 [2d Dept 2010] [\"Under such circumstances, the Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in granting the defendant's untimely motion to dismiss the complaint, as it, in effect, excused the defendant's default in the absence of a request for such relief.\"]; <i>May v Hartsdale Manor Owners Corp.</i>, 73 AD3d 713 [2d Dept 2010] [\"Here, the defendant CDT Real Estate Management Corp. (hereinafter CDT) attempted to place the blame for its default in answering upon its insurance company. However, CDT already was in default by the time it finally forwarded the summons [*5]and complaint to its insurance broker, and CDT failed to offer any explanation for this delay. Accordingly, it was an improvident exercise of discretion to excuse the default of CDT, and to extend its time to serve an answer in the absence of a cross motion for such relief.\"]; <i>Hosten v Oladapo</i>, 44 AD3d 1006, 1006 [2d Dept 2007] [\"Although the plaintiff failed to demonstrate his entitlement to a default judgment, the court erred in deeming the defendant's answer timely filed and served in the absence of a cross motion for this relief and without the necessary showing of a reasonable excuse for the default and a meritorious defense.\"]). </p>\n<p>Here, the Court (Thompson, J.) held that Rodriguez had defaulted and entered a judgment against her. Thereafter, the Court (Gonzalez, J.), denied Rodriguez' application to vacate Rodriguez' default and, <i>inter alia</i>, the order of reference, which promulgated the same. The foregoing order was appealed and affirmed (<i>U.S. Bank N.A. as Tr. for Holders of Specialty Underwriting and Residential Fin. Tr. , Mtge. Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-BC4</i> at 493). Accordingly, until the order of reference is vacated, relief not sought by Rodriguez, she is precluded from seeking affirmative relief.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the Court reached the merits of the instant application, the relief sought is precluded by the law of the case, which, here, is that Rodriguez defaulted in answering. By implication, this holding also means that the instant action did not warrant dismissal, as urged, pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c). As noted above, the law of the case doctrine generally bars the re-litigation of a prior pre-judgment judicial determination made within the same action (<i>People</i> at 502; <i>Brownrigg</i> at 722). Accordingly, judges of coordinate jurisdiction are thus prohibited from entertaining or deciding previously decided matters (<i>id</i>. at 503-504; <i>Gee Tai Chong Realty Corp.</i> at 296). Here, dismissal of the action, as urged by Rodriguez, would require overruling a judge of this Court, which, of course, the law prohibits.</p>\n<p>Lastly, while Rodriguez could have conceivably sought to reargue <sup><b>[FN3]</b></sup>\n the Court's (Gonzalez J.) order, dated August 12, 2019, which denied her application to, <i>inter alia</i>, vacate her default, while concomitantly seeking to dismiss this action on the grounds asserted in her cross-motion, the decision by the Appellate Division, First Department affirming the Court's order now precludes such relief. Indeed, Rodriguez would have to seek reargument of the Appellate Division's decision. To the extent that Rodriguez could have sought reargument at the Appellate [*6]Division, such relief had to be sought within 30 days of the service of that order upon her (22 NYCRR 1250.16 [\"A motion for reargument of or leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals from an order of the court shall be made within 30 days after service of the order of the court with notice of entry.\"]). Here, procedurally, while the Court's file is bereft of a Notice of Entry to which the Appellate Division's decision is appended, Rodriguez could conceivably still seek reargument of the Appellate Division's decision <sup><b>[FN4]</b></sup>\n. As a matter of substance, however, it is unlikely that the Appellate Division would rule in Rodriguez' favor, since per the decision by the Appellate Division, it is clear that Rodriguez waived her personal jurisdiction defense and failed to timely answer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as urged by plaintiff, on this record, Rodriguez waived her right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c) (<i>Bank of Am., N.A. v Carapella</i>, 218 AD3d 631, 633 [2d Dept 2023] [\"It is well settled that a defendant can waive the right to seek dismissal of an action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c). A defendant may waive the right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by his or her conduct. Here, the defendant did not move pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him until nearly three years after the defendant's attorney filed a notice of appearance on his behalf. Under these circumstances, the defendant waived his right to seek dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by his active participation in the litigation\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]; <i>U.S. Bank N.A. v Nur</i>, 208 AD3d 709, 709 [2d Dept 2022] [\"In any event, although the defendant and nonparty Eleven Forty, Inc., opposed the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment and for an order of reference by requesting that, pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c), the complaint be dismissed insofar as asserted against the defendant as abandoned, as the Supreme Court determined, the right to seek dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) was waived.\"]; <i>Bank of Am., N.A. v Lichter</i>, 192 AD3d 957, 957 [2d Dept 2021] [\"Here, the defendants waived their right to seek dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) by filing a notice of appearance in 2016.\"]; <i>U.S. Rof III Legal Tit.

Here, John's cross motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3215 (c) was made nearly two years after John's attorney filed a notice of [*7]appearance on her behalf. Under these circumstances, John waived her right to seek CPLR 3215 (c) dismissal by her active participation in the litigation\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).].</p>\n<p>Here, as both the Court (Gonzalez, J.) and the Appellate Division held, Rodriguez filed a notice of appearance in this action on March 2018, which constituted a waiver of any personal jurisdiction defense. Moreover, as relevant here, even if this Court could reach the merits of Rodriguez' application for dismissal of the action pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3215(c), the instant cross-motion is made more than five years after Rodriguez filed her notice of appearance and more than four years after she moved to dismiss this action on completely different grounds, thereby actively participating in the action and abandoning entitlement to the instant relief. Accordingly, the instant motion, even if considered, would be denied on grounds of waiver (<i>Bank of Am., N.A. </i>at 633; <i>U.S. Bank N.A.</i> at 709; <i>Bank of Am., N.A.</i> at 957; <i>U.S. Rof III Legal Tit.

The circuit court\n\n     dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action.\n\n     See 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2020). For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in\n\n     part.\n\n\u00b62                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63                                         A. Original Complaint\n\n\u00b64           In October 2020, Stop NorthPoint, LLC, along with 17 individuals, filed suit to prevent the\n\n     City from annexing, and East Gate from developing, 1262 acres of unincorporated land in Will\n\n     County between the villages of Elwood and Manhattan. Plaintiffs alleged that East Gate\u2019s\n\n                                                      2\n\f     proposed development, an industrial business park (NorthPoint Development) complete with\n\n     warehouses and truck terminals, would constitute a public and private nuisance and that\n\n     defendant\u2019s preannexation agreement providing for the development was null and void. Thereafter,\n\n     plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming 18 additional plaintiffs. They also moved for a\n\n     temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the City from holding two\n\n     hearings scheduled for December 2020 regarding the preannexation agreement. The circuit court\n\n     denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\n\n\u00b65          Defendants executed an annexation and development agreement (annexation agreement)\n\n     following the second December 2020 hearing. The annexation agreement provided that East Gate\n\n     intends to develop a multi-phased light industrial business park on primarily vacant land within\n\n     three miles of two major intermodal facilities. The agreement acknowledged the presence of \u201clittle\n\n     residential property in close proximity to the Property\u201d and stated that the NorthPoint Development\n\n     \u201cis specifically designed to minimize its impact on the surrounding community, and to decrease\n\n     the current amount of truck traffic on Illinois Route 53 and other local roads outside of the park by\n\n     a variety of features described herein, including bridges and a closed loop truck network.\u201d In\n\n     addition to its annexation and zoning provisions, the agreement provided for, inter alia, road\n\n     improvements, a closed loop truck network, sewer and water systems, residential buffers,\n\n     subdivision applications, and community enhancement contributions. It included a \u201ctime is of the\n\n     essence\u201d clause and provided for a 20-year term.\n\n\u00b66                                    B. Second Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b67          In March 2021, plaintiffs filed a 10-count second amended complaint naming 20 additional\n\n     plaintiffs, for a total of 56. Aside from Stop NorthPoint, LLC, which was formed to oppose the\n\n     NorthPoint Development, plaintiffs are primarily military veterans organizations and individuals\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f     (many veterans themselves) who own property or reside in Will County. Some have family or\n\n     friends interred in the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, a national shrine located southwest of\n\n     the proposed development. Some own property near or contiguous to the proposed development.\n\n     The second amended complaint alleges, most notably, that the proposed development will\n\n     constitute a nuisance, the annexation agreement is void, and the City conducted the December\n\n     2020 hearings without proper notice and in violation of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1\n\n     et seq. (West 2020)).\n\n\u00b68          In April 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to\n\n     section 2-619.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2-619.1 (West 2020)). After\n\n     briefing and an oral argument, the circuit court issued a written order in July 2021 granting\n\n     defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, though without prejudice as to any\n\n     specific, identifiable private nuisance claim an individual plaintiff may acquire in the future.\n\n\u00b69          In August 2021, plaintiffs moved to reconsider and, in the alternative, for leave to file a\n\n     third amended complaint. After their motion was fully briefed, plaintiffs learned the City\u2019s plan\n\n     commission intended to hold a public hearing in November 2021 to address an amended\n\n     annexation agreement which plaintiffs believed could moot part of the second amended complaint\n\n     and give rise to new causes of action. Plaintiffs asked the court to stay its ruling on the motion to\n\n     reconsider until after the plan commission\u2019s meeting. The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request and\n\n     ultimately granted plaintiff leave to file a third amended complaint. In December 2021, defendants\n\n     executed the amended annexation agreement following a public hearing. 1 Plaintiffs filed a third\n\n     amended complaint in February 2022.\n\n\n\n\n            1\n              The amended agreement largely retained the provisions of the original annexation agreement as\n     stated in paragraph five of this opinion.\n                                                       4\n\f\u00b6 10                                     C. Third Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b6 11                                       1. Allegations and Exhibits\n\n\u00b6 12           Plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint contains the five counts at issue in this appeal. Counts\n\n       I and II form the gravamen of the third amended complaint. Under those counts, plaintiffs allege\n\n       that, if allowed to proceed, the NorthPoint Development would constitute a private nuisance (count\n\n       I) and a public nuisance (count II). The complaint cites a 2020 traffic impact study commissioned\n\n       by the Village of Manhattan indicating that \u201cat full build-out, the Development will generate an\n\n       additional 10,370 trucks per day.\u201d This figure, plaintiffs allege, is a conservative estimate.\n\n\u00b6 13           In support of their private and public nuisance claims, plaintiffs allege that constant truck\n\n       traffic will (1) cause noise, vibration, pollution, and harm to the environment; (2) interfere with\n\n       the dignity, serenity, and quiet of the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery; (3) endanger\n\n       pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers; (4) generate noxious exhaust and diesel fumes harmful to\n\n       public health and to wildlife, wetlands, and streams; (5) deteriorate streets and necessarily increase\n\n       property taxes to cover repairs; (6) lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and cause constant noise and\n\n       vibrations rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable; (7) produce vibrations likely to\n\n       cause damage to nearby homes, property, and structures; (8) increase plaintiffs\u2019 travel times; and\n\n       (9) lead to a rise in semi-truck crash incidents and collisions with wildlife. Count II additionally\n\n       alleges the proposed development will constitute a public nuisance under the City\u2019s municipal\n\n       code.\n\n\u00b6 14           Count III, brought as a purported taxpayer claim, alleges the new annexation agreement is\n\n       null and void, and unenforceable for vagueness and indefiniteness.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f\u00b6 15          Count IV alleges the November 2021 plan commission hearing was constitutionally\n\n       deficient due to a notice fraught with deficiencies and inaccuracies relating to parcel index numbers\n\n       (PINs), legal descriptions, and acreage.\n\n\u00b6 16          Count V alleges violations of the Open Meetings Act based on the City\u2019s failure to require\n\n       face masks at the November and December 2021 plan commission hearings despite a state-wide\n\n       individual mask mandate and despite the risk that attendees would contract the Omicron variant of\n\n       COVID-19.\n\n\u00b6 17          All counts include a request for (1) a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining\n\n       defendants from developing the proposed industrial business park, (2) a declaratory judgment that\n\n       the annexation agreement is void and the annexation is unlawful, and (3) attorney fees and costs.\n\n\u00b6 18          Plaintiffs attached the following exhibits to their complaint: (1) defendants\u2019 amended\n\n       annexation agreement, (2) a letter to the Village of Elwood from the Department of Veterans\n\n       Affairs-National Cemetery Administration, expressing            concerns about the NorthPoint\n\n       Development, (3) traffic crash reports involving truck drivers causing property damage to the\n\n       Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, (4) a research study finding that older Americans who\n\n       regularly breathe even low levels of air pollution face an increased mortality risk, (5) a resolution\n\n       passed by the City of Edgerton, Kansas, to issue $500 million in industrial revenue bonds to fund\n\n       the second development phase of a logistics park similar to the NorthPoint Development, (6) a\n\n       public health study predicting 1900 premature deaths and $17 billion in social costs nationwide\n\n       due to emissions attributable to traffic congestion, and (7) the public hearing notice for the City\u2019s\n\n       November 2021 plan commission hearing.\n\n\u00b6 19                                          2. Motion to Dismiss\n\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f\u00b6 20          In March 2022, defendants filed a combined motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619.1\n\n       of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2-619.1 (West 2022)). Under section 2-615, they argued that all five\n\n       counts failed to allege sufficient facts to support any cause of action. Under section 2-619,\n\n       defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 standing under counts I (private nuisance) and III (annexation\n\n       agreement validity). As to count I, defendants argued that, except for a few plaintiffs who allegedly\n\n       own property contiguous to the proposed development, none of the plaintiffs have standing to\n\n       bring a claim for private nuisance. As to count III, defendants argued plaintiffs had no standing to\n\n       challenge the annexation agreement\u2019s enforceability and, moreover, contract enforceability does\n\n       not provide a basis for a taxpayer suit.\n\n\u00b6 21          In response, plaintiffs argued defendants\u2019 section 2-615 argument attempted to hold\n\n       plaintiffs to an \u201cimpossible pleading standard.\u201d Plaintiffs maintained they had standing to raise\n\n       their claims and emphasized defendants were \u201ctrying to push through this gargantuan trucking and\n\n       warehouse development without even a traffic or environmental study.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 22                              3. Environmental Consultation Requirement\n\n\u00b6 23          After briefing and oral argument, the court took the matter under advisement and directed\n\n       the parties to submit any law with respect to the necessity of an environmental impact study. Upon\n\n       receiving the parties\u2019 submissions, the court found that \u201cissues should be considered with regards\n\n       to the provisions of the Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30/17) and *** McHenry\n\n       County Defenders v. City of Harvard, 384 Ill. App. 3d 265 (2008).\u201d In July 2022, the court allowed\n\n       plaintiffs to file a fourth amended complaint restating the third amended complaint \u201cin full as it\n\n       exists now\u201d and adding any counts to address issues concerning the Illinois Natural Areas\n\n       Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30/1 et seq. (West 2022)). The court further stated that the parties\u2019\n\n       arguments concerning defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cshall stand as a fully briefed and argued\n\n\n                                                        7\n\f       Motion to Dismiss those counts that are restated in the Fourth Amended Complaint, with ruling as\n\n       to those counts to remain pending.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24           Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint maintaining the existing five counts\n\n       and adding a sixth count, which sought a writ of mandamus directing the City to engage in\n\n       environmental consultations with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. On defendants\u2019\n\n       motion, the court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s mandamus claim (count VI) for mootness, finding the City\n\n       had completed the environmental consultation process demanded by plaintiffs. Count VI is not at\n\n       issue in this appeal.\n\n\u00b6 25                                       D. Circuit Court Decision\n\n\u00b6 26           In September 2022, the circuit court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I through\n\n       V of the fourth amended complaint, which had \u201crestated verbatim the 5 Counts of the Third\n\n       Amended Complaint and added Count VI seeking Mandamus.\u201d The court entered a written ruling\n\n       in which it found count I (private nuisance) improperly \u201clumps Plaintiffs that have distinct rights\n\n       and interests into a single group.\u201d Observing the nonuniform impact of noise and exhaust\n\n       emissions on plaintiffs and that \u201csafety will vary greatly based on proximity,\u201d the court dismissed\n\n       count I \u201cwithout prejudice as to any future individual nuisance claim any Plaintiff may acquire\n\n       when a parcel in the annexed area threatens or creates a specific identifiable and measurable\n\n       nuisance use on the parcel.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 27           The court found the nuisance allegations failed to state a cause of action for prospective\n\n       nuisance, whether private or public. In particular, the court found that while plaintiffs alleged the\n\n       proposed development would substantially increase truck traffic, \u201ca proposed or contemplated\n\n       time for completing build-out is not alleged and frankly is not known.\u201d It further stated, \u201cThe\n\n       complaint is describing conditions at an undetermined point in the future which by the nature of\n\n\n                                                        8\n\f       the development remains several years away.\u201d The court found, accordingly, that \u201c[t]he threat of\n\n       future high volume truck traffic is not supported by any factual allegations showing that the threat\n\n       is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u00b6 28          Further, in dismissing count II (public nuisance), the court opined that, due to the operation\n\n       of a nearby intermodal facility, truck traffic was likely to increase even if the proposed\n\n       development was enjoined. The court emphasized the need for benchmark data to allow for an\n\n       assessment of unreasonableness. It stated,\n\n              \u201cExisting high volumes of local truck traffic already pose environmental and safety\n\n              concerns which the Fourth Amended Complaint does not factually or statistically allege\n\n              and is needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable levels by\n\n              comparison. If an unreasonable level can be determined and factually alleged, it is possible\n\n              that current volumes of truck traffic exceed it and would then be subject to injunctive\n\n              relief.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29          In dismissing count III, which challenged the annexation agreement\u2019s validity, the court\n\n       found plaintiffs had not shown a failure to agree on an essential term. It further found plaintiffs\n\n       had not alleged a legal basis, in the annexation agreement or otherwise, for their claim that a traffic\n\n       study was a condition precedent to the agreement\u2019s execution. The court observed that count III\n\n       was \u201cpremature in assuming that *** the parties to the Annexation Agreement will disagree on\n\n       topics not specifically defined in the agreement.\u201d The court did not address defendants\u2019 standing\n\n       argument directly; however, it observed that \u201c[n]o disagreement or dispute between the parties to\n\n       the [annexation agreement] is before the Court.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30          In dismissing count IV, which alleged a deficient hearing notice, the court determined that\n\n       the Open Meetings Act did not \u201crequire that the notice be as detailed and error-free as argued [by]\n\n\n                                                         9\n\f       plaintiffs.\u201d The court also noted that plaintiffs did not allege the legal descriptions or PINs\n\n       prevented anyone from understanding the size, location, or boundaries of the area covered by the\n\n       proposed annexation.\n\n\u00b6 31           Finally, in dismissing count V, which alleged Open Meetings Act violations, the court\n\n       noted the Governor\u2019s face-mask mandate was directed at individuals, not municipalities. It further\n\n       noted that no legal basis exists, in statute or common law, to invalidate an ordinance or annexation\n\n       agreement passed at a public hearing where face masks were not worn.\n\n\u00b6 32           Stop NorthPoint, LLC, the Allen J. Lynch Medal of Honor Veterans Foundation, and 33\n\n       individual plaintiffs appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling. 2\n\n\u00b6 33                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 34           On appeal, plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred in dismissing counts I through V of\n\n       their fourth amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action under section 2-615 of the\n\n       Code (735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2022)). A section 2-615 motion to dismiss challenges a\n\n       complaint\u2019s legal sufficiency based on facial defects. Marshall v. Burger King Corp., 222 Ill. 2d\n\n       422, 429 (2006). Because Illinois is a fact-pleading jurisdiction, a complaint must contain\n\n       sufficient factual allegations to bring its claims within legally recognized causes of action. Id. at\n\n       429-30. The circuit court considers, in ruling on a section 2-615 motion, whether the complaint\u2019s\n\n       factual allegations, when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, are sufficient to state a\n\n       claim on which relief can be granted. Id. at 429. A section 2-615 motion to dismiss admits all well-\n\n       pled facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. Id. A complaint should not be dismissed\n\n       under section 2-615 unless it is clear no set of facts can be proven that will entitle the plaintiff to\n\n\n\n               2\n                The remaining 21 plaintiffs did not participate in this appeal and are not further referred to herein\n       as plaintiffs.\n                                                            10\n\f       relief. Id. We review an order granting a section 2-615 motion de novo, drawing all reasonable\n\n       inferences in favor of the nonmovant. Id. Moreover, we review the circuit court\u2019s judgment, not\n\n       its rationale, and may affirm the judgment on any basis supported by the record. Smith v. The\n\n       Purple Frog, Inc., 2019 IL App (3d) 180132, \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 35                                             A. Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 36          Because plaintiffs bring claims for both private and public nuisance, we begin by\n\n       distinguishing between the two types of nuisances.\n\n\u00b6 37                                         1. Private Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 38          \u201cA private nuisance is the substantial invasion of a person\u2019s interest in the use and\n\n       enjoyment of his property.\u201d Whipple v. Village of North Utica, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 45.\n\n       The invasion must be unreasonable and either intentional or negligent. Id. \u201cWhether particular\n\n       conduct constitutes a \u2018nuisance\u2019 is determined by the conduct\u2019s effect on a reasonable person.\u201d Id.\n\n       \u201cA nuisance must be physically offensive to the senses to the extent that it makes life\n\n       uncomfortable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 39                                          2. Public Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 40          Unlike a private nuisance, which is an unreasonable interference with a property interest,\n\n       a public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the public. City of\n\n       Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 213 Ill. 2d 351, 366 (2004). \u201cSuch rights include the rights of\n\n       public health, public safety, public peace, public comfort, and public convenience.\u201d Id. at 370-71.\n\n       Nuisance may affect both a public and private right simultaneously; therefore, claims for private\n\n       and public nuisance are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\u00b6 41                              B. Count I\u2014Prospective Private Nuisance\n\n\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f\u00b6 42          Because plaintiffs seek to enjoin a proposed development still in the planning phase, they\n\n       necessarily proceed on a prospective nuisance theory. \u201c[A] prospective nuisance is a fit candidate\n\n       for injunctive relief.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 86 Ill. 2d\n\n       1, 25 (1981). \u201c[A] court of equity may enjoin a threatened or anticipated nuisance, where it clearly\n\n       appears that a nuisance will necessarily result from the contemplated act or thing which it is sought\n\n       to enjoin.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 26. Stated differently, an anticipated nuisance\n\n       may be enjoined preemptively if its threatened or potential harm is highly probable. See id. at 26-\n\n       27.\n\n\u00b6 43          Plaintiffs argue they have sufficiently pled a prospective private nuisance claim. We agree,\n\n       in part. Plaintiffs have alleged the proposed development will result in a significant increase in\n\n       semi-truck traffic, which will lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and generate constant noise,\n\n       vibration, and light pollution, rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable. They have\n\n       also alleged the increased truck traffic will substantially increase environmental pollutants, in the\n\n       form of smoke, fumes, and soot. They attached to their complaint a public health study indicating\n\n       that constant exposure to even low levels of air pollution increases the mortality risk for older\n\n       individuals. Because neighboring residents will be disproportionately subjected to the alleged\n\n       pollutants, count I raises a sufficient claim for private nuisance. Our analysis, however, does not\n\n       stop there.\n\n\u00b6 44                                           1. Property Interest\n\n\u00b6 45          Defendants argue that almost no plaintiffs possess a property interest at risk of invasion by\n\n       the proposed development. Defendants presented this argument in the circuit court as (1) a\n\n       sufficiency challenge under section 2-615 and (2) a standing challenge under section 2-619(a)(9).\n\n       Under both sections, defendants argued, in essence, that the lack of an actionable property interest\n\n\n                                                        12\n\f       was evident on the face of the complaint. Section 2-619 provides that a motion to dismiss must be\n\n       supported by affidavit if the alleged defects do not appear on the face of the pleadings. 735 ILCS\n\n       5/2-619 (West 2022). By negative inference, if the grounds do appear on the face of the pleadings,\n\n       the motion need not be supported by affidavit. In fact, even a section 2-615 motion can be a proper\n\n       vehicle for an affirmative defense if that defense is apparent from the face of the complaint. R&B\n\n       Kapital Development, LLC v. North Shore Community Bank & Trust Co., 358 Ill. App. 3d 912,\n\n       921 (2005). Because defendants\u2019 argument does not tread beyond the complaint, it is \u201cpeculiarly\n\n       within the area of confluence between section 2-615 and section 2-619(a)(9).\u201d Illinois Graphics\n\n       Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill. 2d 469, 486 (1994).\n\n\u00b6 46          On appeal, defendants renew only their sufficiency argument. They maintain that, while a\n\n       plaintiff\u2019s property interest \u201cis an aspect of standing that may be raised as an affirmative defense,\n\n       it is also an element of the cause of action for private nuisance.\u201d Although we may consider any\n\n       argument in defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss that supports the circuit court\u2019s ruling, we give\n\n       precedence to the argument before us\u2014namely, that count I is insufficiently pled as to any plaintiff\n\n       who failed to allege an actionable property interest.\n\n\u00b6 47          Private nuisance has been defined as the \u201csubstantial invasion of another\u2019s interest in the\n\n       use and enjoyment of his or her land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In re Chicago Flood Litigation, 176 Ill.\n\n       2d 179, 204 (1997). Although the land-interest requirement is inherent to this definition, we have\n\n       only had the opportunity to address this requirement in the context of a section 2-619 standing\n\n       challenge. In Whipple, for instance, we addressed as a threshold matter the claim that plaintiffs\n\n       lacked standing to challenge the passage of annexation ordinances and the grant of a special use\n\n       permit for mining operations. Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 17. Ultimately, we found the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\f       defendants failed to meet their burden of proving lack of standing where \u201ceach plaintiff allege[d]\n\n       a possessory interest in property adjacent to or nearby the proposed mine site.\u201d Id. \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 48          Having established that each Whipple plaintiff alleged a possessory property interest, we\n\n       did not revisit the issue when discussing the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 prospective nuisance\n\n       allegations. Indeed, there was no need to revisit the issue where the plaintiffs were each alleged to\n\n       \u201cown, reside on, and/or operate farmland that is adjacent to or within \u00bd mile of\u201d the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. \u00b6 3. This case is distinguishable in that regard, as plaintiffs\u2019\n\n       property interests vary widely with respect to the proposed development. We now address the\n\n       property-interest requirement in the context of defendant\u2019s section 2-615 sufficiency challenge.\n\n       To survive a section 2-615 challenge, a prospective private nuisance claim must allege a property\n\n       interest under threat of invasion.\n\n\u00b6 49          Plaintiffs have pled count I in a manner suggesting all plaintiffs are similarly situated in\n\n       relation to the alleged nuisance. This grouping, however, is belied by the complaint itself, which\n\n       alleges that only some plaintiffs have a property interest in the immediate vicinity of the proposed\n\n       development. According to the complaint, some plaintiffs are individuals who simply have\n\n       occasion to visit the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. Others are veterans organizations in\n\n       neighboring counties. One plaintiff is an individual who does not reside or own property in Illinois.\n\n       This in stark contrast to Whipple, in which the complaint alleged that all of the plaintiffs, without\n\n       exception, had a possessory interest in land adjacent to or within one-half mile of the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. Here, the lumping together of individuals and organizations with\n\n       disparate property interests is unhelpful and obfuscates the ultimate private nuisance analysis. It is\n\n       not, however, fatal to the claims of plaintiffs with actionable property interests.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        14\n\f\u00b6 50           Under the fourth amended complaint, many individual plaintiffs reside or own property in\n\n       various localities throughout Will County. 3 Only a few plaintiffs, however, are specifically alleged\n\n       to possess property interests that would neighbor the NorthPoint Development or be directly\n\n       impacted by it in some way. Plaintiff Kathleen Kirby, a Jackson Township resident, is alleged to\n\n       own property that \u201cwill be adjacent to the footprint of the development.\u201d Plaintiff Joseph Kinsella\n\n       is alleged to own a family farm and business in Wilton Township adjacent to Route 52, \u201cwhich\n\n       will certainly be impacted by the overflow truck traffic caused by the proposed industrial park.\u201d\n\n       Four plaintiffs are alleged to own property contiguous or adjacent to the proposed development:\n\n       Coley O\u2019Connell, Sarah O\u2019Connell, Robert Hauert, and Angel Hauert. Viewing the complaint in\n\n       the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we find count I sufficiently pled as to these six plaintiffs.\n\n\u00b6 51           We acknowledge the circuit court found count I deficiently pled due to the lack of\n\n       (1) allegations substantiating the immediacy of the threat of harm and (2) allegations detailing a\n\n       \u201cspecific identifiable and measurable nuisance use.\u201d Because these objections mirror defendants\u2019\n\n       arguments on appeal, we address both.\n\n\u00b6 52                                          2. Immediacy of Threat\n\n\u00b6 53           First, the circuit court emphasized that, for an injunction to issue, a threat of harm must be\n\n       \u201creal and immediate.\u201d Accordingly, it held plaintiffs to a pleading standard requiring \u201cfactual\n\n       allegations showing that the threat is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court derived its\n\n       immediacy requirement from the following language quoted by this court in Whipple:\n\n               \u201c \u2018While, as a general proposition, an injunction will be granted only to restrain an actual,\n\n               existing nuisance, a court of equity may enjoin a threatened or anticipated nuisance, where\n\n\n               In 2020, Will County had a land area of 835.88 square miles. U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts:\n               3\n\n       Will County, Illinois, U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/willcountyillinois/\n       LND110220 (last visited Jan. 16, 2024) [https://perma.cc/WG6T-5UT5].\n                                                           15\n\f              it clearly appears that a nuisance will necessarily result from the contemplated act or thing\n\n              which it is sought to enjoin. This is particularly true where the proof shows that the\n\n              apprehension of material injury is well grounded upon a state of facts from which it appears\n\n              that the danger is real and immediate. While care should be used in granting injunctions to\n\n              avoid prospective injuries, there is no requirement that the court must wait until the injury\n\n              occurs before granting relief.\u2019 \u201d Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 46 (quoting Fink v.\n\n              Board of Trustees of Southern Illinois University, 71 Ill. App. 2d 276, 281-82 (1966)).\n\n       Fink sets forth the following guiding principle: a prospective nuisance may be enjoined where it\n\n       clearly appears a nuisance will necessarily result. Id. It then observes, \u201c \u2018This is particularly true\n\n       where the proof shows that the apprehension of material injury is well grounded upon a state of\n\n       facts from which it appears that the danger is real and immediate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. (quoting\n\n       Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 281-82). The circuit court underscored Fink\u2019s \u201creal and immediate\u201d\n\n       language but overlooked its context. Even so, plaintiffs\u2019 prospective nuisance allegations are well\n\n       grounded upon a highly probable state of facts derived from defendants\u2019 annexation agreement.\n\n       See Kaiser v. Fleming, 315 Ill. App. 3d 921, 925 (2000) (exhibits attached to complaint become\n\n       part of complaint for purpose of motion to dismiss). When viewed alongside plaintiffs\u2019 allegations,\n\n       the agreement substantiates the threat of a real and immediate danger.\n\n\u00b6 54          Indeed, immediacy is sufficiently alleged where an intergovernmental contract has been\n\n       executed, binding defendants for 20 years and providing for the development of a warehousing\n\n       and truck terminal park. The contract carries with it significant obligations on the contracting\n\n       parties and must be presumed enforceable through completion. If the agreement\u2019s objectives are\n\n       realized, there is little doubt the outcome will be an increase in truck traffic and, necessarily, all\n\n       consequences of that increase. \u201cWhile care should be used in granting injunctions to avoid\n\n\n                                                        16\n\f       prospective injuries, there is no requirement that the court must wait until the injury occurs before\n\n       granting relief.\u201d Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 282. Although the NorthPoint Development will take years\n\n       to complete, there is no reason plaintiffs should wait until full build-out to seek an injunction.\n\n\u00b6 55           The circuit court misconstrued Fink\u2019s immediacy language as requiring specific facts at\n\n       the pleading stage indicating a real and immediate danger. Such a requirement is an overextension\n\n       of the court\u2019s statement, made in the context of proof, not pleading, and prefaced by the phrase\n\n       \u201cthis is particularly true,\u201d serving to highlight a circumstance where the guiding principle (see\n\n       supra \u00b6 53) is particularly, though not exclusively, applicable. Our supreme court has, in fact,\n\n       recognized that establishing a serious and imminent threat of harm is only one way to prompt the\n\n       issuance of a permanent injunction. See Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 30 (\u201c \u2018Ordinarily a permanent\n\n       injunction will not lie unless (1) either the polluter seriously and imminently threatens the public\n\n       health or (2) he causes non-health injuries that are substantial and the business cannot be operated\n\n       to avoid the injuries apprehended.\u2019 \u201d (Emphases added.) (quoting Harrison v. Indiana Auto\n\n       Shredders Co., 528 F.2d 1107, 1123 (7th Cir. 1975))). Thus, while evidence of a real and\n\n       immediate danger makes a prospective nuisance an especially apt candidate for injunctive relief,\n\n       it is not essential at the pleading stage.\n\n\u00b6 56           Further, the immediacy language reflects the unique facts in Fink, in which a real and\n\n       immediate danger was shown where the defendant testified it intended to regularly spill large\n\n       quantities of sewage effluent, after chlorination treatment, into an intermittent watercourse flowing\n\n       past the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 279. The intermittent watercourse was already\n\n       present at the time of the injunction hearing, and it was just a matter of spilling the effluent in the\n\n       watercourse for the harm to be done. Id. at 279-280. The nature of the alleged nuisance in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                         17\n\f       present case is different, and perhaps more intrusive, than in Fink. 4 Count I sufficiently alleges\n\n       both the vexing effects of vibrations, noise, and air pollution and the pernicious effects of increases\n\n       in truck-generated smoke, fumes, and soot on plaintiffs with actionable property interests.\n\n\u00b6 57                                      3. Specific Nuisance Allegations\n\n\u00b6 58           The circuit court offered individual plaintiffs a chance to bring private nuisance actions in\n\n       the future, on the condition they could allege a \u201cspecific, identifiable and measurable nuisance\n\n       use\u201d\u2014whether threatened or actual\u2014on \u201ca parcel in the annexed area.\u201d Presumably, the court did\n\n       not believe truck-traffic congestion could yield an actionable nuisance. It stated that while it agrees\n\n       with the allegation that truck traffic is \u201cannoying\u201d due to noise, exhaust emissions, and safety\n\n       concerns, and that it will likely increase over the coming years, plaintiffs failed to allege \u201cspecific\n\n       facts showing a real threat of immediate harm, physical injury or violation of property interest.\u201d\n\n       (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u00b6 59           Once again, the court underscored immediacy. Such a requirement is satisfied by virtue of\n\n       defendants\u2019 fully executed annexation agreement. It makes little sense to foreclose a prospective\n\n       nuisance action simply because the enabling contract will be actualized in phases or over a period\n\n       of years. See Whipple, 2017 IL App (3d) 150547, \u00b6 52 (executed annexation agreement establishes\n\n       basis for not viewing allegations of prospective harm as merely uncertain or speculative).\n\n       Moreover, while we agree that allegations of \u201cspecific, identifiable, measurable nuisance use\u201d\n\n       would be advantageous to plaintiffs\u2019 cause, the complaint furnishes sufficient allegations for a\n\n       court, viewing the complaint in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, to find it sufficiently states a\n\n       claim for private nuisance. Truck traffic that constantly annoys neighboring property owners due\n\n\n\n               4\n                In Fink, the court affirmed the grant of injunctive relief despite recognizing the harm was largely\n       subjective. Fink, 71 Ill. App. 2d at 280.\n                                                           18\n\f       to noise, exhaust emissions, and safety concerns fits squarely within a private nuisance\u2019s general\n\n       definition: a substantial invasion of a person\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of his property.\n\n       Id. \u00b6 45. The court should not attempt, at the pleading stage, to weigh the threatened harm on a\n\n       \u201creasonableness scale.\u201d In resolving a section 2-615 motion to dismiss, the court may not assess\n\n       whether truck-traffic congestion will necessarily result in a substantial and unreasonable\n\n       interference with the neighboring residents\u2019 property interests. Accordingly, count I should have\n\n       been allowed to stand. We reverse the dismissal of count I as to the following plaintiffs: (1) Coley\n\n       O\u2019Connell, (2) Sarah O\u2019Connell, (3) Robert Hauert, (4) Angel Hauert, (5) Kathleen Kirby, and\n\n       (6) Joseph Kinsella.\n\n\u00b6 60                               C. Count II\u2014Prospective Public Nuisance\n\n\u00b6 61          Plaintiffs\u2019 briefs to this court make no reference to public nuisance as defined in the City\u2019s\n\n       municipal code. Accordingly, plaintiffs have forfeited any argument that the circuit court erred in\n\n       dismissing count II for failure to state a claim under the City\u2019s municipal code. See Ill. S. Ct. R.\n\n       341(h)(7) (eff. Oct. 1, 2020) (\u201cPoints not argued are forfeited ***.\u201d). We now consider whether\n\n       plaintiffs sufficiently pled a claim for public nuisance under the common law.\n\n\u00b6 62          \u201cWhen the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability is public nuisance, the pleading requirements are\n\n       not exacting because the \u2018concept of common law public nuisance *** elude[s] precise\n\n       definition.\u2019 \u201d Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 213 Ill. 2d at 364 (quoting City of Chicago v. Festival Theatre\n\n       Corp., 91 Ill. 2d 295, 306 (1982)). \u201cA sufficient pleading in a public nuisance cause of action will\n\n       allege a right common to the general public, the transgression of that right by the defendant, and\n\n       resulting injury.\u201d Id. at 369. Rights common to the general public include \u201cthe rights of public\n\n       health, public safety, public peace, public comfort, and public convenience.\u201d Id. at 370-71.\n\n       Because the alleged injury is prospective, plaintiffs must sufficiently plead that it \u201cwill necessarily\n\n\n                                                         19\n\f       result from the contemplated act or thing which it is sought to enjoin.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\n\n       omitted.) Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 26.\n\n\u00b6 63           Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for common-law public nuisance. With respect\n\n       to public health, plaintiffs alleged that a substantial increase in truck traffic will generate\n\n       significant amounts of noxious exhaust and diesel fumes especially harmful to the older members\n\n       of the community. With respect to public peace and comfort, plaintiffs alleged truck-traffic noise,\n\n       vibration, and pollution will interfere with the dignity, serenity, and quiet of visitors at a nearby\n\n       national cemetery. With respect to public convenience, plaintiffs alleged truck-traffic congestion\n\n       will increase motorists\u2019 travel times in the community. With respect to public safety, plaintiffs\n\n       alleged constant truck traffic will lead to a rise in semi-truck crash incidents.\n\n\u00b6 64           Defendants argue plaintiffs failed to allege that the NorthPoint Development would violate\n\n       any noise or air pollution regulations. While this could be a factor for the circuit court to consider\n\n       at an injunction hearing, it is not a pleading requirement. Defendants also argue that an\n\n       Environmental Defense Fund article referenced in plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief to this court, which\n\n       discusses the burden of truck-generated air pollution exposure, \u201crecognizes that there is a market-\n\n       driven need for warehouses, which bring jobs and economic growth opportunities; that there are\n\n       affordable ways to mitigate pollution, including zero-emissions trucks[;] and that recent moves of\n\n       the government are turbocharging investments in clean non-diesel trucks.\u201d This information, while\n\n       perhaps relevant in an injunction proceeding, does not negate the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 well-pled\n\n       allegations.\n\n\u00b6 65          The circuit court, in dismissing count II, stated that injunctive relief would be \u201cof dubious\n\n       value since truck traffic in the Joliet area *** is likely to increase even if this development were\n\n       enjoined since warehouse and industrial uses continue to grow ***, simply due to the existence of\n\n\n                                                         20\n\f       the intermodal facility now operating at its Will County location.\u201d The court further stated that the\n\n       complaint\u2019s public nuisance allegations were insufficient for failing to allege the \u201cenvironmental\n\n       and safety concerns\u201d of existing levels of local truck traffic. The court opined that such \u201cfactual[ ]\n\n       and statistical[ ]\u201d information \u201cis needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable\n\n       levels by comparison.\u201d 5 We do not agree with the need for specific benchmark statistics at the\n\n       pleading stage. An injunction hearing is required if the court wishes to compare current and\n\n       prospective data to determine whether the proposed development is reasonable. Moreover, the\n\n       court\u2019s prognosis of the requested injunction\u2019s efficacy is improper at this stage\u2014as is its\n\n       consideration of the existing intermodal facility in Will County. \u201c[C]ourts may not rely on matters\n\n       outside the complaint in considering a section 2-615 motion.\u201d Lake Point Tower Condominium\n\n       Ass\u2019n v. Waller, 2017 IL App (1st) 162072, \u00b6 10.\n\n\u00b6 66           We emphasize that section 2-615 warrants dismissal only if it is clear from the pleadings\n\n       that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts entitling them to relief. Id. Construing the complaint in the\n\n       light most favorable to plaintiffs, and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, it is not clear\n\n       that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts entitling them to relief. As pled, count II sufficiently alleges\n\n       rights common to the general public, the likely transgression of those rights by defendants, and\n\n       resulting injuries. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of count II insofar as it adequately states\n\n       a claim for common-law public nuisance.\n\n\u00b6 67                           D. Count III\u2014Validity of Annexation Agreement\n\n\u00b6 68           Plaintiffs argue they have sufficiently pled count III, in which they seek to void defendants\u2019\n\n       annexation agreement for vagueness. Count III rests on the theory that the annexation agreement\n\n\n\n\n               The circuit court also highlighted what it believed was the lack of an immediate threat, which we\n               5\n\n       have already addressed. Supra \u00b6\u00b6 53-59.\n                                                          21\n\f       is so indefinite and vague that a contract was never formed. It alleges, primarily, that numerous\n\n       essential terms are expressly contingent on a traffic study, the absence of which renders the\n\n       material terms of the agreement vague and the parties\u2019 contractual obligations undeterminable.\n\n\u00b6 69           Defendants argue, as they did in the section 2-619 portion of their combined motion to\n\n       dismiss, that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the annexation agreement\u2019s enforceability. A\n\n       section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss is proper where \u201cthe claim asserted against defendant is\n\n       barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.\u201d 735 ILCS\n\n       5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2022). \u201cLack of standing is an \u2018affirmative matter\u2019 properly challenged in a\n\n       section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss.\u201d McCready v. Secretary of State, 382 Ill. App. 3d 789, 794-\n\n       95 (2008). Much like section 2-615, section 2-619 requires the circuit court to take all well-pled\n\n       facts in the complaint as true. Id. at 795. The court\u2019s dismissal under either section is subject to\n\n       de novo review. Id.\n\n\u00b6 70           \u201c[O]nly a party to the contract, one in privity with a party to the contract, or a third-party\n\n       beneficiary of the contract has standing to sue on a contract.\u201d Haake v. Board of Education for\n\n       Glenbard Township High School District 87, 399 Ill. App. 3d 121, 128-29 (2010). Nonparties to a\n\n       contract, including a municipal contract, who wish to sue based on the contract must plead their\n\n       status as third-party intended beneficiaries. See Salvi v. Village of Lake Zurich, 2016 IL App (2d)\n\n       150249, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55. Plaintiffs have not alleged third-party beneficiary status. Instead, they argue\n\n       count III is properly brought as a taxpayer action by six individual plaintiffs who pay taxes to the\n\n       City.\n\n\u00b6 71           A taxpayer action is brought \u201cfor the purpose of seeking relief from illegal or unauthorized\n\n       acts of public bodies or public officials, which acts are injurious to their common interests as such\n\n       taxpayers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Scachitti v. UBS Financial Services, 215 Ill. 2d\n\n\n                                                        22\n\f       484, 493 (2005). While the thrust of the complaint is arguably to prevent \u201cacts injurious to\n\n       [plaintiffs\u2019] common interests,\u201d count III seeks to invalidate a contract based on vague and\n\n       indefinite provisions. Unsatisfactory contract drafting does not qualify as an illegal or unauthorized\n\n       act of a public body or public official. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal, although we\n\n       do so under section 2-619 of the Code. See 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (West 2022); see also People v.\n\n       Gawlak, 2019 IL 123182, \u00b6 39 (reviewing court may affirm on any basis in the record).\n\n\u00b6 72                              E. Count IV\u2014Hearing Notice Deficiencies\n\n\u00b6 73          Count IV also seeks to invalidate the annexation agreement. Unlike count III, however,\n\n       count IV does not attack the contract\u2019s substance. Instead, it attacks the notice issued for the public\n\n       hearing at which the agreement was approved. Plaintiffs alleged the City issued an inaccurate and\n\n       confusing notice which failed to comport with due process under the Illinois Constitution.\n\n       Specifically, plaintiffs alleged the notice contained incomplete, missing, and mismatched PINs.\n\n       Plaintiffs did not, however, allege any prejudice resulting from the alleged defects. Failure to allege\n\n       prejudice from a defective notice is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 claim. See Rogers v. City of Jerseyville, 196\n\n       Ill. App. 3d 136, 140 (1990) (\u201cDefects in notice of hearing on an application for zoning variances\n\n       may not be raised by parties who had actual notice of the meeting, failed to object to the alleged\n\n       defect at the meeting, and showed no prejudice from such defect.\u201d). The court properly dismissed\n\n       count IV.\n\n\u00b6 74                              F. Count V\u2014Open Meetings Act Violation\n\n\u00b6 75          Finally, count V seeks to nullify the annexation agreement because the November and\n\n       December 2021 plan commission hearings were conducted without a face-mask requirement.\n\n       Plaintiffs alleged that, in September 2021, \u201cGovernor JB Pritzker signed Executive Order 21-22,\n\n       requiring all individuals over the age of 2 and who can medically tolerate a face covering to wear\n\n\n                                                         23\n\f       a face covering when in indoor public places.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See Exec. Order No. 2021-\n\n       22, 45 Ill. Reg. 11,639 (Sept. 3, 2021), https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/\n\n       illinois/documents/government/executive-order-2021-22.pdf            [https://perma.cc/6ZVT-ES2M].\n\n       Plaintiffs alleged the City did not require masks at either hearing despite holding both during the\n\n       outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in an indoor public place subject to the governor\u2019s\n\n       mask mandate. As a result, members of the public who wished to participate in the hearings were\n\n       forced to risk their health and the health of their families and friends. This, according to plaintiffs,\n\n       amounted to a violation of section 2.01 of the Open Meetings Act (Act), which requires meetings\n\n       be held at \u201cspecified times and places which are convenient and open to the public.\u201d (Emphasis\n\n       added.) 5 ILCS 120/2.01 (West 2020). Plaintiffs argue that an open meeting held in an\n\n       inconvenient place violates the Act.\n\n\u00b6 76          \u201cA meeting can be open in the sense that no one is prohibited from attending it, but it can\n\n       be held in such an ill-suited, unaccommodating, unadvantageous place that members of the public,\n\n       as a practical matter, would be deterred from attending it.\u201d Gerwin v. Livingston County Board,\n\n       345 Ill. App. 3d 352, 361 (2003).\u201cSection 2.01 requires a place that is \u2018convenient\u2019 not merely to\n\n       members of the public who show up for the meeting but to the \u2018public\u2019 as a whole.\u201d Id. at 362.\n\n       \u201cThe concept of public convenience seems to imply a rule of reasonableness, not absolute\n\n       accessibility but reasonable accessibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 77          In essence, count V alleges the City\u2019s decision not to mandate masks amounted to a\n\n       violation of the Act\u2019s convenient-meetings requirement. Although the City\u2019s failure to mandate\n\n       masks is arguably contrary to the spirit of the Act, as it could deter public participation, it is not\n\n       contrary to the Act\u2019s plain language. \u201cThe best indicator of legislative intent is the statutory\n\n       language itself, given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d Cothron v. White Castle Systems, Inc., 2023\n\n\n                                                         24\n\f       IL 128004, \u00b6 20. \u201cWhere the language is clear and unambiguous, we must apply the statute without\n\n       resort to further aids of statutory construction.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 78          Section 2.01 requires municipalities to hold public hearings at convenient places and times.\n\n       5 ILCS 120/2.01 (West 2020). The section does not require municipalities to adjust their hearing\n\n       protocols based on public health advisories or external health directives. Moreover, by plaintiffs\u2019\n\n       own admission, the health directives in this case targeted individuals, not municipal governments.\n\n       See supra \u00b6 75. Thus, given that (1) the executive order did not task municipal governments with\n\n       mask-mandate enforcement and (2) the legislature placed a convenience requirement exclusively\n\n       on meeting places and times, the complaint cannot state a claim under section 2.01 of the Act. In\n\n       so ruling, we recognize the hearings\u2019 mask-optional rule might have deterred public participation;\n\n       however, the judiciary may not act as a policymaker in construing the Act\u2019s provisions. See\n\n       Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Rosen, 242 Ill. 2d 48, 56 (2011) (\u201c[W]hen the legislature has declared,\n\n       by law, the public policy of the State, the judicial department must remain silent, and if a\n\n       modification or change in such policy is desired the law-making department must be applied to,\n\n       and not the judiciary, whose function is to declare the law but not to make it.\u201d (Internal quotation\n\n       marks omitted.)).\n\n\u00b6 79          Count V does not allege the City failed to provide a convenient time for its hearings. Nor\n\n       does it allege the City held the hearings in an \u201cill-suited, unaccommodating, [or] unadvantageous\u201d\n\n       place. Gerwin, 345 Ill. App. 3d at 361. Accordingly, when construed in the light most favorable to\n\n       plaintiffs, count V failed to state a cause of action under the Act. The court properly dismissed\n\n       count V.\n\n\u00b6 80                                           III.

The circuit court\n\n     dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action.\n\n     See 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2020). For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in\n\n     part.\n\n\u00b62                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63                                         A. Original Complaint\n\n\u00b64           In October 2020, Stop NorthPoint, LLC, along with 17 individuals, filed suit to prevent the\n\n     City from annexing, and East Gate from developing, 1262 acres of unincorporated land in Will\n\n     County between the villages of Elwood and Manhattan. Plaintiffs alleged that East Gate\u2019s\n\n                                                      2\n\f     proposed development, an industrial business park (NorthPoint Development) complete with\n\n     warehouses and truck terminals, would constitute a public and private nuisance and that\n\n     defendant\u2019s preannexation agreement providing for the development was null and void. Thereafter,\n\n     plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming 18 additional plaintiffs. They also moved for a\n\n     temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the City from holding two\n\n     hearings scheduled for December 2020 regarding the preannexation agreement. The circuit court\n\n     denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\n\n\u00b65          Defendants executed an annexation and development agreement (annexation agreement)\n\n     following the second December 2020 hearing. The annexation agreement provided that East Gate\n\n     intends to develop a multi-phased light industrial business park on primarily vacant land within\n\n     three miles of two major intermodal facilities. The agreement acknowledged the presence of \u201clittle\n\n     residential property in close proximity to the Property\u201d and stated that the NorthPoint Development\n\n     \u201cis specifically designed to minimize its impact on the surrounding community, and to decrease\n\n     the current amount of truck traffic on Illinois Route 53 and other local roads outside of the park by\n\n     a variety of features described herein, including bridges and a closed loop truck network.\u201d In\n\n     addition to its annexation and zoning provisions, the agreement provided for, inter alia, road\n\n     improvements, a closed loop truck network, sewer and water systems, residential buffers,\n\n     subdivision applications, and community enhancement contributions. It included a \u201ctime is of the\n\n     essence\u201d clause and provided for a 20-year term.\n\n\u00b66                                    B. Second Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b67          In March 2021, plaintiffs filed a 10-count second amended complaint naming 20 additional\n\n     plaintiffs, for a total of 56. Aside from Stop NorthPoint, LLC, which was formed to oppose the\n\n     NorthPoint Development, plaintiffs are primarily military veterans organizations and individuals\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f     (many veterans themselves) who own property or reside in Will County. Some have family or\n\n     friends interred in the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, a national shrine located southwest of\n\n     the proposed development. Some own property near or contiguous to the proposed development.\n\n     The second amended complaint alleges, most notably, that the proposed development will\n\n     constitute a nuisance, the annexation agreement is void, and the City conducted the December\n\n     2020 hearings without proper notice and in violation of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1\n\n     et seq. (West 2020)).\n\n\u00b68          In April 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to\n\n     section 2-619.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2-619.1 (West 2020)). After\n\n     briefing and an oral argument, the circuit court issued a written order in July 2021 granting\n\n     defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, though without prejudice as to any\n\n     specific, identifiable private nuisance claim an individual plaintiff may acquire in the future.\n\n\u00b69          In August 2021, plaintiffs moved to reconsider and, in the alternative, for leave to file a\n\n     third amended complaint. After their motion was fully briefed, plaintiffs learned the City\u2019s plan\n\n     commission intended to hold a public hearing in November 2021 to address an amended\n\n     annexation agreement which plaintiffs believed could moot part of the second amended complaint\n\n     and give rise to new causes of action. Plaintiffs asked the court to stay its ruling on the motion to\n\n     reconsider until after the plan commission\u2019s meeting. The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request and\n\n     ultimately granted plaintiff leave to file a third amended complaint. In December 2021, defendants\n\n     executed the amended annexation agreement following a public hearing. 1 Plaintiffs filed a third\n\n     amended complaint in February 2022.\n\n\n\n\n            1\n              The amended agreement largely retained the provisions of the original annexation agreement as\n     stated in paragraph five of this opinion.\n                                                       4\n\f\u00b6 10                                     C. Third Amended Complaint\n\n\u00b6 11                                       1. Allegations and Exhibits\n\n\u00b6 12           Plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint contains the five counts at issue in this appeal. Counts\n\n       I and II form the gravamen of the third amended complaint. Under those counts, plaintiffs allege\n\n       that, if allowed to proceed, the NorthPoint Development would constitute a private nuisance (count\n\n       I) and a public nuisance (count II). The complaint cites a 2020 traffic impact study commissioned\n\n       by the Village of Manhattan indicating that \u201cat full build-out, the Development will generate an\n\n       additional 10,370 trucks per day.\u201d This figure, plaintiffs allege, is a conservative estimate.\n\n\u00b6 13           In support of their private and public nuisance claims, plaintiffs allege that constant truck\n\n       traffic will (1) cause noise, vibration, pollution, and harm to the environment; (2) interfere with\n\n       the dignity, serenity, and quiet of the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery; (3) endanger\n\n       pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers; (4) generate noxious exhaust and diesel fumes harmful to\n\n       public health and to wildlife, wetlands, and streams; (5) deteriorate streets and necessarily increase\n\n       property taxes to cover repairs; (6) lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and cause constant noise and\n\n       vibrations rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable; (7) produce vibrations likely to\n\n       cause damage to nearby homes, property, and structures; (8) increase plaintiffs\u2019 travel times; and\n\n       (9) lead to a rise in semi-truck crash incidents and collisions with wildlife. Count II additionally\n\n       alleges the proposed development will constitute a public nuisance under the City\u2019s municipal\n\n       code.\n\n\u00b6 14           Count III, brought as a purported taxpayer claim, alleges the new annexation agreement is\n\n       null and void, and unenforceable for vagueness and indefiniteness.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f\u00b6 15          Count IV alleges the November 2021 plan commission hearing was constitutionally\n\n       deficient due to a notice fraught with deficiencies and inaccuracies relating to parcel index numbers\n\n       (PINs), legal descriptions, and acreage.\n\n\u00b6 16          Count V alleges violations of the Open Meetings Act based on the City\u2019s failure to require\n\n       face masks at the November and December 2021 plan commission hearings despite a state-wide\n\n       individual mask mandate and despite the risk that attendees would contract the Omicron variant of\n\n       COVID-19.\n\n\u00b6 17          All counts include a request for (1) a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining\n\n       defendants from developing the proposed industrial business park, (2) a declaratory judgment that\n\n       the annexation agreement is void and the annexation is unlawful, and (3) attorney fees and costs.\n\n\u00b6 18          Plaintiffs attached the following exhibits to their complaint: (1) defendants\u2019 amended\n\n       annexation agreement, (2) a letter to the Village of Elwood from the Department of Veterans\n\n       Affairs-National Cemetery Administration, expressing            concerns about the NorthPoint\n\n       Development, (3) traffic crash reports involving truck drivers causing property damage to the\n\n       Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, (4) a research study finding that older Americans who\n\n       regularly breathe even low levels of air pollution face an increased mortality risk, (5) a resolution\n\n       passed by the City of Edgerton, Kansas, to issue $500 million in industrial revenue bonds to fund\n\n       the second development phase of a logistics park similar to the NorthPoint Development, (6) a\n\n       public health study predicting 1900 premature deaths and $17 billion in social costs nationwide\n\n       due to emissions attributable to traffic congestion, and (7) the public hearing notice for the City\u2019s\n\n       November 2021 plan commission hearing.\n\n\u00b6 19                                          2. Motion to Dismiss\n\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f\u00b6 20          In March 2022, defendants filed a combined motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2-619.1\n\n       of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2-619.1 (West 2022)). Under section 2-615, they argued that all five\n\n       counts failed to allege sufficient facts to support any cause of action. Under section 2-619,\n\n       defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 standing under counts I (private nuisance) and III (annexation\n\n       agreement validity). As to count I, defendants argued that, except for a few plaintiffs who allegedly\n\n       own property contiguous to the proposed development, none of the plaintiffs have standing to\n\n       bring a claim for private nuisance. As to count III, defendants argued plaintiffs had no standing to\n\n       challenge the annexation agreement\u2019s enforceability and, moreover, contract enforceability does\n\n       not provide a basis for a taxpayer suit.\n\n\u00b6 21          In response, plaintiffs argued defendants\u2019 section 2-615 argument attempted to hold\n\n       plaintiffs to an \u201cimpossible pleading standard.\u201d Plaintiffs maintained they had standing to raise\n\n       their claims and emphasized defendants were \u201ctrying to push through this gargantuan trucking and\n\n       warehouse development without even a traffic or environmental study.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 22                              3. Environmental Consultation Requirement\n\n\u00b6 23          After briefing and oral argument, the court took the matter under advisement and directed\n\n       the parties to submit any law with respect to the necessity of an environmental impact study. Upon\n\n       receiving the parties\u2019 submissions, the court found that \u201cissues should be considered with regards\n\n       to the provisions of the Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30/17) and *** McHenry\n\n       County Defenders v. City of Harvard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2214152\"><a href=\"/opinion/2214152/mchenry-county-defenders-inc-v-city-of-harvard/\">384 Ill. App. 3d 265</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\u201d In July 2022, the court allowed\n\n       plaintiffs to file a fourth amended complaint restating the third amended complaint \u201cin full as it\n\n       exists now\u201d and adding any counts to address issues concerning the Illinois Natural Areas\n\n       Preservation Act (525 ILCS 30/1 et seq. (West 2022)). The court further stated that the parties\u2019\n\n       arguments concerning defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cshall stand as a fully briefed and argued\n\n\n                                                        7\n\f       Motion to Dismiss those counts that are restated in the Fourth Amended Complaint, with ruling as\n\n       to those counts to remain pending.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24           Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint maintaining the existing five counts\n\n       and adding a sixth count, which sought a writ of mandamus directing the City to engage in\n\n       environmental consultations with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. On defendants\u2019\n\n       motion, the court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s mandamus claim (count VI) for mootness, finding the City\n\n       had completed the environmental consultation process demanded by plaintiffs. Count VI is not at\n\n       issue in this appeal.\n\n\u00b6 25                                       D. Circuit Court Decision\n\n\u00b6 26           In September 2022, the circuit court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I through\n\n       V of the fourth amended complaint, which had \u201crestated verbatim the 5 Counts of the Third\n\n       Amended Complaint and added Count VI seeking Mandamus.\u201d The court entered a written ruling\n\n       in which it found count I (private nuisance) improperly \u201clumps Plaintiffs that have distinct rights\n\n       and interests into a single group.\u201d Observing the nonuniform impact of noise and exhaust\n\n       emissions on plaintiffs and that \u201csafety will vary greatly based on proximity,\u201d the court dismissed\n\n       count I \u201cwithout prejudice as to any future individual nuisance claim any Plaintiff may acquire\n\n       when a parcel in the annexed area threatens or creates a specific identifiable and measurable\n\n       nuisance use on the parcel.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 27           The court found the nuisance allegations failed to state a cause of action for prospective\n\n       nuisance, whether private or public. In particular, the court found that while plaintiffs alleged the\n\n       proposed development would substantially increase truck traffic, \u201ca proposed or contemplated\n\n       time for completing build-out is not alleged and frankly is not known.\u201d It further stated, \u201cThe\n\n       complaint is describing conditions at an undetermined point in the future which by the nature of\n\n\n                                                        8\n\f       the development remains several years away.\u201d The court found, accordingly, that \u201c[t]he threat of\n\n       future high volume truck traffic is not supported by any factual allegations showing that the threat\n\n       is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u00b6 28          Further, in dismissing count II (public nuisance), the court opined that, due to the operation\n\n       of a nearby intermodal facility, truck traffic was likely to increase even if the proposed\n\n       development was enjoined. The court emphasized the need for benchmark data to allow for an\n\n       assessment of unreasonableness. It stated,\n\n              \u201cExisting high volumes of local truck traffic already pose environmental and safety\n\n              concerns which the Fourth Amended Complaint does not factually or statistically allege\n\n              and is needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable levels by\n\n              comparison. If an unreasonable level can be determined and factually alleged, it is possible\n\n              that current volumes of truck traffic exceed it and would then be subject to injunctive\n\n              relief.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29          In dismissing count III, which challenged the annexation agreement\u2019s validity, the court\n\n       found plaintiffs had not shown a failure to agree on an essential term.

We agree,\n\n       in part. Plaintiffs have alleged the proposed development will result in a significant increase in\n\n       semi-truck traffic, which will lower plaintiffs\u2019 property values and generate constant noise,\n\n       vibration, and light pollution, rendering plaintiffs\u2019 homes unhealthy and untenantable. They have\n\n       also alleged the increased truck traffic will substantially increase environmental pollutants, in the\n\n       form of smoke, fumes, and soot. They attached to their complaint a public health study indicating\n\n       that constant exposure to even low levels of air pollution increases the mortality risk for older\n\n       individuals. Because neighboring residents will be disproportionately subjected to the alleged\n\n       pollutants, count I raises a sufficient claim for private nuisance. Our analysis, however, does not\n\n       stop there.\n\n\u00b6 44                                           1. Property Interest\n\n\u00b6 45          Defendants argue that almost no plaintiffs possess a property interest at risk of invasion by\n\n       the proposed development. Defendants presented this argument in the circuit court as (1) a\n\n       sufficiency challenge under section 2-615 and (2) a standing challenge under section 2-619(a)(9).\n\n       Under both sections, defendants argued, in essence, that the lack of an actionable property interest\n\n\n                                                        12\n\f       was evident on the face of the complaint. Section 2-619 provides that a motion to dismiss must be\n\n       supported by affidavit if the alleged defects do not appear on the face of the pleadings. 735 ILCS\n\n       5/2-619 (West 2022). By negative inference, if the grounds do appear on the face of the pleadings,\n\n       the motion need not be supported by affidavit. In fact, even a section 2-615 motion can be a proper\n\n       vehicle for an affirmative defense if that defense is apparent from the face of the complaint.

They maintain that, while a\n\n       plaintiff\u2019s property interest \u201cis an aspect of standing that may be raised as an affirmative defense,\n\n       it is also an element of the cause of action for private nuisance.\u201d Although we may consider any\n\n       argument in defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss that supports the circuit court\u2019s ruling, we give\n\n       precedence to the argument before us\u2014namely, that count I is insufficiently pled as to any plaintiff\n\n       who failed to allege an actionable property interest.\n\n\u00b6 47          Private nuisance has been defined as the \u201csubstantial invasion of another\u2019s interest in the\n\n       use and enjoyment of his or her land.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Although the land-interest requirement is inherent to this definition, we have\n\n       only had the opportunity to address this requirement in the context of a section 2-619 standing\n\n       challenge.

Ultimately, we found the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\f       defendants failed to meet their burden of proving lack of standing where \u201ceach plaintiff allege[d]\n\n       a possessory interest in property adjacent to or nearby the proposed mine site.\u201d Id. \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 48          Having established that each Whipple plaintiff alleged a possessory property interest, we\n\n       did not revisit the issue when discussing the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 prospective nuisance\n\n       allegations. Indeed, there was no need to revisit the issue where the plaintiffs were each alleged to\n\n       \u201cown, reside on, and/or operate farmland that is adjacent to or within \u00bd mile of\u201d the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. \u00b6 3. This case is distinguishable in that regard, as plaintiffs\u2019\n\n       property interests vary widely with respect to the proposed development. We now address the\n\n       property-interest requirement in the context of defendant\u2019s section 2-615 sufficiency challenge.\n\n       To survive a section 2-615 challenge, a prospective private nuisance claim must allege a property\n\n       interest under threat of invasion.\n\n\u00b6 49          Plaintiffs have pled count I in a manner suggesting all plaintiffs are similarly situated in\n\n       relation to the alleged nuisance. This grouping, however, is belied by the complaint itself, which\n\n       alleges that only some plaintiffs have a property interest in the immediate vicinity of the proposed\n\n       development. According to the complaint, some plaintiffs are individuals who simply have\n\n       occasion to visit the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. Others are veterans organizations in\n\n       neighboring counties. One plaintiff is an individual who does not reside or own property in Illinois.\n\n       This in stark contrast to Whipple, in which the complaint alleged that all of the plaintiffs, without\n\n       exception, had a possessory interest in land adjacent to or within one-half mile of the site of the\n\n       alleged prospective nuisance. Id. Here, the lumping together of individuals and organizations with\n\n       disparate property interests is unhelpful and obfuscates the ultimate private nuisance analysis. It is\n\n       not, however, fatal to the claims of plaintiffs with actionable property interests.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        14\n\f\u00b6 50           Under the fourth amended complaint, many individual plaintiffs reside or own property in\n\n       various localities throughout Will County. 3 Only a few plaintiffs, however, are specifically alleged\n\n       to possess property interests that would neighbor the NorthPoint Development or be directly\n\n       impacted by it in some way. Plaintiff Kathleen Kirby, a Jackson Township resident, is alleged to\n\n       own property that \u201cwill be adjacent to the footprint of the development.\u201d Plaintiff Joseph Kinsella\n\n       is alleged to own a family farm and business in Wilton Township adjacent to Route 52, \u201cwhich\n\n       will certainly be impacted by the overflow truck traffic caused by the proposed industrial park.\u201d\n\n       Four plaintiffs are alleged to own property contiguous or adjacent to the proposed development:\n\n       Coley O\u2019Connell, Sarah O\u2019Connell, Robert Hauert, and Angel Hauert. Viewing the complaint in\n\n       the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we find count I sufficiently pled as to these six plaintiffs.\n\n\u00b6 51           We acknowledge the circuit court found count I deficiently pled due to the lack of\n\n       (1) allegations substantiating the immediacy of the threat of harm and (2) allegations detailing a\n\n       \u201cspecific identifiable and measurable nuisance use.\u201d Because these objections mirror defendants\u2019\n\n       arguments on appeal, we address both.\n\n\u00b6 52                                          2. Immediacy of Threat\n\n\u00b6 53           First, the circuit court emphasized that, for an injunction to issue, a threat of harm must be\n\n       \u201creal and immediate.\u201d Accordingly, it held plaintiffs to a pleading standard requiring \u201cfactual\n\n       allegations showing that the threat is immediate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court derived its\n\n       immediacy requirement from the following language quoted by this court in Whipple:\n\n               \u201c \u2018While, as a general proposition, an injunction will be granted only to restrain an actual,\n\n               existing nuisance, a court of equity may enjoin a threatened or anticipated nuisance, where\n\n\n               In 2020, Will County had a land area of 835.88 square miles.

With respect to public convenience, plaintiffs alleged truck-traffic congestion\n\n       will increase motorists\u2019 travel times in the community.

Defendants also argue that an\n\n       Environmental Defense Fund article referenced in plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief to this court, which\n\n       discusses the burden of truck-generated air pollution exposure, \u201crecognizes that there is a market-\n\n       driven need for warehouses, which bring jobs and economic growth opportunities; that there are\n\n       affordable ways to mitigate pollution, including zero-emissions trucks[;] and that recent moves of\n\n       the government are turbocharging investments in clean non-diesel trucks.\u201d This information, while\n\n       perhaps relevant in an injunction proceeding, does not negate the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 well-pled\n\n       allegations.\n\n\u00b6 65          The circuit court, in dismissing count II, stated that injunctive relief would be \u201cof dubious\n\n       value since truck traffic in the Joliet area *** is likely to increase even if this development were\n\n       enjoined since warehouse and industrial uses continue to grow ***, simply due to the existence of\n\n\n                                                         20\n\f       the intermodal facility now operating at its Will County location.\u201d The court further stated that the\n\n       complaint\u2019s public nuisance allegations were insufficient for failing to allege the \u201cenvironmental\n\n       and safety concerns\u201d of existing levels of local truck traffic. The court opined that such \u201cfactual[ ]\n\n       and statistical[ ]\u201d information \u201cis needed to determine whether future increases pose unreasonable\n\n       levels by comparison.\u201d 5 We do not agree with the need for specific benchmark statistics at the\n\n       pleading stage.

Plaintiffs argue that an open meeting held in an\n\n       inconvenient place violates the Act.\n\n\u00b6 76          \u201cA meeting can be open in the sense that no one is prohibited from attending it, but it can\n\n       be held in such an ill-suited, unaccommodating, unadvantageous place that members of the public,\n\n       as a practical matter, would be deterred from attending it.\u201d Gerwin v.

No. CGC22597932)\n           Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         This appeal arises from successive lawsuits relating to administration\nof the San Francisco Teacher Residency Program (Residency program).\nLoran Simon, a former employee of the Residency program, filed two prior\nlawsuits based on allegations that appellant University of San Francisco\n(USF) and respondent Community Initiatives fraudulently obtained federal\nfunding to administer the Residency program. In the present action, USF\nseeks indemnity from Community Initiatives for damages it incurred in\nconnection with the Simon litigation. This appeal is from an order\ndisqualifying Michael Vartain and Vartain Law Group (Vartain) from\nrepresenting USF in the pending indemnity action due to Vartain\u2019s prior\nrepresentation of Community Initiatives in the Simon lawsuits. We affirm\nthat order.\n\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                              BACKGROUND\nThe Prior Lawsuits\n      Simon\u2019s Complaints\n      In November 2016, Simon filed a federal action against USF and\nCommunity Initiatives under qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. At\nthe time, Simon was Assistant Director of the Residency program, which he\ndescribed as a training program for teachers to improve achievement of\nhistorically underserved students that was operated by five organizations:\nUSF; Community Initiatives; the San Francisco Unified School District (SF\nUnified); the Stanford University Teacher Education Program (Stanford); and\nUnited Educators of San Francisco. According to his complaint, Simon was\ninitially employed by USF in June 2014, and in September 2016 his\nemployment was transferred to Community Initiatives, a fiscal sponsor that\nassisted with administration of the Residency program.\n      Simon alleged that during his tenure as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program, USF and Community Initiatives submitted fraudulent\nclaims to obtain grant money from federal programs, including AmeriCorps\n(previously known as the Corporation for National and Community Services).\nAccording to the complaint, all teacher candidates who participated in the\nResidency program obtained an AmeriCorps stipend, as well as other\nfinancial benefits from their respective universities. Simon alleged that the\ndefendants failed to \u201ctrack\u201d the time and effort of these AmeriCorps\nparticipants and instead used falsified timesheets to obtain federal funding.\n      In June 2019, while his federal case was pending, Simon filed a state\ncourt action seeking damages for wrongful termination, naming multiple\ndefendants including USF, Community Initiatives, and Peter Williamson, a\nStanford faculty member who served as Chairman of the Residency\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\fprogram\u2019s Advisory Board. Simon alleged that on June 30, 2017, he was\nwrongfully terminated from his employment as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program in retaliation for engaging in protected activity, including\ncontesting racial discrimination, and reporting violations of the state and\nfederal False Claims Acts. Simon alleged that the defendants were all liable\nfor his wrongful termination as they were his joint employers and acted\ntogether to terminate him.\n      Arbitration Petitions In Simon\u2019s Wrongful Termination Case\n      On October 2, 2019, USF petitioned the superior court to compel\narbitration and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination action. Vartain drafted\nand filed the petition on behalf of USF. USF sought to compel arbitration\npursuant to a provision in its written employment agreement with Simon.\n      The following day, USF executed a Joint Defense and Confidentiality\nAgreement (JDA) with Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson. The\nstated purpose of the JDA was to \u201censure that exchanges and disclosures of\nconfidential, privileged, and otherwise protected information\u201d among the\nparties for purposes of pursuing a petition for an order to arbitrate were not\ninterpreted as a waiver of the confidential or privileged nature of the\ninformation that was disclosed. Michael Vartain signed the JDA on behalf of\nVartain as attorneys for USF, and Stanford\u2019s Vice President and General\nCounsel, Debra Zumwalt, signed the JDA as attorney for Williamson and\nCommunity Initiatives.\n      The terms of the JDA were set forth in 24 numbered paragraphs,\naddressing issues such as the type of material covered by the agreement, and\nongoing obligations of the parties and their counsel to protect the privileged\nnature of the shared material. Paragraph 11 addressed the subject of\ncontinued representation should a party to the JDA assert a claim against\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fanother party in the wrongful termination case or separate litigation. In that\nevent, the JDA states, \u201ceach attorney of any Party who has access to or\nreceives any Joint Defense Material shared under [the JDA] shall remain\nnonetheless qualified to continue to represent his or her client in the defense\nor pursuit of the claim(s).\u201d In paragraph 11, the parties also agreed to the\nfollowing: \u201cAny conflict of interest arising out of the sharing of Joint Defense\nMaterials under this Agreement is waived. Any right of any Party to move to\ndisqualify any attorney for any Party to this Agreement on the grounds that\nsuch attorney has received Joint Defense Materials shared under this\nAgreement is waived.\u201d\n      On October 4, 2019, Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson filed\na petition for an order to arbitrate and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination\ncomplaint (the non-signatories\u2019 petition). The non-signatories\u2019 petition and\nsupporting documents were signed by Vartain as attorneys for Community\nInitiatives and Williamson. Michael Vartain filed a supporting declaration,\nwhich stated that he was appearing on behalf of Community Initiatives and\nWilliamson for the limited purpose of filing and arguing their arbitration\npetition. In a supporting memorandum, Vartain argued that USF\u2019s\narbitration agreement encompassed Simon\u2019s entire complaint, that Simon\nwas estopped from refusing to arbitrate his claims against Community\nInitiatives and other entity defendants, and that the arbitration agreement\napplied to Williamson and other individual defendants pursuant to principles\nof agency.\n      On November 1, 2019, the superior court held a hearing on both\narbitration petitions. USF\u2019s petition was granted pursuant to an uncontested\ntentative ruling that Simon\u2019s broad arbitration agreement with USF applied\nto his employment law claims. Simon contested a tentative ruling to grant\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fthe non-signatories\u2019 petition, but after the matter was argued, the court\ngranted that petition as well.\n      Dismissals of Simon\u2019s Lawsuits\n      The Simon lawsuits were both resolved in May 2020. On May 18, the\nUnited States government intervened in the qui tam action \u201cfor settlement\npurposes against defendant [USF].\u201d During negotiations between the\ngovernment and USF, Vartain requested that a contemplated release of\nSimon\u2019s qui tam claims also include Community Initiatives, and the\ngovernment agreed to the request. On May 18, the United States and Simon\nfiled a joint proposed dismissal of the qui tam action with prejudice. The\norder was filed May 21, confirming Simon\u2019s dismissal extended to all\ndefendants. The United States dismissed Simon\u2019s claims with prejudice to\nthe extent they were \u201cbrought against USF under the False Claims Act,\narising from USF\u2019s status as the fiscal agent which applied AmeriCorps funds\nto support and administer the [Residency program] during the 2014, 2015,\nand 2016 grant years.\u201d The following week, on May 27, Simon dismissed his\nwrongful termination case, serving notice of the dismissal on Vartain as\nattorneys for USF, Community Initiatives, and Williamson.\nThe Current Indemnity Action\n      In February 2022, USF, represented by Vartain, filed the underlying\naction for contractual and equitable indemnity and declaratory relief, seeking\nto recover more than $4.5 million as damages it incurred to settle the qui tam\naction. USF alleges that its liability in the Simon cases was based solely on\nconduct by the Residency program\u2019s manager, who was the employee and\nagent of SF Unified. In its original complaint, USF named SF Unified as the\nsole defendant, but its operative first amended complaint names Community\nInitiatives and Stanford as additional defendants. USF\u2019s pleaded theory is\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fthat each defendant must indemnify USF in proportion to its relative fault\nrelating to the fraudulent procurement of AmeriCorps funds because they\nwere all USF\u2019s partners and comembers of the Residency program\u2019s Advisory\nBoard.\n      In November 2022, Stanford filed its answer to USF\u2019s complaint along\nwith a cross-complaint. Community Initiatives filed a demurrer, which was\nvigorously opposed and ultimately denied on December 22. On December 14,\nwhile the demurrer was still pending, Community Initiatives filed a motion\nto disqualify Vartain from representing USF in the present action.\nCommunity Initiatives argued that Vartain\u2019s previous attorney-client\nrelationship with Community Initiatives in the Simon cases created a conflict\nof interest that Community Initiatives did not waive. Stanford filed a joinder\nin Community\u2019s Initiatives disqualification motion and USF filed vigorous\nopposition.\nThe Disqualification Order\n      On January 18 and 20, 2023, the trial court held a hearing before\ntaking the disqualification motion under submission. On January 23, the\ncourt disqualified Vartain from representing USF in the pending action,\nmemorializing its findings in a six-page order.\n      The trial court\u2019s analysis of the disqualification motion was framed by a\npreliminary finding that Vartain represented Community Initiatives in\nSimon\u2019s wrongful termination case. The court emphasized that Vartain\nsigned and filed Community Initiatives\u2019 successful petition to compel\narbitration, supporting memorandum, and reply brief, and all these court\nfilings identified Vartain as \u201c \u2018Attorneys for Defendant Community\nInitiatives.\u2019 \u201d The court made an additional finding that Vartain assisted\nCommunity Initiatives with \u201c \u2018getting released\u2019 \u201d from the qui tam case, which\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\fwas also brought by Simon and named Community Initiatives and USF as\ncodefendants.\n      Turning to the merits of the motion, the court applied a \u201c \u2018substantial\nrelationship\u2019 \u201d test, which courts use to evaluate alleged attorney conflicts\nthat arise from successive representation of clients with adverse interests.\n(Citing, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc. (2006)\n38 Cal.4th 839, 847 (Cobra Solutions).) Concluding that Community\nInitiatives made the requisite showing of a substantial relationship between\nVartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and their current\nrepresentation of USF, the court made two sets of material findings.\n      First, Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\ninitiatives during the prior actions. This finding was based on Michael\nVartain\u2019s personal involvement in successfully litigating Community\nInitiatives\u2019 arbitration petition, and the fact that the petition was the most\nimportant motion in the wrongful termination case because after that\npetition was granted \u201c \u2018[t]he case was over.\u2019 \u201d Simon \u201c \u2018never submitted the\ndispute to arbitrat[ion]\u2019 and instead dismissed it with prejudice.\u201d (Quoting\nMichael Vartain\u2019s declaration.) In addition, the court observed that after\nVartain obtained a positive outcome for Community Initiatives in the\nemployment termination case, they offered further assistance by helping to\nsecure a release from liability for Community Initiatives in the federal qui\ntam action.\n      Second, the court found that the Simon cases and the pending\nindemnity action are linked by their subject matter, as they involve\noverlapping parties and issues. As the court explained, the wrongful\ntermination case and USF\u2019s current indemnity action concern the same\nallegations of \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against Community Initiatives\u2014that it played a\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\frole in submitting falsified timesheets for AmeriCorps funding\u2014which is the\nsame conduct that led USF to settle Simon\u2019s qui tam action. After previously\ndefending Community Initiatives from those allegations, Vartain was now\nattempting to prove wrongdoing by Community Initiatives, and, the court\nfound, \u201cinformation material to the former representation and assistance is\nalso material to the subsequent representation.\u201d\n      The court found that because a substantial relationship exists between\nthe former representation and the current case, \u201cit is \u2018conclusively presumed\nthat [the] attorney knows confidential information adverse to [his or her]\nformer client.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting National Grange of Order of Patrons of Husbandry\nv. California Guild (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 706, 717 (National Grange).)\nUnder these circumstances, the court concluded, the substantial relationship\nbetween Vartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and the\nsubject matter of the current action mandates disqualifying Michael Vartain\nand his firm from representing USF in the pending case.\n      In reaching this disposition, the court rejected contentions by USF that\nCommunity Initiatives waived its right to seek disqualification of Vartain.\nSpecifically, USF argued that Community Initiatives consented to Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent representation of USF by signing the JDA in Simon\u2019s wrongful\ntermination action. The court disagreed, finding that the JDA pertained to\nthe sharing of information among codefendants, not to a waiver of future\nconflicts of interest. USF also argued that Community Initiatives was\nattempting to gain an unfair tactical advantage by bringing its motion after\n21 months\u2019 delay and causing extreme prejudice to USF. The court found\nthat \u201cdelay and any prejudice\u201d in bringing the motion \u201cwere minimal,\u201d\npointing out that the case began when Vartain sued SF Unified; that\nCommunity Initiative was later added as a defendant in the amended\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fcomplaint, which was not served until July 2022; discovery did not begin\nuntil November; and the disqualification motion was filed the following\nmonth.\n                                  DISCUSSION\n      \u201cThe authority of a trial court \u2018to disqualify an attorney derives from\nthe power inherent in every court \u201c[t]o control in furtherance of justice, the\nconduct of its ministerial officers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at\np. 846.) Disqualification motions implicate conflicts between the client\u2019s right\nto counsel of choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of\nprofessional responsibility, but the \u201c \u2018paramount concern must be to preserve\npublic trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of\nthe bar.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) We review the trial court\u2019s decision on a disqualification\nmotion for abuse of discretion, applying the deferential substantial evidence\ntest to any disputed findings of fact. (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v.\nSpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1143.) \u201cHowever,\nthe trial court\u2019s discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles,\u201d and \u201ca\ndisqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the\ntrial court\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d (Id. at p. 1144.)\nI. Issues on Appeal\n      Attorney disqualification matters typically arise from one of two\ncommon factual scenarios: successive representations, where an attorney\nseeks to represent a client with interests that are potentially adverse to a\nformer client; and concurrent representations, where an attorney seeks to\nsimultaneously represent clients with potentially or actually adverse\ninterests. (Flatt v. Superior Court (1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 283; Antelope Valley\nGroundwater Cases (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 602, 617 (Antelope Valley).)\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fCourts have developed distinct disqualification standards to address each\nscenario. (Flatt, at p. 283.)\n      In this case, we review a disqualification order that precludes Vartain\u2019s\nsuccessive representation of clients with adverse interests. \u201cIt is well\nestablished that an attorney, after severing his or her relationship with a\nclient, \u2018may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in\nany matter in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use\nagainst his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the\nprevious relationship.\u2019 [Citations.] This prohibition is grounded in both the\nCalifornia State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, former rule 3-310(E) in\neffect until November 1, 2018, and rule 1.9, effective November 1, 2018, and\ngoverning case law.\u201d (O\u2019Gara Coach Co., LLC v. Ra (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th\n1115, 1124.)\n      The \u201cenduring duty to preserve client confidences precludes an attorney\nfrom later agreeing to represent an adversary of the attorney\u2019s former client\nunless the former client provides an \u2018informed written consent\u2019 waiving the\nconflict.\u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847, quoting Rules Prof.\nConduct, former rule 3-310(E); see current rule 1.9 (citations to rules refer to\nthe California State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct).)1 \u201cIf the attorney\nfails to obtain such consent and undertakes to represent the adversary, the\nformer client may disqualify the attorney by showing a \u2018 \u201csubstantial\nrelationship\u201d \u2019 between the subjects of the prior and current representations.\u201d\n\n\n\n      1  In moving for Vartain\u2019s disqualification from this case, Community\nInitiatives relied specifically on rule 1.9(a), which states: \u201cA lawyer who has\nformerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent\nanother person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that\nperson\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client\nunless the former client gives informed written consent.\u201d\n\n                                       10\n\f(Cobra Solutions, at p. 847; see also Victaulic Co. v. American Home\nAssurance Co. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 485, 506 (Victaulic).) \u201cWhen a\nsubstantial relationship between the two representations is established, the\nattorney is automatically disqualified from representing the second client.\u201d\n(Cobra Solutions, at p. 847.)\n      On appeal, USF implicitly concedes that Community Initiatives is\nVartain\u2019s former client. But it contends the trial court abused its discretion\nby disqualifying Vartain because (1) there is no substantial relationship\nbetween the previous representation and the present action, and (2)\nCommunity Initiatives waived Vartain\u2019s conflict of interest. We reject both\narguments.\nII. Substantial Relationship Analysis\n      In Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th 847, the California Supreme\nCourt affirmed that the substantial relationship test should be used to\nevaluate disqualification issues in successive representation cases and\nsummarized the key features of this inquiry. The court \u201cmust first determine\nwhether the attorney had a direct professional relationship with the former\nclient in which the attorney personally provided legal advice and services on\na legal issue that is closely related to the legal issue in the present\nrepresentation. [Citation.] If the former representation involved such a\ndirect relationship with the client, the former client need not prove that the\nattorney possesses actual confidential information. [Citation.] Instead, the\nattorney is presumed to possess confidential information if the subject of the\nprior representation put the attorney in a position in which confidences\nmaterial to the current representation would normally have been imparted to\ncounsel.\u201d (Id. at p. 847; see also rule 1.9, comment 3 [two matters are\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fsubstantially related for purposes of this rule if they involve a substantial\nrisk of a violation of a duty owed to the former client].)\n      \u201cWhen the attorney\u2019s contact with the prior client was not direct, then\nthe court examines both the attorney\u2019s relationship to the prior client and the\nrelationship between the prior and the present representation. If the\nsubjects of the prior representation are such as to \u2018make it likely the attorney\nacquired confidential information\u2019 that is relevant and material to the\npresent representation, then the two representations are substantially\nrelated.\u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847.)\n      We conclude that the trial court correctly applied the principles set\nforth in Cobra Solutions, and its findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.2\n      The finding of a direct professional relationship between Vartain and\nCommunity Initiatives is supported by Michael Vartain\u2019s personal\nappearance on behalf of Community Initiatives in the wrongful termination\ncase, and the substantive legal services Vartain rendered to successfully\nlitigate the non-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF contends Vartain\u2019s\nprior representation of Community Initiatives was indirect and insubstantial\nbecause it was a limited appearance based on work Vartain had already put\ninto preparing USF\u2019s arbitration petition. In fact, the record shows that the\ntwo arbitration petitions presented distinct legal issues; USF\u2019s petition was\ngranted pursuant to an arbitration agreement, while the non-signatories\u2019\npetition was granted pursuant to principles of agency and estoppel.\nMoreover, the minute order from the hearing on the petitions reflects that\n\n\n\n      2  Although the trial court expressly relied on Cobra Solutions in\nreaching its conclusions, the case is not even mentioned in the appellate\nbriefs that Vartain prepared and filed on behalf of USF.\n\n                                        12\n\fUSF\u2019s petition was unopposed, while Community Initiatives\u2019 petition was\ncontested. Beyond that, as Michael Vartain conceded below, the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition was dispositive, leading directly to dismissal\nof the wrongful termination action.\n      USF argues that Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration conclusively shows\nthere was no direct prior relationship with Community Initiatives because\nMr. Vartain\u2019s only contact with Community Initiatives occurred prior to the\narbitration hearing, when he was briefly introduced to Community Initiatives\nVice President, David McGee. We are unpersuaded by this argument, which\nis premised on an untenably narrow conception of the word \u201cdirect.\u201d McGee,\nwho also filed a declaration in the lower court, recalled exchanging an email\nwith Michael Vartain and also having an in-person discussion with him about\nVartain\u2019s representation of Community Initiatives when they met before the\nhearing. Moreover, Michael Vartain acknowledged that he worked directly\nwith attorneys from Stanford\u2019s General Counsel office to draft the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF fails to diminish Vartain\u2019s role by\npointing out that Stanford\u2019s General Counsel also represented Community\nInitiatives. Vartain\u2019s collaboration with other lawyers who also represented\ntheir client is additional evidence of Vartain\u2019s direct representation of\nCommunity Initiatives in the wrongful termination case.\n      Substantial evidence also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the\nlegal services Vartain provided during their prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives involved a legal issue that is substantially related to\nthe legal issue in the pending action. Indeed, a pivotal issue in the wrongful\ntermination case underlies this indemnity action\u2014whether Community\nInitiatives is liable for problems in the administration of the Residency\nprogram, including the submission of false claims for AmeriCorps funding,\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\fand the alleged retaliatory discharge of Simon for reporting this misconduct.\nAfter previously defending Community Initiatives against these allegations,\nVartain now seeks to change sides and pursue those same allegations of\nwrongdoing against Community Initiatives.\n      In its reply brief, USF posits that these two matters are not sufficiently\nrelated to satisfy the substantial relationship test. We disagree. In the\nwrongful termination action, Simon\u2019s claims against Community Initiatives\nwere premised on agency allegations, including that Community Initiatives\nbecame his joint employer in October 2016, and that Community Initiatives\nconspired with USF to wrongfully terminate him in 2017 in retaliation for\nengaging in protected activity.3 Simon\u2019s allegedly protected activity included\nreporting violations of the False Claims Act, which was the same conduct at\nissue in Simon\u2019s qui tam case, the settlement of which gave rise to USF\u2019s\npending indemnity claims against Community Initiatives.\n      USF takes the position that the substantive nature of the wrongful\ntermination case is irrelevant since Vartain\u2019s representation of Community\nInitiatives was limited to the petition to arbitrate. To begin with, the record\ndoes not show that Vartain and Community Initiatives agreed to a limited\nscope representation. USF acknowledged at oral argument before this court\nthat Vartain did not file a form CIV-150 Notice of Limited Scope\nRepresentation. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.36.) And the declaration\nMichael Vartain filed in the wrongful termination case stated that he was\nappearing in court on behalf of the non-signatories\u2019 for a limited purpose but\ndid not address the nature or scope of Vartain\u2019s agreement to represent\n\n\n      3 According to USF, Simon\u2019s \u201caccusation of whistleblower retaliation\nwas specifically aimed at USF and not [Community Initiatives].\u201d Not so.\nEvery cause of action alleged against USF in the wrongful termination case\nwas also alleged against Community Initiatives.\n\n                                       14\n\fCommunity Initiatives. In any event, USF overlooks that the grounds for the\nnon-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition were the very agency allegations upon\nwhich Simon sought to hold Community Initiatives jointly liable for wrongful\ntermination in his employment case and for violating the False Claims Act in\nthe federal qui tam case. This factor connects not only Simon\u2019s two cases, but\nthe pending action in which USF seeks indemnity from Community\nInitiatives. Only this time, Vartain is not defending Community Initiatives\nagainst allegations of joint misconduct but attempting to hold it liable for\nthat precise reason.\n      Taking a different tack, USF argues that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by finding a substantial relationship between the qui tam action\nand the current action despite the fact that Vartain did not represent\nCommunity Initiatives in the qui tam action. This argument misconstrues\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, which did not parse out the qui tam case as an\nindependent basis for disqualification. Instead, the court found evidentiary\nsupport for Community Initiative\u2019s argument in the fact that after Vartain\nappeared in court as Community Initiative\u2019s lawyer in the wrongful\ntermination case, they provided additional assistance to Community\nInitiatives by obtaining its release in the qui tam case. This evidence\nreinforces that the two Simon cases and the present indemnity action are\ninterrelated, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s taking account\nof this fact.\n      Attempting to shore up its sufficiency of the evidence challenge, USF\ncontends that Community Initiatives failed to carry its burden of proof\nbecause there is no evidence that Vartain actually obtained relevant\nconfidential information about Community Initiatives. However, no such\nshowing is required when, as here, a substantial relationship exists between\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe former and current representation. (See e.g., National Grange, supra, 38\nCal.App.5th at p. 717; Henriksen v. Great American Savings & Loan (1992)\n11 Cal.App.4th 109, 114.) \u201cIf the former client establishes the existence of a\nsubstantial relationship between the two representations the court will\nconclusively presume that the attorney possesses confidential information\nadverse to the former client and order disqualification.\u201d (Henriksen, at\np. 114.) Indeed, \u201cwhere the lawyer was personally involved in providing legal\nadvice and services to the former client\u2014then it must be presumed that\nconfidential information has passed to the attorney and there cannot be any\ndelving into the specifics of the communications between the attorney and the\nformer client in an effort to show that the attorney did or did not receive\nconfidential information during the course of that relationship.\u201d (Jessen v.\nHartford Casualty Ins. Co. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 698, 709 (Jessen).)\n      Insisting that Vartain\u2019s prior relationship with Community Initiatives\ndoes not give rise to a presumption that confidences were shared, USF\nmistakenly relies on Victaulic, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th 485. In that protracted\ninsurance coverage litigation, the defendants filed a motion to disqualify the\nplaintiff\u2019s law firm on the ground that two lawyers who recently joined the\nfirm had\u2014several years earlier\u2014done work for the claims-handling arm of\nthe defendants\u2019 parent company. (Id. at p. 491.) An order denying\ndisqualification was affirmed on appeal pursuant to a detailed evidentiary\nanalysis that we need not recount here. Suffice it to say, both the trial and\nappellate court agreed that the defendants failed to prove that the two\nattorneys in question had a direct personal relationship with them, or even\nthat a prior attorney-client relationship existed. (Id. at pp. 501\u2013502 & 510.)\nWithout that showing, there was no presumption the attorneys possessed\nconfidential information. (Id. at p. 502; see also Cobra Solutions, supra, 38\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fCal.4th at p. 847.) For this reason, the Victaulic court also considered\nwhether other circumstances showed that it was likely the attorneys acquired\nconfidential information that was relevant and material to the current\nmatter, and again agreed with the trial court that the defendants failed to\nmake that showing. (Victaulic, at pp. 511\u2013514; see pp. 502\u2013503.)\n      In contrast to Victaulic, in the present case we review an order\ngranting disqualification, and because the trial court\u2019s findings are supported\nby substantial evidence, USF\u2019s heavy reliance on Victaulic is misplaced.\nUnlike that case, here a closer consideration of the nature of the prior\nrelationship was unnecessary once Community Services carried its burden of\nshowing that Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\nServices and personally provided legal advice and services in a\nrepresentation that is substantially related to the present action. As the trial\ncourt found, these facts give rise to a presumption Vartain possesses\nconfidential information, without the need for further proof that material\nconfidential information was likely conveyed. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38\nCal.4th at p. 847; Jessen, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at p. 709.)\nIII. Waiver Analysis\n      \u201cNot all conflicts of interest require disqualification. In some\nsituations, the attorney may still represent the client if the client\u2019s consent is\nobtained. [Citations.] \u2018Giving effect to a client\u2019s consent to a conflicting\nrepresentation might rest either on the ground of contract freedom or on the\nrelated ground of personal autonomy of a client to choose whatever champion\nthe client feels is best suited to vindicate the client\u2019s legal entitlements.\u2019 \u201d\n(Zador Corp. v. Kwan (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1295.)\n      Under the circumstances presented here, involving successive\nrepresentation of clients with adverse interests, Vartain may not represent\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fUSF in this action that is substantially related to its prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives without obtaining informed written consent waiving\nthe conflict. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847; rule 1.9(a).) USF\nargues that Vartain did obtain the requisite consent from Community\nInitiatives, and the trial court abused its discretion by finding otherwise. We\ndisagree.\n      USF bases its claim of error on the JDA that was executed in the\nwrongful termination case. As discussed in our background summary, the\nJDA is an agreement to share defense materials without waiving privileges\napplicable to those materials. The only attorney conflict that was waived in\nthe JDA is the conflict arising from access to joint defense materials that\nwere shared pursuant to that agreement. As the trial court found, the JDA\ndoes not address the type of conflict that arose when Vartain filed USF\u2019s\nindemnity complaint against their former client. USF\u2019s contrary view is not\nsupported by the language of the JDA or the factual circumstances. Indeed,\nit appears that when the JDA was executed by the parties\u2019 counsel on\nOctober 3, 2019, Vartain did not have an attorney-client relationship with\nCommunity Initiatives. However, in the ensuing weeks and months, Vartain\nappeared in court on behalf of Community Initiatives and provided additional\nassistance in the related qui tam case. Now, more than two years later,\nVartain seeks to sue its former client on behalf of USF. The JDA does not\nexpressly or implicitly address Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest. On its\nface, the JDA is not informed written consent to Vartain\u2019s current\nrepresentation of an adversary of their former client.\n      USF argues that the JDA should be construed as a waiver of Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent conflict because it shows that the parties in the wrongful termination\ncase did not have any expectation of confidentiality with respect to material\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthey exchanged under the JDA. This logic is flawed; the fact that USF and\nCommunity Initiatives agreed to share discrete information in the prior\nlitigation does mean there was a blanket waiver of attorney-client\nconfidentiality. By signing the JDA, the parties agreed expressly to waive\none specific right: to bring a disqualification motion based on the fact that\nthey shared defense materials. Evidence of that narrowly drawn waiver cuts\nagainst USF\u2019s theory here that all of Vartain\u2019s conflicts of interest were\nwaived by signing the JDA.\n      USF\u2019s other arguments pertaining to the JDA lack factual and legal\nsupport. For example, USF assumes that the trial court failed to consider\nevidence that the JDA was drafted by Stanford\u2019s general counsel, pointing\nout that ambiguities in a contract must be construed against the drafter. But\nUSF fails to identify ambiguous language in the JDA. Relatedly, USF\nintimates that the JDA contains a latent ambiguity, requiring consideration\nof extrinsic evidence to determine whether the agreement is a broad waiver of\nany potential conflict relating to Vartain\u2019s representation of USF. (Citing\nFremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,\n114.) However, extrinsic evidence is admissible only when it is relevant to\nsupport a reasonable interpretation of the contract. (Brown v. Goldstien\n(2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 418, 432\u2013433.) USF\u2019s extrinsic evidence consists of\nstatements in Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration to the effect that USF was\nunwilling to consent to Vartain\u2019s concurrent representation of Community\nInitiatives in the wrongful termination case unless the JDA contained a\nconflict of interest waiver.4 This evidence pertains to USF\u2019s motivation for\n\n\n      4Similar statements appear in a declaration by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nDonna Davis. Davis states that she \u201callowed\u201d Vartain to represent\nCommunity Initiatives as a \u201ccourtesy to Stanford\u201d because she viewed\nStanford\u2019s and Community Initiatives\u2019 signatures on the JDA as an\n\n                                       19\n\fwaiving Vartain\u2019s separate conflict arising out of Vartain\u2019s concurrent\nrepresentation of clients with potentially adverse interests in the wrongful\ntermination case. It does not support USF\u2019s theory here that the JDA can be\nconstrued reasonably as a blanket waiver of all future attorney conflicts in\ncases involving these parties.\n      Shifting focus, USF appears to contend that Community Initiatives\nimpliedly consented to Vartain\u2019s adverse representation of USF by agreeing\nto present a joint defense with USF in the wrongful termination action. We\nhave a few problems with this argument, beginning with Cobra Solutions,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847, which states that the former client\u2019s informed\nwritten consent is required to waive a conflict arising out of successive\nrepresentation of the former client\u2019s adversary in a substantially related\nmatter. We note, however, that the disputed issue in Cobra Solutions\npertained to vicarious disqualification; whether a city attorney\u2019s admitted\nconflict of interest required disqualification of the entire government office.\n(Id. at p. 848.) Because there was no contention in Cobra Solutions that the\nformer clients consented to the conflict, that decision does not squarely hold\nthat informed consent to an otherwise disqualifying attorney conflict must be\nin writing.\n      USF cites Antelope Valley, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at pp. 619\u2013624, for\nthe proposition that consent to an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest can be\nimplied. We note that the conflict of interest analyzed in Antelope Valley\narose from an attorney\u2019s concurrent representation of clients with adverse\ninterests (id. at pp. 616\u2013617), but even if the same analysis were to apply in\ncases of successive representation (see id. at pp. 619, 621\u2013625), we conclude\n\n\n\nassurance that those parties would have no basis for disqualifying Vartain\nfrom representing USF.\n\n                                       20\n\fthat Antelope Valley does not support USF\u2019s argument under the facts\npresented here.\n      Antelope Valley involved multiple consolidated lawsuits arising from a\nprotracted dispute about water rights. (Antelope Valley, supra, 30\nCal.App.5th at p. 608.) The law firm Best Best & Krieger, LLP (BB&K)\nundertook to represent a water district defendant in the consolidated\nproceedings, while it was simultaneously representing a water contractor in\nother matters. (Id. at pp. 609\u2013610.) The water contractor also had an\ninterest in the consolidated proceedings, and, at some point, it was named as\na cross-defendant by an unrelated party. The water contractor retained the\nBrunick law firm to represent it in the consolidated proceedings, while\ncontinuing to use BB&K to represent it in other matters. (Id. at p. 611.)\nMore than 10 years later, the water contractor terminated its relationship\nwith BB&K and filed a motion to disqualify BB&K from continuing to\nrepresent the water district in the consolidated proceedings, claiming for the\nfirst time that the concurrent representation was a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest. (Id. at p. 613.) The trial court denied the motion, finding that the\nwater contractor impliedly consented to BB&K\u2019s concurrent representation of\nthe water district by accepting BB&K\u2019s advice on other matters for more than\n10 years without ever objecting to the concurrent representation. (Id. at\npp. 613\u2013614.)\n      On appeal, the Antelope Valley court affirmed the order denying the\ndisqualification motion on two independent grounds. First, the finding that\nthe water contractor impliedly consented to the concurrent representations\nwas supported by substantial evidence. (Id. at pp. 618 & 625.) Rejecting a\ncontention that the absence of the water contractor\u2019s written consent was\ndispositive, the Antelope Valley court held that \u201ca trial court may deny a\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fdisqualification motion when it finds the moving party by its conduct gave\nknowing and informed consent to the concurrent representation of\nthemselves and another client.\u201d (Id. at p. 625.) Alternatively, the court\nfound that even if implied consent was insufficient, the water contractor\nwaived its right to bring a disqualification motion by failing to bring the\nmotion within a reasonable time. (Id. at pp. 625\u2013626.)\n      Like the Antelope Valley court, we affirm a trial court ruling on a\ndisqualification matter because it is supported by substantial evidence. If we\nwere to assume, as the Antelope Valley court did, that informed consent to an\notherwise disqualifying conflict of interest can be implied from conduct, that\nfactor would not alter our conclusion that the disqualification order is\nsupported by substantial evidence. In contrast to the situation in Antelope\nValley, in this case there is no concrete evidence that the party asserting a\nconflict of interest knowingly participated in the arrangement for years\nwithout objection. USF\u2019s theory that Community Initiatives impliedly\nconsented to Vartain\u2019s conflict is based on the same evidence that USF uses\nto argue express consent, i.e., the fact that Community Initiatives signed the\nJDA. As explained, the language of the JDA and the factual circumstances of\nthis case support finding that the JDA was an agreement to share defense\nevidence, not to waive all potential future attorney conflicts of interest.\n      USF contends that if Community Initiatives did not impliedly consent\nto Vartain\u2019s conflict, it impliedly waived its right to bring a motion to\ndisqualify Vartain. \u201c \u2018[A]ttorney disqualification can be impliedly waived by\nfailing to bring the motion in a timely manner.\u2019 [Citation.] As explained by\none court, \u2018it is not in the interests of justice to make the \u201csubstantial\nrelationship\u201d rule so unyielding as to permit the former client to inexcusably\npostpone objections without penalty. Therefore, a narrow exception should\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fapply if the present client, by way of opposition, offers prima facie evidence of\nan unreasonable delay by the former client in making the motion and\nresulting prejudice to the current client.\u2019 [Citation.] To operate as a waiver,\nhowever, the \u2018delay [and] . . . the prejudice to the opponent must be extreme.\u2019\n[Citations.] If the opposing party makes a prima facie showing of extreme\ndelay and prejudice, the burden then shifts to the moving party to justify the\ndelay.\u201d (Fiduciary Trust Internat. of California v. Superior Court (2013) 218\nCal.App.4th 465, 490.)\n      Consistent with these principles, the Antelope Valley court found\n\u201cample justification\u201d for finding that the water contractor\u2019s delay in bringing\na disqualification motion was unreasonable and extremely prejudicial.\n(Antelope Valley, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 626.) The court based this\nconclusion on evidence that the water contractor waited 10 years to bring the\nmotion while reaping \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d from BB&K\u2019s representation of\nthe water district during that same period; that the water district would\nsuffer substantial financial cost if required to replace BB&K; and that the\ncourts and other interested parties would also be harmed by BB&K\u2019s removal\nfrom the ongoing litigation. (Id. at p. 626.)\n      In contrast to Antelope Valley, in this case USF failed to make a prima\nfacie showing of unreasonable delay or extreme prejudice. Again, it relies\nprimarily on Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration. Mr. Vartain states that for\nseveral months before and after the current lawsuit was filed, he spent\nconsiderable time attempting to negotiate a settlement with the attorneys\nrepresenting Stanford and Community Initiatives, and nobody complained\nabout a conflict of interest. In our view, the time Vartain spent on settlement\nefforts on behalf of USF is not evidence that Community Initiatives engaged\nin unreasonable delay. The record contains ample evidence that once Vartain\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fmade the decision to sue its former client, Community Initiatives acted\npromptly to address Vartain\u2019s conflict. Community Initiatives was served\nwith process in July 2022 and filed its motion to disqualify Vartain five\nmonths later.\n         Regarding prejudice, Mr. Vartain posits that no other attorney can\nadequately replace him in the pending indemnity action. He states, for\nexample, that he represents USF in most if not all litigation that is filed in\nSan Francisco, that he has \u201cthousands of attorney hours of experience\nworking on this lawsuit,\u201d and that his institutional knowledge of USF is \u201cnot\nreplaceable.\u201d This glowing review is corroborated by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nbut it is not evidence of prejudice attributable to Community Initiatives.\nDespite Vartain\u2019s close relationship with USF, they elected to represent\nCommunity Initiatives in a prior, substantially related matter. Promptly\nafter Vartain\u2019s decision to sue Community Initiatives on behalf of USF in the\npending action, Community Initiatives asserted the conflict and filed a\ndisqualification motion. Thus, it neither consented to nor waived its right to\nobject to Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest.\n                                                DISPOSITION\n          The order is affirmed.

No. CGC22597932)\n           Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         This appeal arises from successive lawsuits relating to administration\nof the San Francisco Teacher Residency Program (Residency program).\nLoran Simon, a former employee of the Residency program, filed two prior\nlawsuits based on allegations that appellant University of San Francisco\n(USF) and respondent Community Initiatives fraudulently obtained federal\nfunding to administer the Residency program. In the present action, USF\nseeks indemnity from Community Initiatives for damages it incurred in\nconnection with the Simon litigation. This appeal is from an order\ndisqualifying Michael Vartain and Vartain Law Group (Vartain) from\nrepresenting USF in the pending indemnity action due to Vartain\u2019s prior\nrepresentation of Community Initiatives in the Simon lawsuits. We affirm\nthat order.\n\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                              BACKGROUND\nThe Prior Lawsuits\n      Simon\u2019s Complaints\n      In November 2016, Simon filed a federal action against USF and\nCommunity Initiatives under qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. At\nthe time, Simon was Assistant Director of the Residency program, which he\ndescribed as a training program for teachers to improve achievement of\nhistorically underserved students that was operated by five organizations:\nUSF; Community Initiatives; the San Francisco Unified School District (SF\nUnified); the Stanford University Teacher Education Program (Stanford); and\nUnited Educators of San Francisco. According to his complaint, Simon was\ninitially employed by USF in June 2014, and in September 2016 his\nemployment was transferred to Community Initiatives, a fiscal sponsor that\nassisted with administration of the Residency program.\n      Simon alleged that during his tenure as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program, USF and Community Initiatives submitted fraudulent\nclaims to obtain grant money from federal programs, including AmeriCorps\n(previously known as the Corporation for National and Community Services).\nAccording to the complaint, all teacher candidates who participated in the\nResidency program obtained an AmeriCorps stipend, as well as other\nfinancial benefits from their respective universities. Simon alleged that the\ndefendants failed to \u201ctrack\u201d the time and effort of these AmeriCorps\nparticipants and instead used falsified timesheets to obtain federal funding.\n      In June 2019, while his federal case was pending, Simon filed a state\ncourt action seeking damages for wrongful termination, naming multiple\ndefendants including USF, Community Initiatives, and Peter Williamson, a\nStanford faculty member who served as Chairman of the Residency\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\fprogram\u2019s Advisory Board. Simon alleged that on June 30, 2017, he was\nwrongfully terminated from his employment as Assistant Director of the\nResidency program in retaliation for engaging in protected activity, including\ncontesting racial discrimination, and reporting violations of the state and\nfederal False Claims Acts. Simon alleged that the defendants were all liable\nfor his wrongful termination as they were his joint employers and acted\ntogether to terminate him.\n      Arbitration Petitions In Simon\u2019s Wrongful Termination Case\n      On October 2, 2019, USF petitioned the superior court to compel\narbitration and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination action. Vartain drafted\nand filed the petition on behalf of USF. USF sought to compel arbitration\npursuant to a provision in its written employment agreement with Simon.\n      The following day, USF executed a Joint Defense and Confidentiality\nAgreement (JDA) with Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson. The\nstated purpose of the JDA was to \u201censure that exchanges and disclosures of\nconfidential, privileged, and otherwise protected information\u201d among the\nparties for purposes of pursuing a petition for an order to arbitrate were not\ninterpreted as a waiver of the confidential or privileged nature of the\ninformation that was disclosed. Michael Vartain signed the JDA on behalf of\nVartain as attorneys for USF, and Stanford\u2019s Vice President and General\nCounsel, Debra Zumwalt, signed the JDA as attorney for Williamson and\nCommunity Initiatives.\n      The terms of the JDA were set forth in 24 numbered paragraphs,\naddressing issues such as the type of material covered by the agreement, and\nongoing obligations of the parties and their counsel to protect the privileged\nnature of the shared material. Paragraph 11 addressed the subject of\ncontinued representation should a party to the JDA assert a claim against\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fanother party in the wrongful termination case or separate litigation. In that\nevent, the JDA states, \u201ceach attorney of any Party who has access to or\nreceives any Joint Defense Material shared under [the JDA] shall remain\nnonetheless qualified to continue to represent his or her client in the defense\nor pursuit of the claim(s).\u201d In paragraph 11, the parties also agreed to the\nfollowing: \u201cAny conflict of interest arising out of the sharing of Joint Defense\nMaterials under this Agreement is waived. Any right of any Party to move to\ndisqualify any attorney for any Party to this Agreement on the grounds that\nsuch attorney has received Joint Defense Materials shared under this\nAgreement is waived.\u201d\n      On October 4, 2019, Community Initiatives and Peter Williamson filed\na petition for an order to arbitrate and stay Simon\u2019s wrongful termination\ncomplaint (the non-signatories\u2019 petition). The non-signatories\u2019 petition and\nsupporting documents were signed by Vartain as attorneys for Community\nInitiatives and Williamson. Michael Vartain filed a supporting declaration,\nwhich stated that he was appearing on behalf of Community Initiatives and\nWilliamson for the limited purpose of filing and arguing their arbitration\npetition. In a supporting memorandum, Vartain argued that USF\u2019s\narbitration agreement encompassed Simon\u2019s entire complaint, that Simon\nwas estopped from refusing to arbitrate his claims against Community\nInitiatives and other entity defendants, and that the arbitration agreement\napplied to Williamson and other individual defendants pursuant to principles\nof agency.\n      On November 1, 2019, the superior court held a hearing on both\narbitration petitions. USF\u2019s petition was granted pursuant to an uncontested\ntentative ruling that Simon\u2019s broad arbitration agreement with USF applied\nto his employment law claims. Simon contested a tentative ruling to grant\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fthe non-signatories\u2019 petition, but after the matter was argued, the court\ngranted that petition as well.\n      Dismissals of Simon\u2019s Lawsuits\n      The Simon lawsuits were both resolved in May 2020. On May 18, the\nUnited States government intervened in the qui tam action \u201cfor settlement\npurposes against defendant [USF].\u201d During negotiations between the\ngovernment and USF, Vartain requested that a contemplated release of\nSimon\u2019s qui tam claims also include Community Initiatives, and the\ngovernment agreed to the request. On May 18, the United States and Simon\nfiled a joint proposed dismissal of the qui tam action with prejudice. The\norder was filed May 21, confirming Simon\u2019s dismissal extended to all\ndefendants. The United States dismissed Simon\u2019s claims with prejudice to\nthe extent they were \u201cbrought against USF under the False Claims Act,\narising from USF\u2019s status as the fiscal agent which applied AmeriCorps funds\nto support and administer the [Residency program] during the 2014, 2015,\nand 2016 grant years.\u201d The following week, on May 27, Simon dismissed his\nwrongful termination case, serving notice of the dismissal on Vartain as\nattorneys for USF, Community Initiatives, and Williamson.\nThe Current Indemnity Action\n      In February 2022, USF, represented by Vartain, filed the underlying\naction for contractual and equitable indemnity and declaratory relief, seeking\nto recover more than $4.5 million as damages it incurred to settle the qui tam\naction. USF alleges that its liability in the Simon cases was based solely on\nconduct by the Residency program\u2019s manager, who was the employee and\nagent of SF Unified. In its original complaint, USF named SF Unified as the\nsole defendant, but its operative first amended complaint names Community\nInitiatives and Stanford as additional defendants. USF\u2019s pleaded theory is\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fthat each defendant must indemnify USF in proportion to its relative fault\nrelating to the fraudulent procurement of AmeriCorps funds because they\nwere all USF\u2019s partners and comembers of the Residency program\u2019s Advisory\nBoard.\n      In November 2022, Stanford filed its answer to USF\u2019s complaint along\nwith a cross-complaint. Community Initiatives filed a demurrer, which was\nvigorously opposed and ultimately denied on December 22. On December 14,\nwhile the demurrer was still pending, Community Initiatives filed a motion\nto disqualify Vartain from representing USF in the present action.\nCommunity Initiatives argued that Vartain\u2019s previous attorney-client\nrelationship with Community Initiatives in the Simon cases created a conflict\nof interest that Community Initiatives did not waive. Stanford filed a joinder\nin Community\u2019s Initiatives disqualification motion and USF filed vigorous\nopposition.\nThe Disqualification Order\n      On January 18 and 20, 2023, the trial court held a hearing before\ntaking the disqualification motion under submission. On January 23, the\ncourt disqualified Vartain from representing USF in the pending action,\nmemorializing its findings in a six-page order.\n      The trial court\u2019s analysis of the disqualification motion was framed by a\npreliminary finding that Vartain represented Community Initiatives in\nSimon\u2019s wrongful termination case. The court emphasized that Vartain\nsigned and filed Community Initiatives\u2019 successful petition to compel\narbitration, supporting memorandum, and reply brief, and all these court\nfilings identified Vartain as \u201c \u2018Attorneys for Defendant Community\nInitiatives.\u2019 \u201d The court made an additional finding that Vartain assisted\nCommunity Initiatives with \u201c \u2018getting released\u2019 \u201d from the qui tam case, which\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\fwas also brought by Simon and named Community Initiatives and USF as\ncodefendants.\n      Turning to the merits of the motion, the court applied a \u201c \u2018substantial\nrelationship\u2019 \u201d test, which courts use to evaluate alleged attorney conflicts\nthat arise from successive representation of clients with adverse interests.\n(Citing, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc. (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639581/city-county-of-san-francisco-v-cobra-solutions-inc/\">38 Cal.4th 839</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (Cobra Solutions).) Concluding that Community\nInitiatives made the requisite showing of a substantial relationship between\nVartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and their current\nrepresentation of USF, the court made two sets of material findings.\n      First, Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\ninitiatives during the prior actions. This finding was based on Michael\nVartain\u2019s personal involvement in successfully litigating Community\nInitiatives\u2019 arbitration petition, and the fact that the petition was the most\nimportant motion in the wrongful termination case because after that\npetition was granted \u201c \u2018[t]he case was over.\u2019 \u201d Simon \u201c \u2018never submitted the\ndispute to arbitrat[ion]\u2019 and instead dismissed it with prejudice.\u201d (Quoting\nMichael Vartain\u2019s declaration.) In addition, the court observed that after\nVartain obtained a positive outcome for Community Initiatives in the\nemployment termination case, they offered further assistance by helping to\nsecure a release from liability for Community Initiatives in the federal qui\ntam action.\n      Second, the court found that the Simon cases and the pending\nindemnity action are linked by their subject matter, as they involve\noverlapping parties and issues. As the court explained, the wrongful\ntermination case and USF\u2019s current indemnity action concern the same\nallegations of \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against Community Initiatives\u2014that it played a\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\frole in submitting falsified timesheets for AmeriCorps funding\u2014which is the\nsame conduct that led USF to settle Simon\u2019s qui tam action. After previously\ndefending Community Initiatives from those allegations, Vartain was now\nattempting to prove wrongdoing by Community Initiatives, and, the court\nfound, \u201cinformation material to the former representation and assistance is\nalso material to the subsequent representation.\u201d\n      The court found that because a substantial relationship exists between\nthe former representation and the current case, \u201cit is \u2018conclusively presumed\nthat [the] attorney knows confidential information adverse to [his or her]\nformer client.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting National Grange of Order of Patrons of Husbandry\nv. California Guild (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107647\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240683/natl-grange-the-order-of-patrons-of-husbandry-v-guild/\">38 Cal.App.5th 706</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717 (National Grange).)\nUnder these circumstances, the court concluded, the substantial relationship\nbetween Vartain\u2019s former representation of Community Initiatives and the\nsubject matter of the current action mandates disqualifying Michael Vartain\nand his firm from representing USF in the pending case.\n      In reaching this disposition, the court rejected contentions by USF that\nCommunity Initiatives waived its right to seek disqualification of Vartain.\nSpecifically, USF argued that Community Initiatives consented to Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent representation of USF by signing the JDA in Simon\u2019s wrongful\ntermination action. The court disagreed, finding that the JDA pertained to\nthe sharing of information among codefendants, not to a waiver of future\nconflicts of interest. USF also argued that Community Initiatives was\nattempting to gain an unfair tactical advantage by bringing its motion after\n21 months\u2019 delay and causing extreme prejudice to USF. The court found\nthat \u201cdelay and any prejudice\u201d in bringing the motion \u201cwere minimal,\u201d\npointing out that the case began when Vartain sued SF Unified; that\nCommunity Initiative was later added as a defendant in the amended\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fcomplaint, which was not served until July 2022; discovery did not begin\nuntil November; and the disqualification motion was filed the following\nmonth.\n                                  DISCUSSION\n      \u201cThe authority of a trial court \u2018to disqualify an attorney derives from\nthe power inherent in every court \u201c[t]o control in furtherance of justice, the\nconduct of its ministerial officers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at\np. 846.) Disqualification motions implicate conflicts between the client\u2019s right\nto counsel of choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of\nprofessional responsibility, but the \u201c \u2018paramount concern must be to preserve\npublic trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of\nthe bar.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) We review the trial court\u2019s decision on a disqualification\nmotion for abuse of discretion, applying the deferential substantial evidence\ntest to any disputed findings of fact. (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v.\nSpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">20 Cal.4th 1135</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1143.) \u201cHowever,\nthe trial court\u2019s discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles,\u201d and \u201ca\ndisqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the\ntrial court\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d (Id. at p. 1144.)\nI. Issues on Appeal\n      Attorney disqualification matters typically arise from one of two\ncommon factual scenarios: successive representations, where an attorney\nseeks to represent a client with interests that are potentially adverse to a\nformer client; and concurrent representations, where an attorney seeks to\nsimultaneously represent clients with potentially or actually adverse\ninterests.

(Flatt, at p. 283.)\n      In this case, we review a disqualification order that precludes Vartain\u2019s\nsuccessive representation of clients with adverse interests. \u201cIt is well\nestablished that an attorney, after severing his or her relationship with a\nclient, \u2018may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in\nany matter in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use\nagainst his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the\nprevious relationship.\u2019 [Citations.] This prohibition is grounded in both the\nCalifornia State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, former rule 3-310(E) in\neffect until November 1, 2018, and rule 1.9, effective November 1, 2018, and\ngoverning case law.\u201d (O\u2019Gara Coach Co., LLC v.

But it contends the trial court abused its discretion\nby disqualifying Vartain because (1) there is no substantial relationship\nbetween the previous representation and the present action, and (2)\nCommunity Initiatives waived Vartain\u2019s conflict of interest. We reject both\narguments.\nII. Substantial Relationship Analysis\n      In Cobra Solutions, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 Cal.4th 847</span><pre class=\"inline\">, the California Supreme\nCourt affirmed that the substantial relationship test should be used to\nevaluate disqualification issues in successive representation cases and\nsummarized the key features of this inquiry. The court \u201cmust first determine\nwhether the attorney had a direct professional relationship with the former\nclient in which the attorney personally provided legal advice and services on\na legal issue that is closely related to the legal issue in the present\nrepresentation. [Citation.] If the former representation involved such a\ndirect relationship with the client, the former client need not prove that the\nattorney possesses actual confidential information. [Citation.] Instead, the\nattorney is presumed to possess confidential information if the subject of the\nprior representation put the attorney in a position in which confidences\nmaterial to the current representation would normally have been imparted to\ncounsel.\u201d (Id. at p. 847; see also rule 1.9, comment 3 [two matters are\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fsubstantially related for purposes of this rule if they involve a substantial\nrisk of a violation of a duty owed to the former client].)\n      \u201cWhen the attorney\u2019s contact with the prior client was not direct, then\nthe court examines both the attorney\u2019s relationship to the prior client and the\nrelationship between the prior and the present representation. If the\nsubjects of the prior representation are such as to \u2018make it likely the attorney\nacquired confidential information\u2019 that is relevant and material to the\npresent representation, then the two representations are substantially\nrelated.\u201d (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847.)\n      We conclude that the trial court correctly applied the principles set\nforth in Cobra Solutions, and its findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.2\n      The finding of a direct professional relationship between Vartain and\nCommunity Initiatives is supported by Michael Vartain\u2019s personal\nappearance on behalf of Community Initiatives in the wrongful termination\ncase, and the substantive legal services Vartain rendered to successfully\nlitigate the non-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF contends Vartain\u2019s\nprior representation of Community Initiatives was indirect and insubstantial\nbecause it was a limited appearance based on work Vartain had already put\ninto preparing USF\u2019s arbitration petition. In fact, the record shows that the\ntwo arbitration petitions presented distinct legal issues; USF\u2019s petition was\ngranted pursuant to an arbitration agreement, while the non-signatories\u2019\npetition was granted pursuant to principles of agency and estoppel.\nMoreover, the minute order from the hearing on the petitions reflects that\n\n\n\n      2  Although the trial court expressly relied on Cobra Solutions in\nreaching its conclusions, the case is not even mentioned in the appellate\nbriefs that Vartain prepared and filed on behalf of USF.\n\n                                        12\n\fUSF\u2019s petition was unopposed, while Community Initiatives\u2019 petition was\ncontested. Beyond that, as Michael Vartain conceded below, the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition was dispositive, leading directly to dismissal\nof the wrongful termination action.\n      USF argues that Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration conclusively shows\nthere was no direct prior relationship with Community Initiatives because\nMr. Vartain\u2019s only contact with Community Initiatives occurred prior to the\narbitration hearing, when he was briefly introduced to Community Initiatives\nVice President, David McGee. We are unpersuaded by this argument, which\nis premised on an untenably narrow conception of the word \u201cdirect.\u201d McGee,\nwho also filed a declaration in the lower court, recalled exchanging an email\nwith Michael Vartain and also having an in-person discussion with him about\nVartain\u2019s representation of Community Initiatives when they met before the\nhearing. Moreover, Michael Vartain acknowledged that he worked directly\nwith attorneys from Stanford\u2019s General Counsel office to draft the non-\nsignatories\u2019 arbitration petition. USF fails to diminish Vartain\u2019s role by\npointing out that Stanford\u2019s General Counsel also represented Community\nInitiatives. Vartain\u2019s collaboration with other lawyers who also represented\ntheir client is additional evidence of Vartain\u2019s direct representation of\nCommunity Initiatives in the wrongful termination case.\n      Substantial evidence also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the\nlegal services Vartain provided during their prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives involved a legal issue that is substantially related to\nthe legal issue in the pending action. Indeed, a pivotal issue in the wrongful\ntermination case underlies this indemnity action\u2014whether Community\nInitiatives is liable for problems in the administration of the Residency\nprogram, including the submission of false claims for AmeriCorps funding,\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\fand the alleged retaliatory discharge of Simon for reporting this misconduct.\nAfter previously defending Community Initiatives against these allegations,\nVartain now seeks to change sides and pursue those same allegations of\nwrongdoing against Community Initiatives.\n      In its reply brief, USF posits that these two matters are not sufficiently\nrelated to satisfy the substantial relationship test. We disagree. In the\nwrongful termination action, Simon\u2019s claims against Community Initiatives\nwere premised on agency allegations, including that Community Initiatives\nbecame his joint employer in October 2016, and that Community Initiatives\nconspired with USF to wrongfully terminate him in 2017 in retaliation for\nengaging in protected activity.3 Simon\u2019s allegedly protected activity included\nreporting violations of the False Claims Act, which was the same conduct at\nissue in Simon\u2019s qui tam case, the settlement of which gave rise to USF\u2019s\npending indemnity claims against Community Initiatives.\n      USF takes the position that the substantive nature of the wrongful\ntermination case is irrelevant since Vartain\u2019s representation of Community\nInitiatives was limited to the petition to arbitrate. To begin with, the record\ndoes not show that Vartain and Community Initiatives agreed to a limited\nscope representation. USF acknowledged at oral argument before this court\nthat Vartain did not file a form CIV-150 Notice of Limited Scope\nRepresentation. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.36.) And the declaration\nMichael Vartain filed in the wrongful termination case stated that he was\nappearing in court on behalf of the non-signatories\u2019 for a limited purpose but\ndid not address the nature or scope of Vartain\u2019s agreement to represent\n\n\n      3 According to USF, Simon\u2019s \u201caccusation of whistleblower retaliation\nwas specifically aimed at USF and not [Community Initiatives].\u201d Not so.\nEvery cause of action alleged against USF in the wrongful termination case\nwas also alleged against Community Initiatives.\n\n                                       14\n\fCommunity Initiatives. In any event, USF overlooks that the grounds for the\nnon-signatories\u2019 arbitration petition were the very agency allegations upon\nwhich Simon sought to hold Community Initiatives jointly liable for wrongful\ntermination in his employment case and for violating the False Claims Act in\nthe federal qui tam case. This factor connects not only Simon\u2019s two cases, but\nthe pending action in which USF seeks indemnity from Community\nInitiatives. Only this time, Vartain is not defending Community Initiatives\nagainst allegations of joint misconduct but attempting to hold it liable for\nthat precise reason.\n      Taking a different tack, USF argues that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by finding a substantial relationship between the qui tam action\nand the current action despite the fact that Vartain did not represent\nCommunity Initiatives in the qui tam action. This argument misconstrues\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, which did not parse out the qui tam case as an\nindependent basis for disqualification. Instead, the court found evidentiary\nsupport for Community Initiative\u2019s argument in the fact that after Vartain\nappeared in court as Community Initiative\u2019s lawyer in the wrongful\ntermination case, they provided additional assistance to Community\nInitiatives by obtaining its release in the qui tam case. This evidence\nreinforces that the two Simon cases and the present indemnity action are\ninterrelated, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s taking account\nof this fact.\n      Attempting to shore up its sufficiency of the evidence challenge, USF\ncontends that Community Initiatives failed to carry its burden of proof\nbecause there is no evidence that Vartain actually obtained relevant\nconfidential information about Community Initiatives. However, no such\nshowing is required when, as here, a substantial relationship exists between\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe former and current representation. (See e.g., National Grange, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107647\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240683/natl-grange-the-order-of-patrons-of-husbandry-v-guild/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 38\nCal.App.5th at p. 717; Henriksen v.

Indeed, \u201cwhere the lawyer was personally involved in providing legal\nadvice and services to the former client\u2014then it must be presumed that\nconfidential information has passed to the attorney and there cannot be any\ndelving into the specifics of the communications between the attorney and the\nformer client in an effort to show that the attorney did or did not receive\nconfidential information during the course of that relationship.\u201d (Jessen v.\nHartford Casualty Ins.

In that protracted\ninsurance coverage litigation, the defendants filed a motion to disqualify the\nplaintiff\u2019s law firm on the ground that two lawyers who recently joined the\nfirm had\u2014several years earlier\u2014done work for the claims-handling arm of\nthe defendants\u2019 parent company. (Id. at p. 491.) An order denying\ndisqualification was affirmed on appeal pursuant to a detailed evidentiary\nanalysis that we need not recount here. Suffice it to say, both the trial and\nappellate court agreed that the defendants failed to prove that the two\nattorneys in question had a direct personal relationship with them, or even\nthat a prior attorney-client relationship existed. (Id. at pp. 501\u2013502 &amp; 510.)\nWithout that showing, there was no presumption the attorneys possessed\nconfidential information. (Id. at p. 502; see also Cobra Solutions, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639581/city-county-of-san-francisco-v-cobra-solutions-inc/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 38\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fCal.4th at p. 847.) For this reason, the Victaulic court also considered\nwhether other circumstances showed that it was likely the attorneys acquired\nconfidential information that was relevant and material to the current\nmatter, and again agreed with the trial court that the defendants failed to\nmake that showing. (Victaulic, at pp. 511\u2013514; see pp. 502\u2013503.)\n      In contrast to Victaulic, in the present case we review an order\ngranting disqualification, and because the trial court\u2019s findings are supported\nby substantial evidence, USF\u2019s heavy reliance on Victaulic is misplaced.\nUnlike that case, here a closer consideration of the nature of the prior\nrelationship was unnecessary once Community Services carried its burden of\nshowing that Vartain had a direct professional relationship with Community\nServices and personally provided legal advice and services in a\nrepresentation that is substantially related to the present action. As the trial\ncourt found, these facts give rise to a presumption Vartain possesses\nconfidential information, without the need for further proof that material\nconfidential information was likely conveyed. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38\nCal.4th at p. 847; Jessen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271101\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271101/jessen-v-hartford-cas-ins-co/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 111 Cal.App.4th at p. 709.)\nIII. Waiver Analysis\n      \u201cNot all conflicts of interest require disqualification. In some\nsituations, the attorney may still represent the client if the client\u2019s consent is\nobtained. [Citations.] \u2018Giving effect to a client\u2019s consent to a conflicting\nrepresentation might rest either on the ground of contract freedom or on the\nrelated ground of personal autonomy of a client to choose whatever champion\nthe client feels is best suited to vindicate the client\u2019s legal entitlements.\u2019 \u201d\n(Zador Corp. v. Kwan (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2263029\"><a href=\"/opinion/2263029/zador-corp-v-kwan/\">31 Cal.App.4th 1285</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1295.)\n      Under the circumstances presented here, involving successive\nrepresentation of clients with adverse interests, Vartain may not represent\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fUSF in this action that is substantially related to its prior representation of\nCommunity Initiatives without obtaining informed written consent waiving\nthe conflict. (Cobra Solutions, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847; rule 1.9(a).) USF\nargues that Vartain did obtain the requisite consent from Community\nInitiatives, and the trial court abused its discretion by finding otherwise. We\ndisagree.\n      USF bases its claim of error on the JDA that was executed in the\nwrongful termination case. As discussed in our background summary, the\nJDA is an agreement to share defense materials without waiving privileges\napplicable to those materials. The only attorney conflict that was waived in\nthe JDA is the conflict arising from access to joint defense materials that\nwere shared pursuant to that agreement. As the trial court found, the JDA\ndoes not address the type of conflict that arose when Vartain filed USF\u2019s\nindemnity complaint against their former client. USF\u2019s contrary view is not\nsupported by the language of the JDA or the factual circumstances. Indeed,\nit appears that when the JDA was executed by the parties\u2019 counsel on\nOctober 3, 2019, Vartain did not have an attorney-client relationship with\nCommunity Initiatives. However, in the ensuing weeks and months, Vartain\nappeared in court on behalf of Community Initiatives and provided additional\nassistance in the related qui tam case. Now, more than two years later,\nVartain seeks to sue its former client on behalf of USF. The JDA does not\nexpressly or implicitly address Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest. On its\nface, the JDA is not informed written consent to Vartain\u2019s current\nrepresentation of an adversary of their former client.\n      USF argues that the JDA should be construed as a waiver of Vartain\u2019s\ncurrent conflict because it shows that the parties in the wrongful termination\ncase did not have any expectation of confidentiality with respect to material\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthey exchanged under the JDA. This logic is flawed; the fact that USF and\nCommunity Initiatives agreed to share discrete information in the prior\nlitigation does mean there was a blanket waiver of attorney-client\nconfidentiality. By signing the JDA, the parties agreed expressly to waive\none specific right: to bring a disqualification motion based on the fact that\nthey shared defense materials. Evidence of that narrowly drawn waiver cuts\nagainst USF\u2019s theory here that all of Vartain\u2019s conflicts of interest were\nwaived by signing the JDA.\n      USF\u2019s other arguments pertaining to the JDA lack factual and legal\nsupport. For example, USF assumes that the trial court failed to consider\nevidence that the JDA was drafted by Stanford\u2019s general counsel, pointing\nout that ambiguities in a contract must be construed against the drafter. But\nUSF fails to identify ambiguous language in the JDA. Relatedly, USF\nintimates that the JDA contains a latent ambiguity, requiring consideration\nof extrinsic evidence to determine whether the agreement is a broad waiver of\nany potential conflict relating to Vartain\u2019s representation of USF. (Citing\nFremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271725\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271725/fremont-indemnity-co-v-fremont-general-corp/\">148 Cal.App.4th 97</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n114.) However, extrinsic evidence is admissible only when it is relevant to\nsupport a reasonable interpretation of the contract. (Brown v. Goldstien\n(2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107367\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240422/brown-v-goldstein/\">34 Cal.App.5th 418</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432\u2013433.) USF\u2019s extrinsic evidence consists of\nstatements in Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration to the effect that USF was\nunwilling to consent to Vartain\u2019s concurrent representation of Community\nInitiatives in the wrongful termination case unless the JDA contained a\nconflict of interest waiver.4 This evidence pertains to USF\u2019s motivation for\n\n\n      4Similar statements appear in a declaration by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nDonna Davis. Davis states that she \u201callowed\u201d Vartain to represent\nCommunity Initiatives as a \u201ccourtesy to Stanford\u201d because she viewed\nStanford\u2019s and Community Initiatives\u2019 signatures on the JDA as an\n\n                                       19\n\fwaiving Vartain\u2019s separate conflict arising out of Vartain\u2019s concurrent\nrepresentation of clients with potentially adverse interests in the wrongful\ntermination case. It does not support USF\u2019s theory here that the JDA can be\nconstrued reasonably as a blanket waiver of all future attorney conflicts in\ncases involving these parties.\n      Shifting focus, USF appears to contend that Community Initiatives\nimpliedly consented to Vartain\u2019s adverse representation of USF by agreeing\nto present a joint defense with USF in the wrongful termination action. We\nhave a few problems with this argument, beginning with Cobra Solutions,\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 847, which states that the former client\u2019s informed\nwritten consent is required to waive a conflict arising out of successive\nrepresentation of the former client\u2019s adversary in a substantially related\nmatter. We note, however, that the disputed issue in Cobra Solutions\npertained to vicarious disqualification; whether a city attorney\u2019s admitted\nconflict of interest required disqualification of the entire government office.\n(Id. at p. 848.) Because there was no contention in Cobra Solutions that the\nformer clients consented to the conflict, that decision does not squarely hold\nthat informed consent to an otherwise disqualifying attorney conflict must be\nin writing.\n      USF cites Antelope Valley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107071\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240138/antelope-valley-groundwater-cases-antelope-valley-east-kern-water-agency-v/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 30 Cal.App.5th at pp. 619\u2013624, for\nthe proposition that consent to an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest can be\nimplied. We note that the conflict of interest analyzed in Antelope Valley\narose from an attorney\u2019s concurrent representation of clients with adverse\ninterests (id. at pp. 616\u2013617), but even if the same analysis were to apply in\ncases of successive representation (see id. at pp. 619, 621\u2013625), we conclude\n\n\n\nassurance that those parties would have no basis for disqualifying Vartain\nfrom representing USF.\n\n                                       20\n\fthat Antelope Valley does not support USF\u2019s argument under the facts\npresented here.\n      Antelope Valley involved multiple consolidated lawsuits arising from a\nprotracted dispute about water rights.

The law firm Best Best &amp; Krieger, LLP (BB&amp;K)\nundertook to represent a water district defendant in the consolidated\nproceedings, while it was simultaneously representing a water contractor in\nother matters. (Id. at pp. 609\u2013610.) The water contractor also had an\ninterest in the consolidated proceedings, and, at some point, it was named as\na cross-defendant by an unrelated party. The water contractor retained the\nBrunick law firm to represent it in the consolidated proceedings, while\ncontinuing to use BB&amp;K to represent it in other matters. (Id. at p. 611.)\nMore than 10 years later, the water contractor terminated its relationship\nwith BB&amp;K and filed a motion to disqualify BB&amp;K from continuing to\nrepresent the water district in the consolidated proceedings, claiming for the\nfirst time that the concurrent representation was a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest. (Id. at p. 613.) The trial court denied the motion, finding that the\nwater contractor impliedly consented to BB&amp;K\u2019s concurrent representation of\nthe water district by accepting BB&amp;K\u2019s advice on other matters for more than\n10 years without ever objecting to the concurrent representation. (Id. at\npp. 613\u2013614.)\n      On appeal, the Antelope Valley court affirmed the order denying the\ndisqualification motion on two independent grounds. First, the finding that\nthe water contractor impliedly consented to the concurrent representations\nwas supported by substantial evidence. (Id. at pp. 618 &amp; 625.) Rejecting a\ncontention that the absence of the water contractor\u2019s written consent was\ndispositive, the Antelope Valley court held that \u201ca trial court may deny a\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fdisqualification motion when it finds the moving party by its conduct gave\nknowing and informed consent to the concurrent representation of\nthemselves and another client.\u201d (Id. at p. 625.) Alternatively, the court\nfound that even if implied consent was insufficient, the water contractor\nwaived its right to bring a disqualification motion by failing to bring the\nmotion within a reasonable time. (Id. at pp. 625\u2013626.)\n      Like the Antelope Valley court, we affirm a trial court ruling on a\ndisqualification matter because it is supported by substantial evidence. If we\nwere to assume, as the Antelope Valley court did, that informed consent to an\notherwise disqualifying conflict of interest can be implied from conduct, that\nfactor would not alter our conclusion that the disqualification order is\nsupported by substantial evidence. In contrast to the situation in Antelope\nValley, in this case there is no concrete evidence that the party asserting a\nconflict of interest knowingly participated in the arrangement for years\nwithout objection. USF\u2019s theory that Community Initiatives impliedly\nconsented to Vartain\u2019s conflict is based on the same evidence that USF uses\nto argue express consent, i.e., the fact that Community Initiatives signed the\nJDA. As explained, the language of the JDA and the factual circumstances of\nthis case support finding that the JDA was an agreement to share defense\nevidence, not to waive all potential future attorney conflicts of interest.\n      USF contends that if Community Initiatives did not impliedly consent\nto Vartain\u2019s conflict, it impliedly waived its right to bring a motion to\ndisqualify Vartain. \u201c \u2018[A]ttorney disqualification can be impliedly waived by\nfailing to bring the motion in a timely manner.\u2019 [Citation.] As explained by\none court, \u2018it is not in the interests of justice to make the \u201csubstantial\nrelationship\u201d rule so unyielding as to permit the former client to inexcusably\npostpone objections without penalty. Therefore, a narrow exception should\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fapply if the present client, by way of opposition, offers prima facie evidence of\nan unreasonable delay by the former client in making the motion and\nresulting prejudice to the current client.\u2019 [Citation.] To operate as a waiver,\nhowever, the \u2018delay [and] . . . the prejudice to the opponent must be extreme.\u2019\n[Citations.] If the opposing party makes a prima facie showing of extreme\ndelay and prejudice, the burden then shifts to the moving party to justify the\ndelay.\u201d (Fiduciary Trust Internat. of California v. Superior Court (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1037146\"><a href=\"/opinion/1037146/fiduciary-trust-international-v-superior-court/\">218\nCal.App.4th 465</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490.)\n      Consistent with these principles, the Antelope Valley court found\n\u201cample justification\u201d for finding that the water contractor\u2019s delay in bringing\na disqualification motion was unreasonable and extremely prejudicial.\n(Antelope Valley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107071\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240138/antelope-valley-groundwater-cases-antelope-valley-east-kern-water-agency-v/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 626.) The court based this\nconclusion on evidence that the water contractor waited 10 years to bring the\nmotion while reaping \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d from BB&amp;K\u2019s representation of\nthe water district during that same period; that the water district would\nsuffer substantial financial cost if required to replace BB&amp;K; and that the\ncourts and other interested parties would also be harmed by BB&amp;K\u2019s removal\nfrom the ongoing litigation. (Id. at p. 626.)\n      In contrast to Antelope Valley, in this case USF failed to make a prima\nfacie showing of unreasonable delay or extreme prejudice. Again, it relies\nprimarily on Michael Vartain\u2019s declaration. Mr. Vartain states that for\nseveral months before and after the current lawsuit was filed, he spent\nconsiderable time attempting to negotiate a settlement with the attorneys\nrepresenting Stanford and Community Initiatives, and nobody complained\nabout a conflict of interest. In our view, the time Vartain spent on settlement\nefforts on behalf of USF is not evidence that Community Initiatives engaged\nin unreasonable delay. The record contains ample evidence that once Vartain\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fmade the decision to sue its former client, Community Initiatives acted\npromptly to address Vartain\u2019s conflict. Community Initiatives was served\nwith process in July 2022 and filed its motion to disqualify Vartain five\nmonths later.\n         Regarding prejudice, Mr. Vartain posits that no other attorney can\nadequately replace him in the pending indemnity action. He states, for\nexample, that he represents USF in most if not all litigation that is filed in\nSan Francisco, that he has \u201cthousands of attorney hours of experience\nworking on this lawsuit,\u201d and that his institutional knowledge of USF is \u201cnot\nreplaceable.\u201d This glowing review is corroborated by USF\u2019s general counsel,\nbut it is not evidence of prejudice attributable to Community Initiatives.\nDespite Vartain\u2019s close relationship with USF, they elected to represent\nCommunity Initiatives in a prior, substantially related matter. Promptly\nafter Vartain\u2019s decision to sue Community Initiatives on behalf of USF in the\npending action, Community Initiatives asserted the conflict and filed a\ndisqualification motion. Thus, it neither consented to nor waived its right to\nobject to Vartain\u2019s current conflict of interest.\n                                                DISPOSITION\n          The order is affirmed.

The\nsuperior court issued a series of ex parte 20-day protective orders followed by a long-\nterm protective order.\n\f             The man appealed the long-term protective order, arguing in part that the\nsuperior court lacked the personal or subject matter jurisdiction necessary to grant such\nan order against someone who had never set foot in the state. Although we reject the\nman\u2019s argument about subject matter jurisdiction, we agree that the superior court\nlacked the personal jurisdiction necessary to justify an order imposing affirmative and\nlong-term obligations on an out-of-state respondent who has no contacts with Alaska.\nWe have already issued a summary order vacating the long-term protective order; this\nopinion explains our reasoning.\n      FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      A.     Facts\n             Jason Armstrong and Lacie Chance are the parents of a five-year-old\ndaughter. They never married, but at the time of the superior court proceedings they\nhad been in a relationship for eight years. They lived together in California until late\nApril 2022, when Chance left with their daughter and relocated to Wrangell.\n             The day after Chance arrived in Alaska, she filed a petition for a domestic\nviolence protective order (DVPO) against Armstrong in the superior court in Wrangell.\nThe petition sought both a 20-day protective order and a long-term protective order\n(typically of one-year duration). The petition alleged \u201cabout 7 years\u201d of domestic\nviolence, including physical and mental abuse of both Chance and her daughter. The\npetition requested temporary custody of the daughter, asked that Armstrong be awarded\nno visitation, and asked for no child support.\n      B.     Proceedings\n             The superior court issued a 20-day protective order on April 28, 2022,\nfinding probable cause to believe that Armstrong had committed or attempted to\ncommit assault or reckless endangerment. The order granted temporary custody of the\nparties\u2019 daughter to Chance and denied Armstrong any visitation rights because of a\nperceived risk to the safety of Chance and the child. The order set a hearing on Chance\u2019s\nrequest for a long-term protective order for May 17.\n\n                                           -2-                                     7681\n\f              Meanwhile, Armstrong pursued his own remedy in California.             The\nCalifornia superior court granted his ex parte application on May 13, issuing a\ntemporary emergency order for the return of the child to Armstrong\u2019s custody in\nCalifornia and setting a hearing for June 6.\n              The Alaska hearing began on May 17 and continued over four days.\nArmstrong appeared telephonically and by videoconference through his California\nattorney. Both parties presented witnesses. Armstrong maintained throughout the\nproceedings that the Alaska courts did not have jurisdiction over the matter because he\nhad never been to Alaska and all the alleged acts of domestic violence happened in\nCalifornia. The court overruled Armstrong\u2019s jurisdictional objections, finding it had\n\u201ctemporary jurisdiction at least [to] the extent for [the court] to hear the domestic\nviolence claims,\u201d and acknowledging that Armstrong had preserved the issue for\nappeal.\n              Armstrong appealed both the superior court\u2019s factual findings and its\nassertion of subject matter and personal jurisdiction. He asked that we vacate the\nsuperior court\u2019s judgment and reverse the long-term protective order. We concluded\nthat the Alaska court did not have personal jurisdiction over Armstrong, and we\ntherefore vacated the DVPO in a summary order with an explanation to follow.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              \u201cWe apply our independent judgment to questions of law, including\nstatutory interpretation.\u201d 1   \u201cWe review questions regarding both subject matter\njurisdiction and personal jurisdiction de novo, as \u2018[j]urisdictional issues are questions\n\n\n\n\n       1\n              Mitchell v.

We\nreject Armstrong\u2019s first argument but agree with his second.4\n       A.     The Superior Court Had Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Chance\u2019s\n              Domestic Violence Petition.\n              Subject matter jurisdiction is \u201cthe legal authority of a court to hear and\ndecide a particular type of case.\u201d5 In Alaska the superior court \u201cis the trial court of\ngeneral jurisdiction, with original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters.\u201d6 The\nstatute defining the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction states expressly that \u201ca petition for a\nprotective order under AS 18.66.100\u201318.66.180\u201d is \u201can action that falls within the\n\n\n\n\n       2\n             S.B. v.

Armstrong\ndisagrees with this interpretation of AS 25.30.330. Since our finding that the court had\nsubject matter jurisdiction is based on other grounds, we need not address these\narguments.\n       5\n           Hawkins v.

North Carolina,11 which he suggests stands for\nthe proposition that due process requires the petitioner to be domiciled in the state in\nwhich the petition is filed. Williams did not involve a domestic violence petition; in\nWilliams the Supreme Court held that North Carolina was constitutionally required to\ngive full faith and credit to a Nevada divorce when there was no dispute that the parties\nhad been domiciled in Nevada when divorced, as required by Nevada law.12 The Court\nexpressly avoided deciding whether the same full faith and credit should be accorded a\ndivorce granted to parties who were temporary residents of Nevada as opposed to\ndomiciled there; 13 the case thus has nothing to offer on the question of whether\ntemporary residence in a state is enough to allow the state\u2019s courts to adjudicate a\npetition for a domestic violence restraining order.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n               Shah v. Shah, 875 A.2d 931, 938 (N.J. 2005) (noting that while Georgia\nand Illinois \u201cstatutorily prohibit the filing of a domestic violence complaint against a\nnon-resident defendant when there has been no proof of any in-state domestic violence,\n. . . the overwhelming majority of states protect a victim of domestic violence while she\nis in the state, regardless of where the abuse occurred\u201d). The court in Shah identifies\nAlaska as one of the states whose statutes \u201care silent as to both venue and personal\njurisdiction in domestic violence matters\u201d and therefore \u201cdefault to their general venue\nprovisions.\u201d Id. at 938 n.4.\n      11\n             317 U.S. 287 (1942).\n      12\n             Id. at 302-03.\n      13\n             Id. at 302 (stating that because the Court \u201cmust assume that petitioners\nhad a bona fide domicil in Nevada,\u201d there was \u201cno question on the present record\nwhether a divorce decree granted by the courts of one state to a resident as distinguished\nfrom a domiciliary is entitled to full faith and credit in another state\u201d).\n\n                                           -6-                                      7681\n\f              Alaska\u2019s divorce statutes require that at least one spouse be a resident at\nthe time a divorce action is commenced in the state. 14 The DVPO statutes, on the other\nhand, make no mention of a residency requirement, and we see no other indication that\nthe legislature intended there to be one. Indeed, such a requirement would run afoul of\nwhat we now expressly recognize as Alaska\u2019s \u201clegitimate right to protect anyone within\nits borders from abuse regardless of the geographical source of the abuse.\u201d 15 We\ntherefore conclude that the superior court had the subject matter jurisdiction necessary\nto consider Chance\u2019s petition for a long-term DVPO.\n         B.   The Superior Court Did Not Have Personal Jurisdiction Over\n              Armstrong And Therefore Could Not Grant A Long-Term DVPO\n              Against Him.\n              Our holding that the superior court properly exercised subject matter\njurisdiction over Chance\u2019s DVPO petition requires us to answer a second question: Did\nthe court have the personal jurisdiction necessary to bind Armstrong? Our answer is\nthat it did not, given the prohibitions and obligations the order contained.\n              1.    The superior court lacked personal jurisdiction over\n                    Armstrong because he has no contacts with the state.\n              \u201cAlaska\u2019s long-arm statute, AS 09.05.015, lays out a list of circumstances\nunder which personal jurisdiction may be exercised.\u201d16 The list is not exclusive; the\n\n\n\n         14\n              AS 25.24.420 (\u201cOne of the parties to a complaint for legal separation must\nbe a resident of the state at the time the action is commenced.\u201d); see also AS 25.24.090\n(allowing out-of-state spouse to file for divorce in Alaska if defendant spouse is Alaska\nresident). \u201cResidency\u201d under Alaska law is conceptually similar to the domiciliary\nrequirement at issue in Williams. See Williams, 317 U.S. at 298 (observing that \u201cit\nseems clear that the provision of the Nevada statute that a plaintiff in this type of case\nmust \u2018reside\u2019 in the State for the required period requires him to have a domicil as\ndistinguished from a mere residence in the state\u201d).\n         15\n              Shah, 875 A.2d at 938.\n         16\n              See Alaska Telecomm., Inc. v.

General jurisdiction requires that the defendant be domiciled in the forum\nstate, 21 while specific jurisdiction requires that the defendant have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d\nwith the forum state.22 The minimum contacts analysis \u201cusually means that the party\n\n\n\n         17\n             AS 09.05.015(c) (\u201cThe jurisdictional grounds stated in (a)(2)-(10) of this\nsection are cumulative and in addition to any other grounds provided by the common\nlaw.\u201d).\n         18\n              Polar Supply Co., v.

He also argues that Alaska\ndoes not have specific jurisdiction either, as he has \u201cabsolutely no contacts\u201d with the\nstate.\n              The record in this case supports his assertion \u2014 since Armstrong has no\ncontacts with Alaska whatsoever, Alaska courts do not have personal jurisdiction over\nhim. But that is not the end of the inquiry, as there is a split among state courts with\nregard to what exactly due process requires in the context of DVPO litigation. Some\nstates require personal jurisdiction to the same extent as they would in any other civil\nmatter, while others waive the usual jurisdictional requirements for DVPOs as long as\nthe order imposes no affirmative duties on the respondent. We begin by analyzing the\norder at issue.\n\n\n\n\n         23\n             S.B. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Health & Soc.

The DVPO both prohibits certain conduct and imposes certain\n                     affirmative obligations. 25\n              The order at issue here, like all long-term DVPOs that follow the Alaska\nCourt System\u2019s standardized form,26 both prohibits certain conduct by the respondent\nand imposes on him certain affirmative obligations.            Armstrong is specifically\nprohibited from \u201cthreaten[ing] to commit or commit[ting] acts of domestic violence,\nstalking or harassment\u201d and \u201ctelephon[ing], contact[ing], or communicat[ing] in any\nway, directly or indirectly, with petitioner except . . . [b]y telephone or text message for\npurposes of facilitating child custody visitation as provided for in the California custody\n[order].\u201d Armstrong is prohibited from serving legal papers \u201cabout any other case\ninvolving the parties\u201d (emphasis in original) except \u201cthrough a process server while this\ndomestic violence order is in effect,\u201d unless the court first modifies the order at\nArmstrong\u2019s request. He is also prohibited from coming within 50 feet of Chance\u2019s\nresidence and from \u201center[ing], follow[ing], or interfer[ing] with the operation of any\nvehicle occupied by [Chance] or in [her] possession.\u201d\n              The order goes on to warn Armstrong of its various impacts and potential\nconsequences: \u201cYou can be arrested without a warrant for violating this order after you\nare served\u201d; \u201c[i]f you possess a firearm or ammunition while this order is in effect, you\nmay be charged with a federal offense even if [the order\u2019s express provisions] do not\nprohibit you from possessing these items\u201d; and \u201c[i]f you are convicted of assault in the\nfourth degree committed in violation of this order, you will be sentenced to at least 20\ndays in jail.\u201d The order also requires Armstrong (as well as Chance) to notify the court\n\n\n\n       25\n              As noted above, we previously vacated the long-term protective order by\nsummary order. For purposes of this opinion, however, we provide our explanation and\nanalysis as though the order were still in effect.\n       26\n              See Long-Term Domestic Violence Protective Order (One Petitioner),\nForm DV-105 (5/23), ALASKA COURT SYSTEM (on file with court). The standard form\nused in this matter was a previous version, Form DV-105 (1/21) (also on file with court).\n\n                                           -10-                                       7681\n\fin writing of \u201c[a]ny changes in address or telephone numbers\u201d and of \u201c[p]ending civil\ncourt actions and domestic violence criminal actions involving either the respondent or\nthe petitioner\u201d as long as the order remains in effect. And the order may last a long\ntime: Those aspects of the order that \u201cprohibit[] the respondent from committing or\nthreatening to commit acts of domestic violence, stalking or harassment, will remain in\neffect indefinitely, until dissolved by court order.\u201d\n                In sum, although the order is largely prohibitory, it also requires\nArmstrong to do certain things even though he may never appear in Alaska. For\nexample, he must limit his long-distance contacts with Chance to certain modes and\ncertain subjects, serve Chance only through a process server in any litigation between\nthem, advise the Alaska court of any changes of address or phone number, and advise\nthe Alaska court of any pending civil or \u201cdomestic violence criminal actions involving\neither\u201d party. And the order has serious consequences not only if Armstrong violates it\nbut even if he fully complies with it; most notably, as long as the order is in effect, he\nis prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms and ammunition.27\n                Recognizing the State\u2019s strong interest in protecting persons within its\nborders from abuse, we still must determine whether Alaska\u2019s courts may impose these\nprohibitions and obligations on a respondent over whom Alaska\u2019s courts lack personal\njurisdiction.\n                3.    Several states have allowed DVPOs even absent personal\n                      jurisdiction insofar as the orders are only prohibitory.\n                Some courts that allow DVPOs against absent defendants despite due\nprocess objections have reasoned that such an order can be characterized as a \u201cstatus\ndetermination\u201d for which personal jurisdiction is not necessary. In Bartsch v. Bartsch,\nfor example, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed a protective order granted against the\nplaintiff\u2019s out-of-state husband, relying in part on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\n\n\n       27\n                18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8).\n\n                                           -11-                                     7681\n\fWilliams that personal jurisdiction is not necessary in certain cases that simply\ndetermine the status of the in-state litigant rather than enter judgment against the absent\nlitigant. 28 The Bartsch court observed that a protective order was just such a \u201cstatus\ndetermination,\u201d as it \u201cmerely ordered the defendant to \u2018stay away from the protected\nparty\u2019 and not assault or communicate with her, in furtherance of the State\u2019s strong\ninterest in protecting Iowa residents from domestic abuse.\u201d29 Noting that many courts\nallow orders affecting marriage, custody, and parental rights even absent personal\njurisdiction over one party, the court explained:\n             The greater and more immediate risk of harm from domestic\n             violence, as opposed to the \u201cconsiderable interest in preventing\n             bigamous marriages and in protecting the offspring in marriages\n             from being [illegitimate]\u201d in dissolution proceedings, . . . makes\n             application of the status exception to protective orders even more\n             compelling than in dissolution actions. Indeed, the State\u2019s interest\n             in protecting victims of domestic abuse is equal to, if not greater\n             than, its interest in actions determining child custody or terminating\n             parental rights because it involves the safety of the protected\n             parties.[30]\n             The New Jersey Supreme Court followed a similar path in Shah v. Shah,\nholding that its trial courts could enter temporary orders prohibiting acts of domestic\nviolence even absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant so long as the orders did\n\n\n\n\n      28\n              Bartsch v. Bartsch, 636 N.W.2d 3, 6-10 (Iowa 2001); see also Shaffer v.\nHeitner, 433 U.S. 186, 208 n.30 (1977) (recognizing that certain jurisdictional rules\n\u201csuch as the particularized rules governing adjudication of status\u201d are not \u201cinconsistent\nwith the standard of fairness\u201d); S.B., 61 P.3d at 14 (observing that \u201c[t]he majority of\ncourts that have addressed the issue have held that child custody proceedings conducted\nunder the jurisdictional rules of the UCCJA fit within Shaffer\u2019s \u2018status\u2019 exception,\nmeaning that personal jurisdiction over non-consenting parties is not required\u201d).\n      29\n             636 N.W.2d at 10.\n      30\n            Id. at 9 (alteration in original) (quoting In re Kimura, 471 N.W.2d 869,\n875 (Iowa 1991)).\n\n                                           -12-                                       7681\n\fnot require any affirmative acts of the defendant. 31 The court reasoned that such a\nprohibitory order was \u201caddressed not to the defendant but to the victim: it provides the\nvictim the very protection the law specifically allows, and it prohibits the defendant\nfrom engaging in behavior already specifically outlawed.\u201d32\n              We largely agree with the rationale of these cases: A domestic violence\nprotective order issued without personal jurisdiction over the absent respondent, but\nwhich does nothing but grant the petitioner a protected status within Alaska\u2019s borders,\ndoes not violate the absent respondent\u2019s right to due process.\n              4.     We join the several states that require personal jurisdiction\n                     over the defendant for a long-term, non-emergency DVPO to\n                     be granted.\n              The order at issue here establishes more than just Chance\u2019s status as a\nprotected person under Alaska law. As explained above, it also imposes significant and\npotentially long-lasting restrictions and obligations on Armstrong: it restricts his right\n\n\n       31\n              875 A.2d 931, 940 n.5, 942 (N.J. 2005).\n       32\n              Id. at 939. The court in Shah also noted the existence of a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nprovision in the state\u2019s domestic violence statute, allowing the petitioner to file the\npetition \u201cin a court having jurisdiction over the place . . . where the plaintiff resides or\nis sheltered.\u201d Id. at 936 (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:25-28(a)); see also Spencer v.\nSpencer, 191 S.W.3d 14, 17, 19 (Ky.

Donovan, 879 N.E.2d\n117, 123, 125 (Mass. 2008) (explaining that protective order which \u201cprohibits the\ndefendant from abusing the plaintiff and orders him to have no contact with and to stay\naway from her . . . serves a role analogous to custody or marital determinations, except\nthat the order focuses on the plaintiff\u2019s protected status rather than [the plaintiff\u2019s]\nmarital or parental status\u201d); Hemenway v. Hemenway, 992 A.2d 575, 580-82 (N.H.\n2010) (affirming final protective order \u201cto the extent that it protects the wife from abuse,\nbut revers[ing] to the extent that the order requires affirmative action from the\ndefendant\u201d).\n\n                                           -13-                                       7681\n\fto communicate with Chance even by phone, text, and email from California; mandates\na method of service in \u201cany other case involving the parties\u201d; requires notice to the\nAlaska court of any changes of address or phone number and the pendency of other\ncivil or \u201cdomestic violence criminal\u201d litigation involving the parties; and restricts\nArmstrong\u2019s gun ownership.        Violation of any of these terms could carry harsh\nconsequences. We conclude that an order containing these terms violates due process\nif entered in the absence of personal jurisdiction over the respondent.\n              In Mannise v. Harrell, the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that a\ntrial court cannot enter a DVPO absent personal jurisdiction over the respondent\nbecause such an order \u201cinvolves both legal and non-legal collateral consequences[,]\u201d\nincluding impacts on custody proceedings and job prospects. 33 The order \u201cmay also\nplace restrictions on where a defendant may or may not be located, or what personal\nproperty a defendant may possess or use.\u201d 34 The order at issue in Mannise, for example,\n\u201cimplicate[d] substantial rights of Defendant, including visitation with and the care,\ncustody, and control of his minor son, or access to the schools he is attending.\u201d 35 The\nplaintiff was therefore required to prove that the North Carolina courts had personal\njurisdiction over the defendant. 36 \u201cTo hold otherwise would violate Due Process and\n\u2018offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d37\n              The North Carolina Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in Mucha\nv.

By\n             contrast, when a trial court enters a DVPO, the court creates\n             a \u201cstatus\u201d which did not previously exist and then invokes\n             that newly-created status to \u201cprohibit[ the defendant] from\n             engaging in behavior that would be entirely legal but for the\n             court\u2019s order.\u201d[40]\nThe Mucha court also cited Mannise, echoing the same concerns about the impacts to\nsubstantive rights of defendants and other collateral consequences, and noting further\nthat even a DVPO which appears on its face to be merely prohibitory may still impose\naffirmative obligations on a defendant.41 For example, compliance with the DVPO\nmight require the defendant to vacate a home or surrender possession of shared\nresidences or personal property to the plaintiff.42 The court concluded that these\n\u201cfairness concerns\u201d required a court to have personal jurisdiction over the defendant\nbefore issuing a DVPO. 43\n             We share these fairness concerns.

Even prohibitory\norders may come with long-distance consequences.45 For example, both federal law46\nand California law 47 prohibit persons subject to a DVPO from possessing firearms\nwhile the DVPO is in effect, and certain aspects of Alaska\u2019s standard DVPO \u201cremain\nin effect indefinitely, until dissolved by court order.\u201d And California, where custody of\nthe parties\u2019 daughter is being litigated, applies a rebuttable presumption against custody\nby a party found to have \u201cperpetrated domestic violence within the previous five years\nagainst the other party seeking custody of the child.\u201d48 The effect of the long-term\nDVPO against Armstrong could thus reach well beyond Alaska\u2019s borders even if we\ncould characterize it as merely prohibitory.\n              To be clear, this opinion does not curtail trial courts\u2019 ability to exercise\ntemporary jurisdiction on an emergency basis to issue ex parte protective orders where\n\u201cthe petition establishes probable cause that a crime involving domestic violence has\noccurred, it is necessary to protect the petitioner from domestic violence, and . . . the\npetitioner has certified to the court . . . the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide\n\n\n\n\n       44\n             See, e.g., Shah v.

It is unclear if or how this particular provision functions\nwhere, as here, the order was issued by an out-of-state court.

The\nsuperior court issued a series of ex parte 20-day protective orders followed by a long-\nterm protective order.\n\f             The man appealed the long-term protective order, arguing in part that the\nsuperior court lacked the personal or subject matter jurisdiction necessary to grant such\nan order against someone who had never set foot in the state. Although we reject the\nman\u2019s argument about subject matter jurisdiction, we agree that the superior court\nlacked the personal jurisdiction necessary to justify an order imposing affirmative and\nlong-term obligations on an out-of-state respondent who has no contacts with Alaska.\nWe have already issued a summary order vacating the long-term protective order; this\nopinion explains our reasoning.\n      FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      A.     Facts\n             Jason Armstrong and Lacie Chance are the parents of a five-year-old\ndaughter. They never married, but at the time of the superior court proceedings they\nhad been in a relationship for eight years. They lived together in California until late\nApril 2022, when Chance left with their daughter and relocated to Wrangell.\n             The day after Chance arrived in Alaska, she filed a petition for a domestic\nviolence protective order (DVPO) against Armstrong in the superior court in Wrangell.\nThe petition sought both a 20-day protective order and a long-term protective order\n(typically of one-year duration). The petition alleged \u201cabout 7 years\u201d of domestic\nviolence, including physical and mental abuse of both Chance and her daughter. The\npetition requested temporary custody of the daughter, asked that Armstrong be awarded\nno visitation, and asked for no child support.\n      B.     Proceedings\n             The superior court issued a 20-day protective order on April 28, 2022,\nfinding probable cause to believe that Armstrong had committed or attempted to\ncommit assault or reckless endangerment. The order granted temporary custody of the\nparties\u2019 daughter to Chance and denied Armstrong any visitation rights because of a\nperceived risk to the safety of Chance and the child. The order set a hearing on Chance\u2019s\nrequest for a long-term protective order for May 17.\n\n                                           -2-                                     7681\n\f              Meanwhile, Armstrong pursued his own remedy in California.             The\nCalifornia superior court granted his ex parte application on May 13, issuing a\ntemporary emergency order for the return of the child to Armstrong\u2019s custody in\nCalifornia and setting a hearing for June 6.\n              The Alaska hearing began on May 17 and continued over four days.\nArmstrong appeared telephonically and by videoconference through his California\nattorney. Both parties presented witnesses. Armstrong maintained throughout the\nproceedings that the Alaska courts did not have jurisdiction over the matter because he\nhad never been to Alaska and all the alleged acts of domestic violence happened in\nCalifornia. The court overruled Armstrong\u2019s jurisdictional objections, finding it had\n\u201ctemporary jurisdiction at least [to] the extent for [the court] to hear the domestic\nviolence claims,\u201d and acknowledging that Armstrong had preserved the issue for\nappeal.\n              Armstrong appealed both the superior court\u2019s factual findings and its\nassertion of subject matter and personal jurisdiction. He asked that we vacate the\nsuperior court\u2019s judgment and reverse the long-term protective order. We concluded\nthat the Alaska court did not have personal jurisdiction over Armstrong, and we\ntherefore vacated the DVPO in a summary order with an explanation to follow.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              \u201cWe apply our independent judgment to questions of law, including\nstatutory interpretation.\u201d 1   \u201cWe review questions regarding both subject matter\njurisdiction and personal jurisdiction de novo, as \u2018[j]urisdictional issues are questions\n\n\n\n\n       1\n              Mitchell v.

We\nreject Armstrong\u2019s first argument but agree with his second.4\n       A.     The Superior Court Had Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Chance\u2019s\n              Domestic Violence Petition.\n              Subject matter jurisdiction is \u201cthe legal authority of a court to hear and\ndecide a particular type of case.\u201d5 In Alaska the superior court \u201cis the trial court of\ngeneral jurisdiction, with original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters.\u201d6 The\nstatute defining the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction states expressly that \u201ca petition for a\nprotective order under AS 18.66.100\u201318.66.180\u201d is \u201can action that falls within the\n\n\n\n\n       2\n             S.B. v.

Armstrong\ndisagrees with this interpretation of AS 25.30.330.

North Carolina,11 which he suggests stands for\nthe proposition that due process requires the petitioner to be domiciled in the state in\nwhich the petition is filed. Williams did not involve a domestic violence petition; in\nWilliams the Supreme Court held that North Carolina was constitutionally required to\ngive full faith and credit to a Nevada divorce when there was no dispute that the parties\nhad been domiciled in Nevada when divorced, as required by Nevada law.12 The Court\nexpressly avoided deciding whether the same full faith and credit should be accorded a\ndivorce granted to parties who were temporary residents of Nevada as opposed to\ndomiciled there; 13 the case thus has nothing to offer on the question of whether\ntemporary residence in a state is enough to allow the state\u2019s courts to adjudicate a\npetition for a domestic violence restraining order.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n               Shah v.

The Superior Court Did Not Have Personal Jurisdiction Over\n              Armstrong And Therefore Could Not Grant A Long-Term DVPO\n              Against Him.\n              Our holding that the superior court properly exercised subject matter\njurisdiction over Chance\u2019s DVPO petition requires us to answer a second question: Did\nthe court have the personal jurisdiction necessary to bind Armstrong?

The DVPO both prohibits certain conduct and imposes certain\n                     affirmative obligations. 25\n              The order at issue here, like all long-term DVPOs that follow the Alaska\nCourt System\u2019s standardized form,26 both prohibits certain conduct by the respondent\nand imposes on him certain affirmative obligations.            Armstrong is specifically\nprohibited from \u201cthreaten[ing] to commit or commit[ting] acts of domestic violence,\nstalking or harassment\u201d and \u201ctelephon[ing], contact[ing], or communicat[ing] in any\nway, directly or indirectly, with petitioner except . . . [b]y telephone or text message for\npurposes of facilitating child custody visitation as provided for in the California custody\n[order].\u201d Armstrong is prohibited from serving legal papers \u201cabout any other case\ninvolving the parties\u201d (emphasis in original) except \u201cthrough a process server while this\ndomestic violence order is in effect,\u201d unless the court first modifies the order at\nArmstrong\u2019s request. He is also prohibited from coming within 50 feet of Chance\u2019s\nresidence and from \u201center[ing], follow[ing], or interfer[ing] with the operation of any\nvehicle occupied by [Chance] or in [her] possession.\u201d\n              The order goes on to warn Armstrong of its various impacts and potential\nconsequences: \u201cYou can be arrested without a warrant for violating this order after you\nare served\u201d; \u201c[i]f you possess a firearm or ammunition while this order is in effect, you\nmay be charged with a federal offense even if [the order\u2019s express provisions] do not\nprohibit you from possessing these items\u201d; and \u201c[i]f you are convicted of assault in the\nfourth degree committed in violation of this order, you will be sentenced to at least 20\ndays in jail.\u201d The order also requires Armstrong (as well as Chance) to notify the court\n\n\n\n       25\n              As noted above, we previously vacated the long-term protective order by\nsummary order. For purposes of this opinion, however, we provide our explanation and\nanalysis as though the order were still in effect.\n       26\n              See Long-Term Domestic Violence Protective Order (One Petitioner),\nForm DV-105 (5/23), ALASKA COURT SYSTEM (on file with court). The standard form\nused in this matter was a previous version, Form DV-105 (1/21) (also on file with court).\n\n                                           -10-                                       7681\n\fin writing of \u201c[a]ny changes in address or telephone numbers\u201d and of \u201c[p]ending civil\ncourt actions and domestic violence criminal actions involving either the respondent or\nthe petitioner\u201d as long as the order remains in effect. And the order may last a long\ntime: Those aspects of the order that \u201cprohibit[] the respondent from committing or\nthreatening to commit acts of domestic violence, stalking or harassment, will remain in\neffect indefinitely, until dissolved by court order.\u201d\n                In sum, although the order is largely prohibitory, it also requires\nArmstrong to do certain things even though he may never appear in Alaska. For\nexample, he must limit his long-distance contacts with Chance to certain modes and\ncertain subjects, serve Chance only through a process server in any litigation between\nthem, advise the Alaska court of any changes of address or phone number, and advise\nthe Alaska court of any pending civil or \u201cdomestic violence criminal actions involving\neither\u201d party. And the order has serious consequences not only if Armstrong violates it\nbut even if he fully complies with it; most notably, as long as the order is in effect, he\nis prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms and ammunition.27\n                Recognizing the State\u2019s strong interest in protecting persons within its\nborders from abuse, we still must determine whether Alaska\u2019s courts may impose these\nprohibitions and obligations on a respondent over whom Alaska\u2019s courts lack personal\njurisdiction.\n                3.    Several states have allowed DVPOs even absent personal\n                      jurisdiction insofar as the orders are only prohibitory.\n                Some courts that allow DVPOs against absent defendants despite due\nprocess objections have reasoned that such an order can be characterized as a \u201cstatus\ndetermination\u201d for which personal jurisdiction is not necessary. In Bartsch v. Bartsch,\nfor example, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed a protective order granted against the\nplaintiff\u2019s out-of-state husband, relying in part on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\n\n\n       27\n                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922</span><pre class=\"inline\">(g)(8).\n\n                                           -11-                                     7681\n\fWilliams that personal jurisdiction is not necessary in certain cases that simply\ndetermine the status of the in-state litigant rather than enter judgment against the absent\nlitigant. 28 The Bartsch court observed that a protective order was just such a \u201cstatus\ndetermination,\u201d as it \u201cmerely ordered the defendant to \u2018stay away from the protected\nparty\u2019 and not assault or communicate with her, in furtherance of the State\u2019s strong\ninterest in protecting Iowa residents from domestic abuse.\u201d29 Noting that many courts\nallow orders affecting marriage, custody, and parental rights even absent personal\njurisdiction over one party, the court explained:\n             The greater and more immediate risk of harm from domestic\n             violence, as opposed to the \u201cconsiderable interest in preventing\n             bigamous marriages and in protecting the offspring in marriages\n             from being [illegitimate]\u201d in dissolution proceedings, . . . makes\n             application of the status exception to protective orders even more\n             compelling than in dissolution actions. Indeed, the State\u2019s interest\n             in protecting victims of domestic abuse is equal to, if not greater\n             than, its interest in actions determining child custody or terminating\n             parental rights because it involves the safety of the protected\n             parties.[30]\n             The New Jersey Supreme Court followed a similar path in Shah v. Shah,\nholding that its trial courts could enter temporary orders prohibiting acts of domestic\nviolence even absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant so long as the orders did\n\n\n\n\n      28\n              Bartsch v.

Addington\n\n\n                                 EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER\n\n\n       Jeff Emerson worked as firefighter for the City of Cookeville, Tennessee for twenty-\nfour years. During his employment, he developed colorectal cancer and filed a claim for\nworkers\u2019 compensation benefits, which Cookeville eventually denied. The question is\nwhether Mr. Emerson\u2019s work was the primary cause of his cancer. The Court held a hearing\non January 9, 2024, and holds that Mr. Emerson is not likely to prove that his work was\nthe primary cause of his cancer.\n                                              Claim History\n\n       As part of his job with Cookeville, Mr. Emerson underwent yearly physicals by Dr.\nToney Hudson through its voluntary program. Unfortunately, in November 2021, a colon\ncancer screen detected cancerous cells, and Mr. Emerson notified Cookeville.\n\n      Dr. Hudson referred Mr. Emerson to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy, which\nfound cancer. The gastroenterologist referred Mr. Emerson to oncologist Dr. Algis Sidrys,\nwho ordered chemotherapy and radiation, and now Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer is in remission.1\n\n       After receiving notice, Cookeville offered Mr. Emerson a panel, and he chose Dr.\nHudson. Cookeville asked Dr. Hudson for a causation opinion on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer.\nDr. Hudson responded that another oncologist, Dr. Venumada Kotla, would be better suited\nto give an opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n    Mr. Emerson received this care through his personal health insurance.\n\n                                                      1\n\f       At Cookeville\u2019s request, Dr. Kotla saw Mr. Emerson and gave a causation\nstatement. He wrote: \u201cIn my best clinical judgment, it would not be possible to assign a\nnumerical risk of causation of 50% or more given the limitations of available epidemiologic\ndata.\u201d He assigned the causative effect of Mr. Emerson\u2019s work on his cancer at thirty\npercent. Cookeville denied Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim based on the assessment.\n\n       In response, Mr. Emerson asked Dr. Sidrys to address causation. Dr. Sidrys noted:\n\n       Given the lack of other risk factors for Mr. Emerson and given the clear proof\n       that firefighters are at an increased risk of GI cancers, specifically rectal\n       cancers, I do believe that Mr. Emerson\u2019s employment as a fireman has a\n       significant (greater than 51%) chance of having been a causative agent in his\n       malignancy.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        Mr. Emerson testified that he was exposed to toxins from structure, vehicle, and\nbrush fires. He gave approximate monthly numbers for each type of incident. He said that\nhe ate grilled red meat in moderation and drank from twelve to twenty beers a week. He\nquit smoking fourteen years ago but smoked a pack and a half daily before. He testified\nthat during his employment, he often got soot on his work uniform, was exposed to diesel\nexhaust fumes, and inhaled smoke from various types of fires. He said that he regularly\nexercised to stay in shape for his job. He requested medical and temporary benefits for his\ninjury.\n\n       Cookeville, through the affidavit of its human resource director, asserted that Dr.\nKotla was Mr. Emerson\u2019s authorized treating physician, and that it had properly denied his\nclaim after Dr. Kotla gave his opinion.\n\n      The parties also obtained expert medical opinions from two other physicians, Dr.\nDanny Whu (Mr. Emerson), and Dr. Sarkis Chobanian (Cookeville). Both doctors\nacknowledged that they do not know the cause of Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but gave their\nopinion based on risk factors to which they believed his work exposed him.\n\n       Dr. Whu is a retired firefighter and physician who serves as the Chief Medical\nOfficer of the International Association of Firefighters. He is an advocate for firefighters\nacross the nation. He prepared a report on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer and testified by\ndeposition.\n\n       In his report, he stated he reviewed literature on the subject, Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ntreatment records, and colorectal cancer generally. He found an absence of non-work-\nrelated risk factors and pointed out Mr. Emerson\u2019s job exposed him to multiple\ncarcinogens. He ended his report by saying \u201chis occupation as a fire fighter resulted in a\n\n                                             2\n\fnumerical risk value greater than 51% specific to his development of rectal cancer.\u201d He\nalso equated Mr. Emerson\u2019s exposure to \u201ceasily\u201d greater than 51% and then explained that\nTennessee law does not require a preponderance of evidence because the law provides a\npresumption that his cancer was caused by his work. He also stated that the benefit of the\ndoubt should be found in Mr. Emerson\u2019s favor.2\n\n       Dr. Whu further testified that in his job he advocates for firefighters to receive the\nbenefits they were due and testified before legislative bodies to help accomplish the unions\ngoals. He firmly stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary risk that caused his cancer\nand discounted other risk factors.\n\n       Dr. Chobanian is a board-certified gastroenterologist. He has performed over\n100,000 colonoscopies in his career. Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian a significant fee for\nhis time spent on the file and his trial testimony.\n\n        He testified in person that more likely Mr. Emerson\u2019s colorectal cancer was caused\nby the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which a colon lining cell mutates and becomes\nmore and more abnormal until it becomes cancerous. He excluded genetic causes because\npathologists found none during Mr. Emerson\u2019s treatment. He noted that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ncolon contained another non-cancerous polyp, which the surgeon removed, different from\nthe cancer in his lower colon \u0336 which shows the process had also started in the front of his\ncolon. He acknowledged Mr. Emerson\u2019s risk factor as a firefighter and determined that his\nfirefighting duties may have increased his risk of cancer but did not cause it. He also\ndiscussed Mr. Emerson\u2019s drinking and smoking and pointed out that they were significant\nrisk factors as well.\n\n                          Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n        Mr. Emerson must show that he would likely prevail at a hearing on the merits that\nhis cancer and need for treatment arose primarily out of and in the course and scope of his\nemployment. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-6-239(d)(1), 50-6-102(12) (2023). Specifically, he\nmust show \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [the work] contributed more\nthan fifty percent (50%) in causing the . . . disablement or need for medical treatment,\nconsidering all causes.\u201d \u201cShown to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d means that,\nin the opinion of the treating physician, it is more likely than not considering all causes as\nopposed to speculation or possibility. Id. at -102(12)(C)-(D).\n\n       For his part, Mr. Emerson testified credibly about his employment and exposure to\nvarious toxins in the smoke from fires, soot that collected on his gear, and diesel exhaust\nfumes from the firetruck engines in the firehouse garage. He testified about the\n\n2\n Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony about presumptions in the workers\u2019 compensation law is inaccurate. The Court relies\non his report solely as to his understanding of Tennessee workers\u2019 compensation law.\n\n                                                   3\n\fapproximate times he fought structure fires, vehicle fires, and vegetation fires. However,\nhe did not supply exact information of this nature for the experts to consider. He also\ntestified about his diet, weight, smoking, and alcohol intake.\n\n       For medical causation, both parties relied on experts to support their contentions.\nAll four experts were competent to testify about Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition. 3 However,\nneither Dr. Sidrys or Kotla fully explained how they reached their conclusions, based on\nthe information they received from Mr. Emerson and from medical studies.\n       Dr. Whu provided helpful insight about firefighting and exposure to toxins.\nHowever, he is an advocate for firefighters nationwide, and his testimony can be construed\nas biased in favor of Mr. Emerson by that very role. He also did not have a correct\nunderstanding of the Tennessee Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, nor is he qualified to testify\nas to what the law means. For these reasons, the Court gives little weight to his causation\nanalysis.\n       Although Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian well for his opinion, he was unbiased as\nto his causation analysis. He reviewed each risk factor and testified that some were\nmitigated, and others were more serious. He reasoned that it is impossible to say for sure\nwhat caused Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but most likely the major cause was the adenoma-\ncarcinoma sequence.\n        In summary of the experts\u2019 causation opinions, Dr. Sidrys stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\njob had a significant chance of being \u201ca\u201d causative agent of his cancer. (Emphasis added.)\nHe did not say that his job \u201cprimarily\u201d caused his cancer but only that it was a main risk,\nand the opinion contains an impermissible degree of speculation. Dr. Kotla assigned a\nthirty-percent risk to his job as causing Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but did not adequately\nexplain how arrived at this numeric value. It too seems speculative. Dr. Whu assigned over\nfifty-one percent, but as explained above his opinion carries little weight. In contrast, Dr.\nChobanian, whom the Court fully accredits, considered the risk factors and assigned them\nan appropriate weight. He found that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was not the primary risk factor of\nhis cancer.\n        Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job increased the\nrisk of him getting colorectal cancer, but the weight of the evidence does not establish that\nMr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary cause. The Court holds he is unlikely to prevail at a\n3\n Cookeville made two evidentiary objections to Mr. Emerson\u2019s medical experts. First, the City moved to\nexclude Dr. Sidrys\u2019s and Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony due to speculation. The Court overrules the motion, as both\ndoctors explained that they did not just speculate but evaluated the risk factors for Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition.\nSecond, Cookeville moved to exclude Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony based on a violation of Tennessee Rules of\nCivil Procedure 34.02 (2023) and his unauthorized investigation of fire stations. Neither Mr. Emerson nor\nhis attorney asked Dr. Whu to conduct these investigations. Dr. Whu did not obtain permission from\nCookeville\u2019s attorney to conduct the investigation. The Court grants the motion in part and excludes only\nhis testimony about and pictures of his investigation of the local fire stations.\n\n\n                                                      4\n\fhearing on the merits in proving that his cancer and the need for treatment arose primarily\nout of and in the course and scope of his employment.\n       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:\n       1. Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim against the City of Cookeville for the requested benefits is\n       denied at this time.\n\n       2. The Court sets a Status Hearing on March 19, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Central.

Addington\n\n\n                                 EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER\n\n\n       Jeff Emerson worked as firefighter for the City of Cookeville, Tennessee for twenty-\nfour years. During his employment, he developed colorectal cancer and filed a claim for\nworkers\u2019 compensation benefits, which Cookeville eventually denied. The question is\nwhether Mr. Emerson\u2019s work was the primary cause of his cancer. The Court held a hearing\non January 9, 2024, and holds that Mr. Emerson is not likely to prove that his work was\nthe primary cause of his cancer.\n                                              Claim History\n\n       As part of his job with Cookeville, Mr. Emerson underwent yearly physicals by Dr.\nToney Hudson through its voluntary program. Unfortunately, in November 2021, a colon\ncancer screen detected cancerous cells, and Mr. Emerson notified Cookeville.\n\n      Dr. Hudson referred Mr. Emerson to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy, which\nfound cancer. The gastroenterologist referred Mr. Emerson to oncologist Dr. Algis Sidrys,\nwho ordered chemotherapy and radiation, and now Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer is in remission.1\n\n       After receiving notice, Cookeville offered Mr. Emerson a panel, and he chose Dr.\nHudson. Cookeville asked Dr. Hudson for a causation opinion on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer.\nDr. Hudson responded that another oncologist, Dr. Venumada Kotla, would be better suited\nto give an opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n    Mr. Emerson received this care through his personal health insurance.\n\n                                                      1\n\f       At Cookeville\u2019s request, Dr. Kotla saw Mr. Emerson and gave a causation\nstatement. He wrote: \u201cIn my best clinical judgment, it would not be possible to assign a\nnumerical risk of causation of 50% or more given the limitations of available epidemiologic\ndata.\u201d He assigned the causative effect of Mr. Emerson\u2019s work on his cancer at thirty\npercent. Cookeville denied Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim based on the assessment.\n\n       In response, Mr. Emerson asked Dr. Sidrys to address causation. Dr. Sidrys noted:\n\n       Given the lack of other risk factors for Mr. Emerson and given the clear proof\n       that firefighters are at an increased risk of GI cancers, specifically rectal\n       cancers, I do believe that Mr. Emerson\u2019s employment as a fireman has a\n       significant (greater than 51%) chance of having been a causative agent in his\n       malignancy.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        Mr. Emerson testified that he was exposed to toxins from structure, vehicle, and\nbrush fires. He gave approximate monthly numbers for each type of incident. He said that\nhe ate grilled red meat in moderation and drank from twelve to twenty beers a week. He\nquit smoking fourteen years ago but smoked a pack and a half daily before. He testified\nthat during his employment, he often got soot on his work uniform, was exposed to diesel\nexhaust fumes, and inhaled smoke from various types of fires. He said that he regularly\nexercised to stay in shape for his job. He requested medical and temporary benefits for his\ninjury.\n\n       Cookeville, through the affidavit of its human resource director, asserted that Dr.\nKotla was Mr. Emerson\u2019s authorized treating physician, and that it had properly denied his\nclaim after Dr. Kotla gave his opinion.\n\n      The parties also obtained expert medical opinions from two other physicians, Dr.\nDanny Whu (Mr. Emerson), and Dr. Sarkis Chobanian (Cookeville). Both doctors\nacknowledged that they do not know the cause of Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but gave their\nopinion based on risk factors to which they believed his work exposed him.\n\n       Dr. Whu is a retired firefighter and physician who serves as the Chief Medical\nOfficer of the International Association of Firefighters. He is an advocate for firefighters\nacross the nation. He prepared a report on Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer and testified by\ndeposition.\n\n       In his report, he stated he reviewed literature on the subject, Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ntreatment records, and colorectal cancer generally. He found an absence of non-work-\nrelated risk factors and pointed out Mr. Emerson\u2019s job exposed him to multiple\ncarcinogens. He ended his report by saying \u201chis occupation as a fire fighter resulted in a\n\n                                             2\n\fnumerical risk value greater than 51% specific to his development of rectal cancer.\u201d He\nalso equated Mr. Emerson\u2019s exposure to \u201ceasily\u201d greater than 51% and then explained that\nTennessee law does not require a preponderance of evidence because the law provides a\npresumption that his cancer was caused by his work. He also stated that the benefit of the\ndoubt should be found in Mr. Emerson\u2019s favor.2\n\n       Dr. Whu further testified that in his job he advocates for firefighters to receive the\nbenefits they were due and testified before legislative bodies to help accomplish the unions\ngoals. He firmly stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary risk that caused his cancer\nand discounted other risk factors.\n\n       Dr. Chobanian is a board-certified gastroenterologist. He has performed over\n100,000 colonoscopies in his career. Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian a significant fee for\nhis time spent on the file and his trial testimony.\n\n        He testified in person that more likely Mr. Emerson\u2019s colorectal cancer was caused\nby the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which a colon lining cell mutates and becomes\nmore and more abnormal until it becomes cancerous. He excluded genetic causes because\npathologists found none during Mr. Emerson\u2019s treatment. He noted that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\ncolon contained another non-cancerous polyp, which the surgeon removed, different from\nthe cancer in his lower colon \u0336 which shows the process had also started in the front of his\ncolon. He acknowledged Mr. Emerson\u2019s risk factor as a firefighter and determined that his\nfirefighting duties may have increased his risk of cancer but did not cause it. He also\ndiscussed Mr. Emerson\u2019s drinking and smoking and pointed out that they were significant\nrisk factors as well.\n\n                          Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n        Mr. Emerson must show that he would likely prevail at a hearing on the merits that\nhis cancer and need for treatment arose primarily out of and in the course and scope of his\nemployment. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-6-239</span><pre class=\"inline\">(d)(1), 50-6-102(12) (2023). Specifically, he\nmust show \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [the work] contributed more\nthan fifty percent (50%) in causing the . . . disablement or need for medical treatment,\nconsidering all causes.\u201d \u201cShown to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d means that,\nin the opinion of the treating physician, it is more likely than not considering all causes as\nopposed to speculation or possibility. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at -102(12)(C)-(D).\n\n       For his part, Mr. Emerson testified credibly about his employment and exposure to\nvarious toxins in the smoke from fires, soot that collected on his gear, and diesel exhaust\nfumes from the firetruck engines in the firehouse garage. He testified about the\n\n2\n Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony about presumptions in the workers\u2019 compensation law is inaccurate. The Court relies\non his report solely as to his understanding of Tennessee workers\u2019 compensation law.\n\n                                                   3\n\fapproximate times he fought structure fires, vehicle fires, and vegetation fires. However,\nhe did not supply exact information of this nature for the experts to consider. He also\ntestified about his diet, weight, smoking, and alcohol intake.\n\n       For medical causation, both parties relied on experts to support their contentions.\nAll four experts were competent to testify about Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition. 3 However,\nneither Dr. Sidrys or Kotla fully explained how they reached their conclusions, based on\nthe information they received from Mr. Emerson and from medical studies.\n       Dr. Whu provided helpful insight about firefighting and exposure to toxins.\nHowever, he is an advocate for firefighters nationwide, and his testimony can be construed\nas biased in favor of Mr. Emerson by that very role. He also did not have a correct\nunderstanding of the Tennessee Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, nor is he qualified to testify\nas to what the law means. For these reasons, the Court gives little weight to his causation\nanalysis.\n       Although Cookeville paid Dr. Chobanian well for his opinion, he was unbiased as\nto his causation analysis. He reviewed each risk factor and testified that some were\nmitigated, and others were more serious. He reasoned that it is impossible to say for sure\nwhat caused Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but most likely the major cause was the adenoma-\ncarcinoma sequence.\n        In summary of the experts\u2019 causation opinions, Dr. Sidrys stated that Mr. Emerson\u2019s\njob had a significant chance of being \u201ca\u201d causative agent of his cancer. (Emphasis added.)\nHe did not say that his job \u201cprimarily\u201d caused his cancer but only that it was a main risk,\nand the opinion contains an impermissible degree of speculation. Dr. Kotla assigned a\nthirty-percent risk to his job as causing Mr. Emerson\u2019s cancer but did not adequately\nexplain how arrived at this numeric value. It too seems speculative. Dr. Whu assigned over\nfifty-one percent, but as explained above his opinion carries little weight. In contrast, Dr.\nChobanian, whom the Court fully accredits, considered the risk factors and assigned them\nan appropriate weight. He found that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job was not the primary risk factor of\nhis cancer.\n        Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Mr. Emerson\u2019s job increased the\nrisk of him getting colorectal cancer, but the weight of the evidence does not establish that\nMr. Emerson\u2019s job was the primary cause. The Court holds he is unlikely to prevail at a\n3\n Cookeville made two evidentiary objections to Mr. Emerson\u2019s medical experts. First, the City moved to\nexclude Dr. Sidrys\u2019s and Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony due to speculation. The Court overrules the motion, as both\ndoctors explained that they did not just speculate but evaluated the risk factors for Mr. Emerson\u2019s condition.\nSecond, Cookeville moved to exclude Dr. Whu\u2019s testimony based on a violation of Tennessee Rules of\nCivil Procedure 34.02 (2023) and his unauthorized investigation of fire stations. Neither Mr. Emerson nor\nhis attorney asked Dr. Whu to conduct these investigations. Dr. Whu did not obtain permission from\nCookeville\u2019s attorney to conduct the investigation. The Court grants the motion in part and excludes only\nhis testimony about and pictures of his investigation of the local fire stations.\n\n\n                                                      4\n\fhearing on the merits in proving that his cancer and the need for treatment arose primarily\nout of and in the course and scope of his employment.\n       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:\n       1. Mr. Emerson\u2019s claim against the City of Cookeville for the requested benefits is\n       denied at this time.\n\n       2. The Court sets a Status Hearing on March 19, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Central.

Ct. No. 15F03945)\n\n           v.\n\n ANTJUAN SYDNOR,\n\n                    Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n         In a prior opinion, we affirmed the murder conviction of defendant Antjuan\nSydnor but remanded for the trial court to consider its discretion to strike a firearm\nenhancement under then recently enacted Senate Bill No. 620 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.).\nOn remand, the trial court declined to strike the enhancement.\n         Defendant appeals, contending the trial court misinterpreted and misapplied Penal\nCode section 1385 and erred in not considering other interim sentencing changes under\nSenate Bill No. 567 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) and Assembly Bill No. 518 (2021-2022 Reg.\nSess.). (Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.)\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f       We conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in declining to strike\ndefendant\u2019s firearm enhancement but abused its discretion by failing to consider other\ninterim changes in the sentencing law. The sentence is vacated, and the matter remanded\nfor resentencing. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       Defendant and a codefendant entered the home of \u201cByron D., bound Byron and his\ngirlfriend, and forced them to the floor. [Defendant and the codefendant] then beat Byron\nwhile repeatedly asking him for money. Byron was shot in the head and killed when he\ndid not give them money.\u201d (People v. Sydnor (May 27, 2021, C085040, C085760)\n[nonpub. opn.] (Sydnor).) A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder with a\nrobbery special circumstance, robbery, and the enhancement of personally discharging a\nfirearm causing death for both counts (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)). The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to life without parole for the murder conviction plus 25 years to life for the\nfirearm enhancement. The court also sentenced defendant to the upper term of six years\nfor robbery but stayed that sentence, along with its firearm enhancement.\n       Defendant appealed, and we affirmed his convictions but remanded for the trial\ncourt to consider its discretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement. (Sydnor,\nsupra, C085040.)\n       In April 2022, the trial court held a hearing and noted this court \u201caffirmed the\nconviction but remanded to this Court solely to exercise the Court\u2019s discretion under the\nintervening legislation, [Senate Bill No.] 620, from 2017 that now gives the Court the\ndiscretion to strike the enhancement for personal discharge of a firearm causing\ndeath . . . . There is not a full resentencing.\u201d\n       At the hearing, the trial court pointed out to the People that \u201cone of the strongest\narguments\u201d by the defense was \u201cif there\u2019s already a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole, what does the additional 25-years-to-life add, other than it looks like\na sentence that would be imposed in Mississippi. For practical purposes, the Court has\n\n                                               2\n\fsentenced [defendant] to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d The People responded,\n\u201cthere is really no reason that the Court can cite to\u201d in section 1385 \u201cto allow something\nto be stricken in this case.\u201d The trial court then asked defense counsel if there were any\nmitigating circumstances, adding \u201cthis was a fairly cold-blooded killing. The victim was\nbound, tied in his own home[,] and then shot execution style. [Defendant] was on federal\nparole at the time.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cAll I can do is just submit the matter,\nyour Honor.\u201d\n       The trial court declined to exercise its discretion, explaining it had \u201ctwo reasons\nunder what I\u2019m calling the old traditional interest of justice analysis. Looking at the\ncircumstances of the crime, the fact that [defendant] was on federal parole at the time and\nconduct in prison, there are no mitigating circumstances that would argue it\u2019s in the\ninterest of justice to strike the enhancement. [\u00b6] Under a more specific analysis of the\nLegislature\u2019s amendment to [section] 1385[, subdivision ](c), I don\u2019t think this results in\na sentence that exceeds 20 years.

Because defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not request consideration of these\nsentencing changes in the trial court, the claims were forfeited. We nevertheless exercise\n\n                                              5\n\four discretion to reach the merits of these claims to eliminate the need to address\ndefendant\u2019s alternative ineffective assistance of counsel claim. (People v. Crittenden\n(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 146; In re Victor L. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 902, 928.) We agree\nwith defendant that remand is appropriate.\nA.     Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518\n       At the time of defendant\u2019s original sentencing, trial courts had discretion under\nsection 1170 to select the appropriate term if a statute prescribed a sentencing triad.\n(\u00a7 1170, former subd. (b).) Pursuant to Senate Bill No. 567, effective January 1, 2022,\nsection 1170, subdivision (b)(1) now provides that \u201cthe court shall, in its sound\ndiscretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (2).\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b)(1); Stats. 2021, ch. 731, \u00a7 1.3.)\nThe referenced exception provides a term exceeding the middle term may be imposed\n\u201conly when there are circumstances in aggravation of the crime that justify the imposition\nof a term of imprisonment exceeding the middle term[,] and the facts underlying those\ncircumstances have been stipulated to by the defendant or have been found true beyond a\nreasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial.\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd.\n(b)(2).)\n       Assembly Bill No. 518, also effective January 1, 2022, modified section 654 to\ngive trial courts discretion to choose the count on which they would stay execution of\nsentence. (\u00a7 654, subd. (a); Stats. 2021, ch. 441, \u00a7 1.) \u201cThus, under newly amended\nsection 654, a trial court is no longer required to punish under the longest possible term\nof imprisonment when multiple offenses are based on the same act or omission.\n[Citation.] Section 654 \u2018now provides the trial court with discretion to impose and\nexecute the sentence of either term, which could result in the trial court imposing and\nexecuting the shorter sentence rather than the longer sentence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nWhite (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1229, 1236.)\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Although our remittitur directed the trial court to consider whether to exercise its\ndiscretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement under Senate Bill No. 620, the trial\ncourt is not precluded from considering an intervening change of law after the issuance of\nthe remittitur that \u201cwas not, and could not have been, addressed in our remand order, and\nso it was not within the scope of the remittitur.\u201d (People v. Hargis (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th\n199, 207.) Thus, Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518, both of which became\neffective after we issued our opinion, were applicable at resentencing. But the trial court\nheld the resentencing hearing \u201csolely to exercise\u201d its discretion under Senate Bill\nNo. 620. This was an abuse of discretion. (In re White (2020) 9 Cal.5th 455, 470.)\n       When a trial court is unaware of the scope of its discretion, remand for\nresentencing is required \u201cunless the record \u2018clearly indicate[s]\u2019 that the trial court would\nhave reached the same conclusion \u2018even if it had been aware that it had such\ndiscretion.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1391.) Our record contains\nno such clear indication. Instead, the trial court expressed concerns over the length of\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. Remand is therefore appropriate for the trial court to exercise its\ndiscretion under Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518.\n       We reject the People\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was simply too\negregious for the trial court to even remotely entertain staying the most serious\nconviction of murder in favor of imposing such minimal punishment for robbery.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the applicable law governing the defendant\u2019s sentence has substantively changed\nafter sentencing, it is almost always speculative for a reviewing court to say what the\nsentencing court would have done if it had known the scope of its discretionary powers at\nthe time of sentencing. Mere reliance on the length of the original sentence and attendant\ndecisions, such as imposing consecutive sentences, imposing middle or upper term\nsentences, or declining to strike enhancements, is not sufficient to provide a clear\nindication of what a sentencing court might do on remand if it had been fully aware of the\nscope of its discretionary powers.\u201d (People v. Salazar (2023) 15 Cal.5th 416, 431.)\n\n                                              7\n\f       Having concluded remand is appropriate, we need not consider the People\u2019s\ncontention that the trial court properly relied on the aggravating factors in the probation\nreport in selecting the upper term on the robbery count.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded for the trial court to consider\nexercising its discretion under Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518. The trial\ncourt should also consider any additional, applicable changes to sentencing laws. The\njudgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                   /s/\n                                                  MESIWALA, J.\n\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n /s/\nMAURO, Acting P.

The sentence is vacated, and the matter remanded\nfor resentencing. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       Defendant and a codefendant entered the home of \u201cByron D., bound Byron and his\ngirlfriend, and forced them to the floor. [Defendant and the codefendant] then beat Byron\nwhile repeatedly asking him for money. Byron was shot in the head and killed when he\ndid not give them money.\u201d (People v. Sydnor (May 27, 2021, C085040, C085760)\n[nonpub. opn.] (Sydnor).) A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder with a\nrobbery special circumstance, robbery, and the enhancement of personally discharging a\nfirearm causing death for both counts (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)). The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to life without parole for the murder conviction plus 25 years to life for the\nfirearm enhancement. The court also sentenced defendant to the upper term of six years\nfor robbery but stayed that sentence, along with its firearm enhancement.\n       Defendant appealed, and we affirmed his convictions but remanded for the trial\ncourt to consider its discretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement. (Sydnor,\nsupra, C085040.)\n       In April 2022, the trial court held a hearing and noted this court \u201caffirmed the\nconviction but remanded to this Court solely to exercise the Court\u2019s discretion under the\nintervening legislation, [Senate Bill No.] 620, from 2017 that now gives the Court the\ndiscretion to strike the enhancement for personal discharge of a firearm causing\ndeath . . . . There is not a full resentencing.\u201d\n       At the hearing, the trial court pointed out to the People that \u201cone of the strongest\narguments\u201d by the defense was \u201cif there\u2019s already a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole, what does the additional 25-years-to-life add, other than it looks like\na sentence that would be imposed in Mississippi. For practical purposes, the Court has\n\n                                               2\n\fsentenced [defendant] to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d The People responded,\n\u201cthere is really no reason that the Court can cite to\u201d in section 1385 \u201cto allow something\nto be stricken in this case.\u201d The trial court then asked defense counsel if there were any\nmitigating circumstances, adding \u201cthis was a fairly cold-blooded killing. The victim was\nbound, tied in his own home[,] and then shot execution style. [Defendant] was on federal\nparole at the time.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cAll I can do is just submit the matter,\nyour Honor.\u201d\n       The trial court declined to exercise its discretion, explaining it had \u201ctwo reasons\nunder what I\u2019m calling the old traditional interest of justice analysis. Looking at the\ncircumstances of the crime, the fact that [defendant] was on federal parole at the time and\nconduct in prison, there are no mitigating circumstances that would argue it\u2019s in the\ninterest of justice to strike the enhancement. [\u00b6] Under a more specific analysis of the\nLegislature\u2019s amendment to [section] 1385[, subdivision ](c), I don\u2019t think this results in\na sentence that exceeds 20 years. Obviously it\u2019s life without, but I think the Legislature\nthere was talking about determinant sentencing; otherwise, the enhancement under\n12022.53[, subdivision ](d) could not be applied. But assuming for the sake of argument\nthat 20-year sentence is a mitigating factor, the Court would still find that dismissal could\nendanger public safety given the nature of the circumstances of this offense.

Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518\n       At the time of defendant\u2019s original sentencing, trial courts had discretion under\nsection 1170 to select the appropriate term if a statute prescribed a sentencing triad.\n(\u00a7 1170, former subd. (b).) Pursuant to Senate Bill No. 567, effective January 1, 2022,\nsection 1170, subdivision (b)(1) now provides that \u201cthe court shall, in its sound\ndiscretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (2).\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b)(1); Stats. 2021, ch. 731, \u00a7 1.3.)\nThe referenced exception provides a term exceeding the middle term may be imposed\n\u201conly when there are circumstances in aggravation of the crime that justify the imposition\nof a term of imprisonment exceeding the middle term[,] and the facts underlying those\ncircumstances have been stipulated to by the defendant or have been found true beyond a\nreasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial.\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd.\n(b)(2).)\n       Assembly Bill No. 518, also effective January 1, 2022, modified section 654 to\ngive trial courts discretion to choose the count on which they would stay execution of\nsentence. (\u00a7 654, subd. (a); Stats. 2021, ch. 441, \u00a7 1.) \u201cThus, under newly amended\nsection 654, a trial court is no longer required to punish under the longest possible term\nof imprisonment when multiple offenses are based on the same act or omission.\n[Citation.] Section 654 \u2018now provides the trial court with discretion to impose and\nexecute the sentence of either term, which could result in the trial court imposing and\nexecuting the shorter sentence rather than the longer sentence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nWhite (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">86 Cal.App.5th 1229</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1236.)\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Although our remittitur directed the trial court to consider whether to exercise its\ndiscretion to strike defendant\u2019s firearm enhancement under Senate Bill No. 620, the trial\ncourt is not precluded from considering an intervening change of law after the issuance of\nthe remittitur that \u201cwas not, and could not have been, addressed in our remand order, and\nso it was not within the scope of the remittitur.\u201d (People v. Hargis (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6107274\"><a href=\"/opinion/6240332/people-v-hargis/\">33 Cal.App.5th\n199</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207.) Thus, Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518, both of which became\neffective after we issued our opinion, were applicable at resentencing. But the trial court\nheld the resentencing hearing \u201csolely to exercise\u201d its discretion under Senate Bill\nNo. 620. This was an abuse of discretion. (In re White (2020) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">9 Cal.5th 455</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470.)\n       When a trial court is unaware of the scope of its discretion, remand for\nresentencing is required \u201cunless the record \u2018clearly indicate[s]\u2019 that the trial court would\nhave reached the same conclusion \u2018even if it had been aware that it had such\ndiscretion.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Gutierrez (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2672557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2672557/people-v-gutierrez/\">58 Cal.4th 1354</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1391.) Our record contains\nno such clear indication. Instead, the trial court expressed concerns over the length of\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. Remand is therefore appropriate for the trial court to exercise its\ndiscretion under Senate Bill No. 567 and Assembly Bill No. 518.\n       We reject the People\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was simply too\negregious for the trial court to even remotely entertain staying the most serious\nconviction of murder in favor of imposing such minimal punishment for robbery.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the applicable law governing the defendant\u2019s sentence has substantively changed\nafter sentencing, it is almost always speculative for a reviewing court to say what the\nsentencing court would have done if it had known the scope of its discretionary powers at\nthe time of sentencing. Mere reliance on the length of the original sentence and attendant\ndecisions, such as imposing consecutive sentences, imposing middle or upper term\nsentences, or declining to strike enhancements, is not sufficient to provide a clear\nindication of what a sentencing court might do on remand if it had been fully aware of the\nscope of its discretionary powers.\u201d (People v.

The arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief filed by\nThe Appellate Law Firm involve matters unrelated to the order appealed\nfrom, egregious mischaracterizations of the family court\u2019s rulings, reliance on\ntrial evidence not in the record, and assertions unsupported by any legal\nauthority. We dismiss the appeal as frivolous and impose sanctions of\n$9,421.50 against The Appellate Law Firm.1\n\n         1 At oral argument, Weinert personally appeared and asked to\n\nsubstitute in as his own counsel of record. The court indicated that it did not\nintend to issue sanctions against Weinert based upon a frivolous appeal or\ndelay tactics, but against the law firm that filed the brief. Counsel from The\nAppellate Law Firm, former appellate counsel to Weinert, was permitted to\nand did address the propriety of sanctions as to the law firm. Weinert was\npermitted to and did address the merits of the appeal.\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                         MEMORANDUM OPINION2\n      Schuster filed a petition for legal and physical custody of Minor in\nDecember 2021. Schuster then filed a request for a DVRO. The DVRO\nrequest alleged, among other things, that Weinert was harassing Schuster on\nthe shared parenting application they used to communicate about Minor.\nThe family court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) against\nWeinert for no contact with Schuster except \u201cbrief and peaceful contact\u201d to\ncommunicate about Minor for court-ordered visits.\n      A three-day trial was held on the DVRO request and child custody in\nAugust 2022. The family court made an oral pronouncement at the\nconclusion of the trial, finding Weinert\u2019s behavior rose to the level of domestic\nviolence under the Domestic Violence Protection Act (DVPA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7\n6200 et seq.) and citing \u201cthe texts . . . especially with regard to the fact that\nMr. Weinert continually. . . commented in negative ways to Ms. Schuster\ndespite the testimony that there were repeated attempts asking Mr. Weinert\nto stop doing that.\u201d The court also found that Schuster \u201cdid testify credibly\u201d\nthat Weinert had sent her documents in violation of the TRO, which was\n\u201cprima facie evidence of harassment and the disturbing of the peace.\u201d It\ncontinued: \u201cWith the ruling on the DVRO, the Court does order, based on the\ndiscussed behaviors, that the best interest of [Minor], then, would be for\ncustody to be provided to [Schuster]\u201d with visitation to Weinert. A DVRO\nwas entered on August 29, 2022. It attached a custody and visitation order\ngranting legal and physical custody of Minor to Schuster.\n\n\n\n\n      2 We resolve this case by memorandum opinion under California\n\nStandards of Judicial Administration, section 8.1.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      Weinert appealed. Schuster filed a motion for attorney fees and/or\nsanctions under California Rules of Court, rule 8.2763 against both Weinert\nand The Appellate Law Firm. The motion included a declaration from\nSchuster\u2019s counsel Edward Schrock that she had been billed $6,009.50 (at a\ndiscounted rate) for his preparation of the respondent\u2019s brief. It also included\na declaration from Schuster\u2019s other counsel, Richard Moller, that he had\nagreed to assist with the respondent\u2019s brief for $1,200. The motion requested\nattorney fees plus $412 in costs for filing the brief. We ordered that the\nmotion would be considered with the appeal and notified Weinert and The\nAppellate Law Firm that we were considering imposing sanctions. The\nAppellate Law Firm then filed an opposition to the motion, contending that\nthe arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief were not frivolous. The opposition did\nnot include any argument regarding the amount of fees or costs requested in\nthe motion.\n      \u201cCalifornia courts have the inherent power to dismiss frivolous appeals\u201d\nand \u201c \u2018[w]hen it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous\nor taken solely for delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as\nmay be just.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Gong & Kwong (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 510,\n516 (Gong); Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907.) Rule 8.276, subdivision (a)(1) provides\nthat we may impose sanctions on a party or attorney for \u201c[t]aking a frivolous\nappeal or appealing solely to cause delay.\u201d The first standard is objective: an\nappeal is objectively frivolous \u201cwhen a reasonable person would \u2018agree that\nthe appeal is completely devoid of merit.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Deal (2022) 80\nCal.App.5th 71, 79 (Deal).) The second standard is subjective, focused on the\nmotives and \u201cgood faith\u201d of appellant and counsel. (Gong, at p. 516.) \u201c \u2018While\n\n      3 Undesignated rule references are to the California Rules of Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\feach of the above standards provides independent authority for a sanctions\naward, in practice the two standards usually are used together \u201cwith one\nproviding evidence of the other. Thus, the total lack of merit of an appeal is\nviewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Ibid.) Sanctions \u201cshould be used sparingly to deter only the most egregious\nconduct,\u201d but they are imposed \u201c \u2018 \u201cto discourage further frivolous appeals,\nand to compensate for the loss that results from the delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (In re\nMarriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 651; Deal, at p. 79.)\n      All seven arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief show that the appeal here\nis objectively frivolous and intended to delay. First, the brief argues the\nfamily court \u201cabused its discretion in failing to enforce subpoenas,\u201d\nidentifying subpoenas purportedly issued to the parties\u2019 mediator Joseph\nHale, a car dealership, and a police officer. The record shows that at least\none of those subpoenas was unrelated to the trial on the DVRO: Weinert had\nfiled a subpoena for Hale to appear at an earlier proceeding on Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for an emergency temporary custody order. The brief offers nothing\nto show that the other two subpoenas were served, or that Weinert requested\nthe court take any action on these subpoenas (let alone that any failure to act\nwas an abuse of discretion).\n      Second, the brief argues that the family court erred in finding Weinert\nin contempt but fails to cite any such finding in the record. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(C) [matters must be supported by citation to record].) Schuster\nhad previously filed an order to show cause for contempt, but dismissed it\nbefore the trial on the DVRO. The brief appears to argue that the TRO (not\nthe DVRO) was \u201cpredicated\u201d on this contempt charge (the allegations, not any\nfinding by the court). Any information considered by the trial court prior to\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fissuance of the ex parte TRO is not before this court on appeal. Only the\nrestraining order after hearing dated August 29, 2022, was appealed.\n      Third, appellant\u2019s brief argues there was no substantial evidence to\nsupport a determination limiting Weinert\u2019s ability to manage Minor\u2019s medical\ncare. The brief does not address Family Code section 3044\u2019s rebuttable\npresumption that joint legal and physical custody is not in the best interests\nof a child following the decision to grant a request for a domestic violence\nrestraining order. Instead, the brief argues that the evidence did not support\na finding that Weinert \u201cmade [Minor\u2019s] doctor\u2019s appointments during\n[Schuster\u2019s] parenting time,\u201d and thus he should not have been deprived of\nparental rights over Minor\u2019s medical care. As a preliminary matter, the brief\nfails to cite the record showing the court relied on this evidence to find that\nproviding legal custody (including decisions on health care) to Schuster was\nin the Minor\u2019s best interests. Even if it did, the brief disputes this evidence\nby pointing to testimony from Minor\u2019s doctor that is not in the record. We\ncannot analyze a substantial evidence argument without an adequate record,\nincluding portions of the record that appellant has argued are relevant. (See,\ne.g., Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 181, 189\n[\u201cWithout a proper record, there is no way for this court to find that the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence\u201d].)4 The brief\nalso refers to documents Weinert presented on his earlier request for an\n\n\n\n      4 At oral argument, Weinert suggested the trial court failed to provide\n\nthe complete trial record and that this omission was intentional. Weinert\nbore the burden of ensuring an adequate record for review on appeal or\npursuing appropriate remedies if he believed the record was not provided in\nerror. (See, e.g., World Business Academy v. State Lands Commission (2018)\n24 Cal.App.5th 476, 492\u2013493.)\n\n\n                                        5\n\femergency temporary custody order, without any citation that this was\nevidence admitted in the DVRO trial.\n      Fourth, the brief argues there was no substantial evidence to support\nthe DVRO because Schuster \u201cmanipulated text messages that were presented\nto the trial court,\u201d but the trial exhibits\u2014including the voluminous text or\nFamily Wizard messages\u2014are not included in the record. Again, we cannot\nreach the merits of an argument without an adequate record of the evidence.\n(Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc., supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 186.)\n      Fifth, the brief argues Schuster made \u201cunfounded allegations of\nphysical incidents\u201d that did not support her earlier request for an emergency\ntemporary custody order. This is not an argument related to the DVRO, as\nthe brief appears to concede that Schuster did not raise these \u201cincidents\u201d\nafter previously alleging them.\n      Sixth, the brief argues that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion in\ndenying [Weinert\u2019s] request for a continuance in order to have a witness\ntestify.\u201d This is a gross mischaracterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nWeinert had an allotment of time to present evidence at the DVRO trial.\nTowards the end of that time, Weinert stated: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that I will\nhave enough time for [witness] to come down based upon being an hour. Is\nthere a possibility, your Honor, that I\u2019m able to get any more time?\u201d The\ncourt responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Appellant has provided no authority for any\nargument that the trial court abused its discretion in declining Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for additional time. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) [matters should be\nsupported by citation to legal authority where possible].)\n      Seventh, the brief includes an improper catch-all section that the\nfamily court made \u201cadditional blatant mistakes\u201d warranting reversal. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(B) [brief must state each point under a separate heading or\n\n                                        6\n\fsubheading summarizing the point].) It contends that Weinert was \u201cforced to\ntake pictures\u201d of trial evidence, because the family court \u201cwarned him that he\nwould not be allowed to see those records again.\u201d There is no citation to the\nrecord to support this assertion, but appears to be related to the parties\u2019\nstipulation to the return of the trial exhibits.\n      The brief then argues that the family court erred because it \u201conly\nallow[ed] the viewing of the videos [presented at trial by Weinert] silently,\nsignificantly weakening their impact and probative value.\u201d Weinert does not\ncite to any evidence in the trial record to support this argument. Indeed, the\nreporter\u2019s transcript shows that Weinert\u2019s videos were played but audio was\nnot reported.\n      Despite arguing that police call logs were improperly excluded from\ntrial\u2014citing only to a sustained objection that Weinert had to lay foundation\nbefore questioning Schuster about the logs\u2014the brief goes on to argue that\nany \u201cdocuments or reports\u201d from police or the mediator were \u201cimproperly\nadmitted.\u201d As there is no specific evidence identified, nor any citation to the\nrecord, we are unable to address the argument. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(C).)\n      In sum, all of the arguments presented in the appellant\u2019s brief involve\nmatters unrelated to the DVRO, egregious mischaracterizations of the court\u2019s\nrulings, arguments concerning documents in the court file not presented at\ntrial, arguments concerning trial evidence not in the appellate record, and\nassertions unsupported by any legal authority. Any reasonable attorney\nwould agree that the arguments as presented are completely without merit.5\n\n\n\n      5 At oral argument, Weinert raised additional arguments that were not\n\ncontained in the appellant\u2019s brief. These arguments are forfeited. (Palp, Inc.\nv. Williamsburg National Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 282, 291, fn. 2\n\n                                         7\n\f(Deal, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at p. 79.) The appeal is thus frivolous and\nwarrants sanctions. (Gong, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 516.) The tone of\nthe brief further supports this conclusion. \u201c[A]n unsupported appellate tirade\nis more than just words on paper; it represents a real cost to the opposing\nparty and to the state.\u201d (Pierotti v. Torian (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 32\u201333.)\n      At oral argument, the court clarified that sanctions would not be\nimposed against Weinert, but solely against the law firm that filed the\nchallenged brief. (See Rule 8.276 [appellate court may impose sanctions\nagainst party or attorney]; Malek Media Group, LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020)\n58 Cal.App.5th 817, 837 [same] (Malek); see also Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7128.5,\nsubd. (f)(1)(C) [\u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held\njointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and\nemployees\u201d].) \u201cSanctions are appropriate when appellant\u2019s counsel had a\nprofessional obligation not to pursue the appeal or should have declined the\ncase outright.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cSanctions against the party are appropriate when the\nrecord indicates the party benefitted from the delay or was otherwise\ninvolved in the bad faith conduct.\u201d (Ibid.)\n      We conclude that sanctions are appropriate against The Appellate Law\nFirm only. As explained above, the arguments in the firm\u2019s brief violate the\nRules of Court and are not supported by even a cursory reading of the record\npresented, let alone a \u201c \u2018careful reading of the record or the law.\u2019 \u201d (J.B.B.\nInvestment Partners Ltd. v. Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1, 17.) There is no\nevidence, however, that Weinert directly participated in this appeal: the\nnotice of appeal and appellant\u2019s brief were both filed by The Appellate Law\n\n\n[\u201c \u2018We do not consider arguments that are raised for the first time at oral\nargument\u2019 \u201d].)\n\n\n                                        8\n\fFirm.

The arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief filed by\nThe Appellate Law Firm involve matters unrelated to the order appealed\nfrom, egregious mischaracterizations of the family court\u2019s rulings, reliance on\ntrial evidence not in the record, and assertions unsupported by any legal\nauthority. We dismiss the appeal as frivolous and impose sanctions of\n$9,421.50 against The Appellate Law Firm.1\n\n         1 At oral argument, Weinert personally appeared and asked to\n\nsubstitute in as his own counsel of record. The court indicated that it did not\nintend to issue sanctions against Weinert based upon a frivolous appeal or\ndelay tactics, but against the law firm that filed the brief. Counsel from The\nAppellate Law Firm, former appellate counsel to Weinert, was permitted to\nand did address the propriety of sanctions as to the law firm. Weinert was\npermitted to and did address the merits of the appeal.\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                         MEMORANDUM OPINION2\n      Schuster filed a petition for legal and physical custody of Minor in\nDecember 2021. Schuster then filed a request for a DVRO. The DVRO\nrequest alleged, among other things, that Weinert was harassing Schuster on\nthe shared parenting application they used to communicate about Minor.\nThe family court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) against\nWeinert for no contact with Schuster except \u201cbrief and peaceful contact\u201d to\ncommunicate about Minor for court-ordered visits.\n      A three-day trial was held on the DVRO request and child custody in\nAugust 2022. The family court made an oral pronouncement at the\nconclusion of the trial, finding Weinert\u2019s behavior rose to the level of domestic\nviolence under the Domestic Violence Protection Act (DVPA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7\n6200 et seq.) and citing \u201cthe texts . . . especially with regard to the fact that\nMr. Weinert continually. . . commented in negative ways to Ms. Schuster\ndespite the testimony that there were repeated attempts asking Mr. Weinert\nto stop doing that.\u201d The court also found that Schuster \u201cdid testify credibly\u201d\nthat Weinert had sent her documents in violation of the TRO, which was\n\u201cprima facie evidence of harassment and the disturbing of the peace.\u201d It\ncontinued: \u201cWith the ruling on the DVRO, the Court does order, based on the\ndiscussed behaviors, that the best interest of [Minor], then, would be for\ncustody to be provided to [Schuster]\u201d with visitation to Weinert. A DVRO\nwas entered on August 29, 2022. It attached a custody and visitation order\ngranting legal and physical custody of Minor to Schuster.\n\n\n\n\n      2 We resolve this case by memorandum opinion under California\n\nStandards of Judicial Administration, section 8.1.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      Weinert appealed. Schuster filed a motion for attorney fees and/or\nsanctions under California Rules of Court, rule 8.2763 against both Weinert\nand The Appellate Law Firm. The motion included a declaration from\nSchuster\u2019s counsel Edward Schrock that she had been billed $6,009.50 (at a\ndiscounted rate) for his preparation of the respondent\u2019s brief. It also included\na declaration from Schuster\u2019s other counsel, Richard Moller, that he had\nagreed to assist with the respondent\u2019s brief for $1,200. The motion requested\nattorney fees plus $412 in costs for filing the brief. We ordered that the\nmotion would be considered with the appeal and notified Weinert and The\nAppellate Law Firm that we were considering imposing sanctions. The\nAppellate Law Firm then filed an opposition to the motion, contending that\nthe arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief were not frivolous. The opposition did\nnot include any argument regarding the amount of fees or costs requested in\nthe motion.\n      \u201cCalifornia courts have the inherent power to dismiss frivolous appeals\u201d\nand \u201c \u2018[w]hen it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous\nor taken solely for delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as\nmay be just.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Gong &amp; Kwong (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265852\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265852/in-re-marriage-of-gong-kwong/\">163 Cal.App.4th 510</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n516 (Gong); Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907.) Rule 8.276, subdivision (a)(1) provides\nthat we may impose sanctions on a party or attorney for \u201c[t]aking a frivolous\nappeal or appealing solely to cause delay.\u201d The first standard is objective: an\nappeal is objectively frivolous \u201cwhen a reasonable person would \u2018agree that\nthe appeal is completely devoid of merit.\u2019 \u201d (In re Marriage of Deal (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">80\nCal.App.5th 71</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (Deal).) The second standard is subjective, focused on the\nmotives and \u201cgood faith\u201d of appellant and counsel. (Gong, at p. 516.) \u201c \u2018While\n\n      3 Undesignated rule references are to the California Rules of Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\feach of the above standards provides independent authority for a sanctions\naward, in practice the two standards usually are used together \u201cwith one\nproviding evidence of the other. Thus, the total lack of merit of an appeal is\nviewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Ibid.) Sanctions \u201cshould be used sparingly to deter only the most egregious\nconduct,\u201d but they are imposed \u201c \u2018 \u201cto discourage further frivolous appeals,\nand to compensate for the loss that results from the delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (In re\nMarriage of Flaherty (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">31 Cal.3d 637</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651; Deal, at p. 79.)\n      All seven arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief show that the appeal here\nis objectively frivolous and intended to delay. First, the brief argues the\nfamily court \u201cabused its discretion in failing to enforce subpoenas,\u201d\nidentifying subpoenas purportedly issued to the parties\u2019 mediator Joseph\nHale, a car dealership, and a police officer. The record shows that at least\none of those subpoenas was unrelated to the trial on the DVRO: Weinert had\nfiled a subpoena for Hale to appear at an earlier proceeding on Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for an emergency temporary custody order. The brief offers nothing\nto show that the other two subpoenas were served, or that Weinert requested\nthe court take any action on these subpoenas (let alone that any failure to act\nwas an abuse of discretion).\n      Second, the brief argues that the family court erred in finding Weinert\nin contempt but fails to cite any such finding in the record. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(C) [matters must be supported by citation to record].) Schuster\nhad previously filed an order to show cause for contempt, but dismissed it\nbefore the trial on the DVRO. The brief appears to argue that the TRO (not\nthe DVRO) was \u201cpredicated\u201d on this contempt charge (the allegations, not any\nfinding by the court). Any information considered by the trial court prior to\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\fissuance of the ex parte TRO is not before this court on appeal. Only the\nrestraining order after hearing dated August 29, 2022, was appealed.\n      Third, appellant\u2019s brief argues there was no substantial evidence to\nsupport a determination limiting Weinert\u2019s ability to manage Minor\u2019s medical\ncare. The brief does not address Family Code section 3044\u2019s rebuttable\npresumption that joint legal and physical custody is not in the best interests\nof a child following the decision to grant a request for a domestic violence\nrestraining order. Instead, the brief argues that the evidence did not support\na finding that Weinert \u201cmade [Minor\u2019s] doctor\u2019s appointments during\n[Schuster\u2019s] parenting time,\u201d and thus he should not have been deprived of\nparental rights over Minor\u2019s medical care. As a preliminary matter, the brief\nfails to cite the record showing the court relied on this evidence to find that\nproviding legal custody (including decisions on health care) to Schuster was\nin the Minor\u2019s best interests. Even if it did, the brief disputes this evidence\nby pointing to testimony from Minor\u2019s doctor that is not in the record. We\ncannot analyze a substantial evidence argument without an adequate record,\nincluding portions of the record that appellant has argued are relevant. (See,\ne.g., Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5665923\"><a href=\"/opinion/5810482/foust-v-san-jose-construction-co/\">198 Cal.App.4th 181</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189\n[\u201cWithout a proper record, there is no way for this court to find that the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence\u201d].)4 The brief\nalso refers to documents Weinert presented on his earlier request for an\n\n\n\n      4 At oral argument, Weinert suggested the trial court failed to provide\n\nthe complete trial record and that this omission was intentional. Weinert\nbore the burden of ensuring an adequate record for review on appeal or\npursuing appropriate remedies if he believed the record was not provided in\nerror. (See, e.g., World Business Academy v. State Lands Commission (2018)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6106628\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239704/world-bus-acad-v-cal-state-lands-commn/\">24 Cal.App.5th 476</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492\u2013493.)\n\n\n                                        5\n\femergency temporary custody order, without any citation that this was\nevidence admitted in the DVRO trial.\n      Fourth, the brief argues there was no substantial evidence to support\nthe DVRO because Schuster \u201cmanipulated text messages that were presented\nto the trial court,\u201d but the trial exhibits\u2014including the voluminous text or\nFamily Wizard messages\u2014are not included in the record. Again, we cannot\nreach the merits of an argument without an adequate record of the evidence.\n(Foust v. San Jose Construction Co., Inc., supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 186.)\n      Fifth, the brief argues Schuster made \u201cunfounded allegations of\nphysical incidents\u201d that did not support her earlier request for an emergency\ntemporary custody order. This is not an argument related to the DVRO, as\nthe brief appears to concede that Schuster did not raise these \u201cincidents\u201d\nafter previously alleging them.\n      Sixth, the brief argues that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion in\ndenying [Weinert\u2019s] request for a continuance in order to have a witness\ntestify.\u201d This is a gross mischaracterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nWeinert had an allotment of time to present evidence at the DVRO trial.\nTowards the end of that time, Weinert stated: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that I will\nhave enough time for [witness] to come down based upon being an hour. Is\nthere a possibility, your Honor, that I\u2019m able to get any more time?\u201d The\ncourt responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Appellant has provided no authority for any\nargument that the trial court abused its discretion in declining Weinert\u2019s\nrequest for additional time. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(B) [matters should be\nsupported by citation to legal authority where possible].)\n      Seventh, the brief includes an improper catch-all section that the\nfamily court made \u201cadditional blatant mistakes\u201d warranting reversal. (Rule\n8.204(a)(1)(B) [brief must state each point under a separate heading or\n\n                                        6\n\fsubheading summarizing the point].) It contends that Weinert was \u201cforced to\ntake pictures\u201d of trial evidence, because the family court \u201cwarned him that he\nwould not be allowed to see those records again.\u201d There is no citation to the\nrecord to support this assertion, but appears to be related to the parties\u2019\nstipulation to the return of the trial exhibits.\n      The brief then argues that the family court erred because it \u201conly\nallow[ed] the viewing of the videos [presented at trial by Weinert] silently,\nsignificantly weakening their impact and probative value.\u201d Weinert does not\ncite to any evidence in the trial record to support this argument. Indeed, the\nreporter\u2019s transcript shows that Weinert\u2019s videos were played but audio was\nnot reported.\n      Despite arguing that police call logs were improperly excluded from\ntrial\u2014citing only to a sustained objection that Weinert had to lay foundation\nbefore questioning Schuster about the logs\u2014the brief goes on to argue that\nany \u201cdocuments or reports\u201d from police or the mediator were \u201cimproperly\nadmitted.\u201d As there is no specific evidence identified, nor any citation to the\nrecord, we are unable to address the argument. (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(C).)\n      In sum, all of the arguments presented in the appellant\u2019s brief involve\nmatters unrelated to the DVRO, egregious mischaracterizations of the court\u2019s\nrulings, arguments concerning documents in the court file not presented at\ntrial, arguments concerning trial evidence not in the appellate record, and\nassertions unsupported by any legal authority. Any reasonable attorney\nwould agree that the arguments as presented are completely without merit.5\n\n\n\n      5 At oral argument, Weinert raised additional arguments that were not\n\ncontained in the appellant\u2019s brief. These arguments are forfeited. (Palp, Inc.\nv. Williamsburg National Ins. Co. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5666092\"><a href=\"/opinion/5810644/palp-inc-v-williamsburg-national-insurance/\">200 Cal.App.4th 282</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291, fn. 2\n\n                                         7\n\f(Deal, supra, 80 Cal.App.5th at p. 79.) The appeal is thus frivolous and\nwarrants sanctions.

The tone of\nthe brief further supports this conclusion. \u201c[A]n unsupported appellate tirade\nis more than just words on paper; it represents a real cost to the opposing\nparty and to the state.\u201d (Pierotti v.

As explained above, the arguments in the firm\u2019s brief violate the\nRules of Court and are not supported by even a cursory reading of the record\npresented, let alone a \u201c \u2018careful reading of the record or the law.\u2019 \u201d (J.B.B.\nInvestment Partners Ltd. v.
