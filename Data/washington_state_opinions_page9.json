Bennett (Mother) in contempt for failing to follow\nthe terms of its Order Modifying Decree of Divorce and entered judgment against her. She\nappeals, and we affirm.\n\n                                                    ISSUE\n\n[\u00b62]    Mother presented two issues on appeal, which we consolidate as one:\n\n                 1. Did the district court err when it found Mother in contempt?\n\n                                                    FACTS\n\n[\u00b63] Matthew J. (Father) and Rachel E. (Mother) Bennett divorced in 2013. The 2018\nStipulated Order Modifying Stipulated Decree of Divorce (Decree) awarded Father\nprimary physical custody of their two minor children, and the parties were to share joint\nlegal custody. The Decree contained other provisions relevant to this appeal. First, the\nparents were required to split the payments evenly for any uninsured medical expenses.\nSecond, the parents were to follow all medical directives pertaining to the children. Third,\nthe parents were to seek each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\ndecision regarding the children\u2019s health, education, or welfare.\n\n[\u00b64] In 2022, Father filed a motion for order to show cause, asking the district court to\norder Mother to appear and show cause why the court should not hold her in contempt for\nfailing to comply with the three Decree provisions listed above, among others. 1 At the order\nto show cause hearing, the district court issued an oral ruling finding Mother in contempt,\nwhich was followed by a written order. The district court entered judgment for the unpaid\nmedical bills of $4,652.07 and awarded Father attorney fees. Mother appeals the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment and order finding her in contempt for failing to pay her share of uninsured\nmedical bills; to follow medical directives; and to seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before\nreengaging the children in counseling. 2\n\n\n\n1\n  Father also claimed Mother: (1) failed to nurture love and respect for him; (2) disparaged him to the\nchildren; (3) failed to train the children to obey and respect their teachers and the law; (4) failed to personally\nsupervise one of the children; (5) engaged in obscenities in front of the children; (6) intruded upon his\nprivacy and falsely made or implied mean statements about him; and (7) vilified him, all in violation of the\nDecree.\n2\n  The district court also found Mother in contempt of the Decree\u2019s civility provisions because she sent\nFather inappropriate text messages, she accused Father of poaching in front of one of the children, and she\nmade derogatory statements about him to a third party. Mother does not appeal those contempt findings.\nThe district court did not find her in contempt for lack of supervision or for failing to train the children to\nobey and respect their teachers and the law.\n\n\n                                                        1\n\f                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b65] \u201cDistrict courts have the inherent power to punish contempt, and we will not disturb\na contempt order in a domestic relations case absent a \u2018serious procedural error, a violation\nof a principle of law, or a clear and grave abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d Heimer v. Heimer, 2021\nWY 97, \u00b6 31, 494 P.3d 472, 481 (Wyo. 2021) (quoting Breen v. Black, 2020 WY 94, \u00b6 8,\n467 P.3d 1023, 1026 (Wyo. 2020)); Jenkins v. Jenkins, 2020 WY 120, \u00b6 5, 472 P.3d 370,\n372 (Wyo. 2020). \u201cIn reviewing how the district court exercised its broad discretion under\nits contempt power, our task is to determine whether the court could reasonably conclude\nas it did.\u201d Burrow v. Sieler, 2021 WY 120, \u00b6 14, 497 P.3d 921, 925 (Wyo. 2021) (citing\nHeimer, 2021 WY 97, \u00b6 31, 494 P.3d at 481).\n\n[\u00b66] We give deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings and \u201cwill overturn them\nonly upon a finding that they are clearly erroneous.\u201d Lew v. Lew, 2019 WY 99, \u00b6 8, 449\nP.3d 683, 686 (Wyo. 2019) (citing Walters v. Walters, 2011 WY 41, \u00b6 18, 249 P.3d 214,\n227 (Wyo. 2011)). \u201cFactual findings are clearly erroneous when, although they have\nevidentiary support, we are left with the definite and firm conviction upon review of the\nentire evidence that the district court made a mistake.\u201d Id. (quoting Walters, 2011 WY 41,\n\u00b6 18, 249 P.3d at 227.)\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n[\u00b67]   In Heimer, we said:\n\n                     To establish civil contempt, the plaintiff must show by\n              clear and convincing evidence that: 1) there was an effective\n              court order requiring certain conduct by the alleged contemnor;\n              2) the contemnor had knowledge of the order; and 3) the\n              alleged contemnor willfully disobeyed the order. In order to\n              find a willful violation, the order violated must be clear,\n              specific and unambiguous.\n\n                    A civil contempt order must be supported by clear and\n              convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is\n              evidence that would persuade a finder of fact that the truth of\n              the contention is highly probable. Once the elements of\n              contempt are proven, the burden then shifts to the person\n              charged with contempt to show he or she was unable to\n              comply.\n\nHeimer, 2021 WY 97, \u00b6 15, 494 P.3d at 477 (quoting Breen, 2020 WY 94, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 467\nP.3d at 1027). \u201cUsing this framework, we consider the district court\u2019s contempt findings.\u201d\nJLK v. MAB, 2016 WY 73, \u00b6 22, 375 P.3d 1108, 1113 (Wyo. 2016).\n\n\n                                             2\n\fI.     The district court did not err when it found Mother in contempt.\n\nA.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to pay her share of the\n       uninsured medical expenses.\n\n[\u00b68] Mother contends the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\npay her share of the uninsured medical expenses. We disagree. The Decree lists the relevant\nrequirements for the parents; Father and Mother \u201cshall share the responsibility equally for\npaying any uninsured medical, dental, orthodontic, optometric, ophthalmologic, mental\nhealth and all similar or related expenses incurred by the minor child.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[t]he\nparent incurring uninsured medical expenses for the minor child shall submit the bills for\nsaid expenses . . . to the other parent no later than thirty (30) days of receiving such bills[,]\u201d\nand \u201c[t]he other parent shall promptly remit payment for such expenses no later than thirty\n(30) days after being presented with a bill for such services[.]\u201d\n\n[\u00b69] Father and Mother both testified at the order to show cause hearing. Mother claimed\nshe did not have enough information to comply with the Decree. She testified she had seen\nand opened the bills from Father, had the funds and resources available to make payments,\nbut she did not because she did not know the terms of Father\u2019s health insurance policy and\nthe amounts not covered by insurance. Father\u2019s Exhibit 1, admitted into evidence without\nobjection, contained his spreadsheet tracking the total amount of uninsured medical\nexpenses for the children and the half Mother owed. Exhibit 1 also contained copies of the\nbills and evidence Father had sent the bills to Mother. He testified a copy of his insurance\npolicy was on file with the court, he had given the Explanation of Benefits to Mother\ndirectly five times, and he had not received a payment for two and a half years.\n\n[\u00b610] The district court found:\n\n               I think that [Father] has clearly established that the mother has\n               not paid her half share of the unpaid medical expenses. There\n               is a clear provision . . . that puts the burden on [Mother] to pay\n               one-half of all uncovered medical expenses of the children\n               once she has been provided with the evidence, the bills and the\n               expenses.\n\n                       I do find that [Father] did establish that he provided the\n               medical bills and expenses to his ex-wife. Exhibit 1 is very\n               complete. And there is certainly evidence that [Mother] was\n               provided with the medical bills and records showing she did\n               have an obligation to pay half of those bills. I do find that her\n               failure to pay was willful.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                                              ...\n\n                     I don\u2019t buy her explanation that she did not have enough\n              information under the policy to pay the bills. I find [Father\u2019s]\n              testimony more credible, that he had provided her with\n              explanations and information, and that she just willfully\n              refused to pay her share of those bills.\n\n[\u00b611] Upon review, we find the district court did not err. Mother did not argue below the\norder was ambiguous and the conduct required of her was uncertain, so those arguments\nare waived. Fowles v. Fowles, 2017 WY 112, \u00b6 28, 402 P.3d 405, 411 (Wyo. 2017) (\u201cWe\ngenerally do not consider arguments on appeal that were not presented to the district\ncourt.\u201d) (citing Crofts v. State ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Game & Fish, 2016 WY 4, \u00b6 19, 367 P.3d\n619, 624 (Wyo. 2016)). We also reject Mother\u2019s argument the district court improperly\nshifted the burden to her under Breen v. Black. In its oral ruling, the district court\nacknowledged Breen:\n\n                     The Breen v. Black case that I\u2019ve cited is an interesting\n              case, somewhat similar set of facts where a father was alleging\n              that the mother had not paid her half share of the medical\n              expenses. The court in that particular case found that the father\n              had failed to meet his burden because he hadn\u2019t brought forth\n              the medical bills and hadn\u2019t sufficiently explained by clear and\n              convincing evidence that he had paid those bills.\n\n                     Here, in contrast, I think the Plaintiff, the father, has met\n              that burden. He has shown that he paid those bills and did\n              provide the bills to [Mother] to pay. She did not pay those bills.\n\n[\u00b612] The district court correctly interpreted and applied Breen. Father submitted evidence\nshowing he provided the bills to Mother and she had not paid her portion. The district court\nproperly shifted the burden to Mother to prove payment, and she did not. Further, the\ndistrict court found Father\u2019s testimony more credible, and \u201c[o]ur rule is that the credibility\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved by\nthe finder of fact.\u201d JLK, 2016 WY 73, \u00b6 28, 375 P.3d at 1114 (quoting McAdam v. McAdam,\n2014 WY 123, \u00b6 26, 335 P.3d 466, 472 (Wyo. 2014)). \u201cGiving these weight and credibility\ndeterminations their due deference, we can find no abuse of discretion[.]\u201d Id. The district\ncourt did not err.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fB.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to follow medical\n       directives regarding their oldest child.\n\n[\u00b613] Next, Mother contends the district court erred when it held Mother in contempt for\nfailing to follow medical directives for the parents\u2019 oldest child. The Decree provided: \u201call\nmedical directives pertaining to the minor children must be followed th[r]ough.\u201d\n\n[\u00b614] At the order to show cause hearing, Father testified their oldest son was diagnosed\nwith constipation. Two doctors gave directives for a treatment plan that called for the child\nto take MiraLAX and Ex-Lax daily. Mother did not follow through on this directive\nregularly, which required the regimen to be \u201creset\u201d instead of keeping it at the daily\nmaintenance phase. Mother presented conflicting testimony, claiming she always followed\nthe doctors\u2019 recommendations; however, she also stated: \u201cI won\u2019t give my son Ex-Lax\nevery day.\u201d\n\n[\u00b615] In its oral ruling, the district court stated:\n\n                      I also find that she is in contempt for failing to follow\n               medical directives that have been provided to her by the\n               doctors with respect to having her oldest child, who suffers\n               from a constipation issue, take the medication that is required\n               to take, the MiraLAX and the Ex-Lax. Medical records have\n               established that they \u2013 that the son had a daily regimen which\n               required him to take that.\n\n                       And by her own testimony, [Mother] does not believe\n               that the Ex-Lax should be given, and where the doctors have\n               stated that it should be given to the child. So I find that she is\n               in contempt for failing to follow the medical directives.\n\n[\u00b616] On appeal, Mother claims the order and medical directives were unclear and the\ndistrict court violated her rights to parent and make health care decisions for her child under\nthe Wyoming Constitution. Mother did not raise these arguments below, and although this\nCourt can consider jurisdictional or issues of a fundamental nature for the first time on\nappeal, \u201c[t]he fact that an issue touches on constitutional principles does not necessarily\nmake it so fundamental the waiver rule does not apply.\u201d Snyder v. Snyder, 2021 WY 115,\n\u00b6 26, 496 P.3d 1255, 1261 (Wyo. 2021) (citing Gjertsen v. Haar, 2015 WY 56, \u00b6 15, 347\nP.3d 1117, 1123 (Wyo. 2015)) (finding appellant\u2019s constitutional claims waived as he made\n\u201cno effort to demonstrate why his argument was not waived and deserves consideration on\nappeal even though he did not raise it below\u201d). Further, Mother did not demonstrate why\nher arguments are not waived or merit consideration on appeal. Therefore this Court will\nnot address these arguments.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f[\u00b617] Based on the testimony presented by the parties at the order to show cause hearing,\nthe district court could reasonably conclude as it did. We therefore find no abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\nC.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to seek Father\u2019s advice\n       and consent before reengaging the children in counseling.\n\n[\u00b618] Mother argues the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\nconsult Father before reengaging the children in counseling. The Decree provided:\n\n               c. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to\n                  necessary and/or elective medical procedures, whenever\n                  possible and shall advise each other at all times of any\n                  issues affecting the welfare of the children[.]\n\n               d. The parties shall, to the extent possible or practicable, seek\n                  each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\n                  decision concerning the minor children\u2019s health, education\n                  or welfare[.]\n\n[\u00b619] Father testified both children had seen a licensed professional counselor in the past,\nbut he thought counseling had ended when the counselor retired. Father later learned\nMother had retained the same counselor to make home visits while the children visited\nMother. Father testified he was not consulted about their children reengaging in counseling.\nMother testified she reengaged the counselor for the children and stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell\n[Father] specifically, but I didn\u2019t tell the boys it was a secret. . . . I thought if I was paying\nfor it, I could do that.\u201d\n\n[\u00b620] The district court found Mother violated the consultation provisions:\n\n                      It is concerning to the court that in October of 2021 the\n               evidence shows that [Mother] did decide on her own that she\n               wanted to reengage the services of [counselor]. She did not\n               discuss that decision or did not discuss that decision with\n               [Father] before she did it.\n\n                       [Father], the court notes, is the final decision-maker\n               with respect to medical decisions for the children and was\n               entitled to be advised and consulted before [Mother]\n               unilaterally decided on her own to reengage the services of\n               [counselor]. So I find her in contempt[.]\n\n\n                                                6\n\f[\u00b621] The Decree did not make the consultation requirement contingent on who paid for\nthe children\u2019s treatment or services, so Mother was not excused from the requirement\nbecause she paid the counselor directly. The testimony of both parties showed Mother did\nnot seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before reengaging the boys in counseling, and the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in holding Mother in contempt for that violation.\nLike her constitutional claims described above, Mother\u2019s additional argument that this\ncontempt finding violates her constitutional right to parent and make medical decisions for\nher children is waived because she did not raise it below.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n[\u00b622] The district court did not err when it held Mother in contempt, and we affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and order.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                IN THE SUPREME COURT, STATE OF WYOMING\n\n                                              </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WY 7</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n                                                                  OCTOBER TERM, A.D. 2023\n\n                                                                           January 19, 2024\n\n\n RACHEL E.

Bennett (Mother) in contempt for failing to follow\nthe terms of its Order Modifying Decree of Divorce and entered judgment against her. She\nappeals, and we affirm.\n\n                                                    ISSUE\n\n[\u00b62]    Mother presented two issues on appeal, which we consolidate as one:\n\n                 1. Did the district court err when it found Mother in contempt?\n\n                                                    FACTS\n\n[\u00b63] Matthew J. (Father) and Rachel E. (Mother) Bennett divorced in 2013. The 2018\nStipulated Order Modifying Stipulated Decree of Divorce (Decree) awarded Father\nprimary physical custody of their two minor children, and the parties were to share joint\nlegal custody. The Decree contained other provisions relevant to this appeal. First, the\nparents were required to split the payments evenly for any uninsured medical expenses.\nSecond, the parents were to follow all medical directives pertaining to the children. Third,\nthe parents were to seek each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\ndecision regarding the children\u2019s health, education, or welfare.\n\n[\u00b64] In 2022, Father filed a motion for order to show cause, asking the district court to\norder Mother to appear and show cause why the court should not hold her in contempt for\nfailing to comply with the three Decree provisions listed above, among others. 1 At the order\nto show cause hearing, the district court issued an oral ruling finding Mother in contempt,\nwhich was followed by a written order. The district court entered judgment for the unpaid\nmedical bills of $4,652.07 and awarded Father attorney fees. Mother appeals the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment and order finding her in contempt for failing to pay her share of uninsured\nmedical bills; to follow medical directives; and to seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before\nreengaging the children in counseling. 2\n\n\n\n1\n  Father also claimed Mother: (1) failed to nurture love and respect for him; (2) disparaged him to the\nchildren; (3) failed to train the children to obey and respect their teachers and the law; (4) failed to personally\nsupervise one of the children; (5) engaged in obscenities in front of the children; (6) intruded upon his\nprivacy and falsely made or implied mean statements about him; and (7) vilified him, all in violation of the\nDecree.\n2\n  The district court also found Mother in contempt of the Decree\u2019s civility provisions because she sent\nFather inappropriate text messages, she accused Father of poaching in front of one of the children, and she\nmade derogatory statements about him to a third party. Mother does not appeal those contempt findings.\nThe district court did not find her in contempt for lack of supervision or for failing to train the children to\nobey and respect their teachers and the law.\n\n\n                                                        1\n\f                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b65] \u201cDistrict courts have the inherent power to punish contempt, and we will not disturb\na contempt order in a domestic relations case absent a \u2018serious procedural error, a violation\nof a principle of law, or a clear and grave abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d Heimer v.

In order to\n              find a willful violation, the order violated must be clear,\n              specific and unambiguous.\n\n                    A civil contempt order must be supported by clear and\n              convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is\n              evidence that would persuade a finder of fact that the truth of\n              the contention is highly probable. Once the elements of\n              contempt are proven, the burden then shifts to the person\n              charged with contempt to show he or she was unable to\n              comply.\n\nHeimer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WY 97</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 15, 494 P.3d at 477 (quoting Breen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 WY 94</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 467\nP.3d at 1027). \u201cUsing this framework, we consider the district court\u2019s contempt findings.\u201d\nJLK v.

The district court did not err when it found Mother in contempt.\n\nA.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to pay her share of the\n       uninsured medical expenses.\n\n[\u00b68] Mother contends the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\npay her share of the uninsured medical expenses. We disagree. The Decree lists the relevant\nrequirements for the parents; Father and Mother \u201cshall share the responsibility equally for\npaying any uninsured medical, dental, orthodontic, optometric, ophthalmologic, mental\nhealth and all similar or related expenses incurred by the minor child.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[t]he\nparent incurring uninsured medical expenses for the minor child shall submit the bills for\nsaid expenses . . . to the other parent no later than thirty (30) days of receiving such bills[,]\u201d\nand \u201c[t]he other parent shall promptly remit payment for such expenses no later than thirty\n(30) days after being presented with a bill for such services[.]\u201d\n\n[\u00b69] Father and Mother both testified at the order to show cause hearing. Mother claimed\nshe did not have enough information to comply with the Decree. She testified she had seen\nand opened the bills from Father, had the funds and resources available to make payments,\nbut she did not because she did not know the terms of Father\u2019s health insurance policy and\nthe amounts not covered by insurance. Father\u2019s Exhibit 1, admitted into evidence without\nobjection, contained his spreadsheet tracking the total amount of uninsured medical\nexpenses for the children and the half Mother owed. Exhibit 1 also contained copies of the\nbills and evidence Father had sent the bills to Mother. He testified a copy of his insurance\npolicy was on file with the court, he had given the Explanation of Benefits to Mother\ndirectly five times, and he had not received a payment for two and a half years.\n\n[\u00b610] The district court found:\n\n               I think that [Father] has clearly established that the mother has\n               not paid her half share of the unpaid medical expenses. There\n               is a clear provision . . . that puts the burden on [Mother] to pay\n               one-half of all uncovered medical expenses of the children\n               once she has been provided with the evidence, the bills and the\n               expenses.\n\n                       I do find that [Father] did establish that he provided the\n               medical bills and expenses to his ex-wife. Exhibit 1 is very\n               complete. And there is certainly evidence that [Mother] was\n               provided with the medical bills and records showing she did\n               have an obligation to pay half of those bills.

I find [Father\u2019s]\n              testimony more credible, that he had provided her with\n              explanations and information, and that she just willfully\n              refused to pay her share of those bills.\n\n[\u00b611] Upon review, we find the district court did not err. Mother did not argue below the\norder was ambiguous and the conduct required of her was uncertain, so those arguments\nare waived. Fowles v.

We also reject Mother\u2019s argument the district court improperly\nshifted the burden to her under Breen v. Black. In its oral ruling, the district court\nacknowledged Breen:\n\n                     The Breen v. Black case that I\u2019ve cited is an interesting\n              case, somewhat similar set of facts where a father was alleging\n              that the mother had not paid her half share of the medical\n              expenses. The court in that particular case found that the father\n              had failed to meet his burden because he hadn\u2019t brought forth\n              the medical bills and hadn\u2019t sufficiently explained by clear and\n              convincing evidence that he had paid those bills.\n\n                     Here, in contrast, I think the Plaintiff, the father, has met\n              that burden. He has shown that he paid those bills and did\n              provide the bills to [Mother] to pay. She did not pay those bills.\n\n[\u00b612] The district court correctly interpreted and applied Breen. Father submitted evidence\nshowing he provided the bills to Mother and she had not paid her portion. The district court\nproperly shifted the burden to Mother to prove payment, and she did not. Further, the\ndistrict court found Father\u2019s testimony more credible, and \u201c[o]ur rule is that the credibility\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved by\nthe finder of fact.\u201d JLK, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2016 WY 73</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 28, 375 P.3d at 1114 (quoting McAdam v.

The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to follow medical\n       directives regarding their oldest child.\n\n[\u00b613] Next, Mother contends the district court erred when it held Mother in contempt for\nfailing to follow medical directives for the parents\u2019 oldest child. The Decree provided: \u201call\nmedical directives pertaining to the minor children must be followed th[r]ough.\u201d\n\n[\u00b614] At the order to show cause hearing, Father testified their oldest son was diagnosed\nwith constipation. Two doctors gave directives for a treatment plan that called for the child\nto take MiraLAX and Ex-Lax daily. Mother did not follow through on this directive\nregularly, which required the regimen to be \u201creset\u201d instead of keeping it at the daily\nmaintenance phase. Mother presented conflicting testimony, claiming she always followed\nthe doctors\u2019 recommendations; however, she also stated: \u201cI won\u2019t give my son Ex-Lax\nevery day.\u201d\n\n[\u00b615] In its oral ruling, the district court stated:\n\n                      I also find that she is in contempt for failing to follow\n               medical directives that have been provided to her by the\n               doctors with respect to having her oldest child, who suffers\n               from a constipation issue, take the medication that is required\n               to take, the MiraLAX and the Ex-Lax. Medical records have\n               established that they \u2013 that the son had a daily regimen which\n               required him to take that.\n\n                       And by her own testimony, [Mother] does not believe\n               that the Ex-Lax should be given, and where the doctors have\n               stated that it should be given to the child. So I find that she is\n               in contempt for failing to follow the medical directives.\n\n[\u00b616] On appeal, Mother claims the order and medical directives were unclear and the\ndistrict court violated her rights to parent and make health care decisions for her child under\nthe Wyoming Constitution. Mother did not raise these arguments below, and although this\nCourt can consider jurisdictional or issues of a fundamental nature for the first time on\nappeal, \u201c[t]he fact that an issue touches on constitutional principles does not necessarily\nmake it so fundamental the waiver rule does not apply.\u201d Snyder v.

Further, Mother did not demonstrate why\nher arguments are not waived or merit consideration on appeal. Therefore this Court will\nnot address these arguments.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f[\u00b617] Based on the testimony presented by the parties at the order to show cause hearing,\nthe district court could reasonably conclude as it did. We therefore find no abuse of\ndiscretion.\n\nC.     The district court did not err in finding Mother failed to seek Father\u2019s advice\n       and consent before reengaging the children in counseling.\n\n[\u00b618] Mother argues the district court erred when it found her in contempt for failing to\nconsult Father before reengaging the children in counseling. The Decree provided:\n\n               c. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to\n                  necessary and/or elective medical procedures, whenever\n                  possible and shall advise each other at all times of any\n                  issues affecting the welfare of the children[.]\n\n               d. The parties shall, to the extent possible or practicable, seek\n                  each other\u2019s advice and consent prior to any non-emergency\n                  decision concerning the minor children\u2019s health, education\n                  or welfare[.]\n\n[\u00b619] Father testified both children had seen a licensed professional counselor in the past,\nbut he thought counseling had ended when the counselor retired. Father later learned\nMother had retained the same counselor to make home visits while the children visited\nMother. Father testified he was not consulted about their children reengaging in counseling.\nMother testified she reengaged the counselor for the children and stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell\n[Father] specifically, but I didn\u2019t tell the boys it was a secret. . . . I thought if I was paying\nfor it, I could do that.\u201d\n\n[\u00b620] The district court found Mother violated the consultation provisions:\n\n                      It is concerning to the court that in October of 2021 the\n               evidence shows that [Mother] did decide on her own that she\n               wanted to reengage the services of [counselor]. She did not\n               discuss that decision or did not discuss that decision with\n               [Father] before she did it.\n\n                       [Father], the court notes, is the final decision-maker\n               with respect to medical decisions for the children and was\n               entitled to be advised and consulted before [Mother]\n               unilaterally decided on her own to reengage the services of\n               [counselor]. So I find her in contempt[.]\n\n\n                                                6\n\f[\u00b621] The Decree did not make the consultation requirement contingent on who paid for\nthe children\u2019s treatment or services, so Mother was not excused from the requirement\nbecause she paid the counselor directly. The testimony of both parties showed Mother did\nnot seek Father\u2019s advice and consent before reengaging the boys in counseling, and the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in holding Mother in contempt for that violation.\nLike her constitutional claims described above, Mother\u2019s additional argument that this\ncontempt finding violates her constitutional right to parent and make medical decisions for\nher children is waived because she did not raise it below.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n[\u00b622] The district court did not err when it held Mother in contempt, and we affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s judgment and order.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": []}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925381/", "id": 9925381, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467543/state-v-jason-m-bockus/", "cluster_id": 9467543, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467543/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:15:45.063003-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:24:26.635083-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "7145be92f5e8d6ed937d08cc80563e758355e7bf", "page_count": 15, "download_url": "https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/media/17260", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/state_v._jason_m._bockus.pdf", "plain_text": "NOTICE: This opinion is subject to motions for reargument under V.R.A.P. 40 as well as formal\nrevision before publication in the Vermont Reports.

CARROLL, J.         Defendant Jason Bockus appeals a judgment of conviction for\n\nassault and robbery following a jury trial. He contends that the trial court erred in not suppressing\n\nout-of-court noneyewitness identifications and denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant also argues that the court impermissibly punished him with a harsher sentence for\n\nexercising his right to go to trial. We affirm.\n\n                                           I. Background\n\n        \u00b6 2.   The following is adduced from testimony and exhibits admitted at trial, and from\n\nfacts found by the trial court in its order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress out-of-court\n\nidentifications. In early December 2020, a man entered an Irving service station in Highgate,\n\fVermont just before 11 p.m. Multiple surveillance cameras showed the man wearing a hoodie,\n\nbeanie, and mask that obscured most, but not all of, his face. The man told the two service-station\n\nemployees on duty that he had a gun and ordered them to open the cash drawer. One of the\n\nattendants opened the drawer. The man took $190 and left. Neither attendant could identify the\n\nman.\n\n        \u00b6 3.     Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Baker led the investigation into the\n\nrobbery. She posted stills of the suspect taken from the surveillance footage to the Vermont State\n\nPolice Facebook page. A local resident, Christopher Uzell, responded to the posting and told\n\nDetective Baker that defendant resembled the suspect. He informed Detective Baker that he had\n\nknown defendant for about twenty years and recognized defendant\u2019s distinctive eyes. In addition\n\nto using the surveillance footage to obtain further positive identifications from defendant\u2019s\n\nprobation officer, Greg Machia, and the manager of a sober house where defendant had once lived,\n\nHarley LaRocque, Detective Baker questioned several members of defendant\u2019s family to confirm\n\nthe identity of the perpetrator.\n\n        \u00b6 4.     Detective Baker interviewed each family member individually and used the same\n\nprocedure with each person. She told them that she was investigating the robbery at the Irving\n\nstation in Highgate and asked to show them surveillance footage and stills of the footage to see if\n\nthey recognized the perpetrator. Detective Baker first played surveillance footage, then showed\n\nstills from the footage, and then, following the person\u2019s identification of defendant, showed a\n\nmugshot and a Facebook photograph from defendant\u2019s personal account to confirm that they were\n\ntalking about the same person. She did not tell them that she suspected defendant of committing\n\nthe crime depicted in the presentation materials, and she provided no commentary while they\n\nwatched the footage.1 Ultimately, defendant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, TJ and Chantell Bockus,\n\n\n\n        1\n            There was no audio recording of the incident.\n                                                  2\n\fdefendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, Brittany Blaisdell, and Blaisdell\u2019s mother, Deena\n\nRaymond, all identified defendant as the suspect. Each person expressed their belief that defendant\n\nwas the perpetrator because the person in the video had defendant\u2019s same distinctive body\n\nmovements and unique eyes, among other characteristics. Some family members informed one\n\nanother that they believed defendant \u201cmight\u201d be the person depicted in the footage prior to\n\nDetective Baker\u2019s questioning. For various reasons, each family member expressed fear that\n\ndefendant could retaliate if he learned that they had identified him, and frustration with \u201cthe\n\nsystem\u201d in which defendant had been involved for years.\n\n       \u00b6 5.      Based on the above, the State charged defendant with one count of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), and with being a habitual offender with three\n\nprior felony convictions, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 11, which carried the possibility of life imprisonment.\n\n       \u00b6 6.      Defendant moved to suppress the out-of-court identifications made by Chantell and\n\nTJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena Raymond under Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution.\n\nHe contended that Detective Baker had used an unduly suggestive comparison lineup to obtain the\n\nidentifications, and because the noneyewitnesses knew others had already identified defendant\n\nbefore viewing the presentation themselves, their own identifications were tainted by confirmation\n\nbias. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Detective\n\nBaker had not used unnecessarily suggestive investigation techniques, that suggestive\n\ncircumstances not created by law enforcement are \u201cirrelevant\u201d under State v. Porter, 2014 VT 89,\n\n197 Vt. 330, 103 A.3d 916, and that even if the circumstances were suggestive, the identifications\n\nwere reliable.\n\n       \u00b6 7.      At trial, Uzell, Machia, LaRocque, the Bockuses, and Blaisdell testified for the\n\nState. Uzell testified that he was eighty-percent sure of his identification, Machia said that he was\n\nmore than \u201cninety-nine-point nine percent sure,\u201d and LaRocque averred that he was a \u201cseven or\n\neight\u201d on a scale of one to ten about his identification. Chantell and TJ Bockus, and Brittany\n\n                                                 3\n\fBlaisdell each testified that they were convinced that defendant was the perpetrator. The State\n\nalso called Lynn Knight, with whom defendant had been living at the time of the robbery. Knight\n\ntestified that she was initially seventy-five percent sure that defendant was the perpetrator, but later\n\ndisclaimed her identification.\n\n       \u00b6 8.    At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant argued that the State had failed to proffer sufficient evidence proving beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that he was the robber because it relied exclusively on out-of-court identifications\n\nby noneyewitnesses, many of whom harbored biases and \u201cagendas\u201d against defendant. He also\n\ncontended that the State failed to prove that the perpetrator had been carrying a deadly weapon\n\nduring the robbery. Taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the State, and excluding\n\nmodifying evidence, the court found that the State\u2019s witnesses had credibly testified that defendant\n\nwas the suspect in the surveillance footage, and the service-station employees had credibly testified\n\nthat it appeared to them that the man had been carrying a handgun.\n\n       \u00b6 9.    At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on the elements of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon as follows:\n\n               (1) [defendant]; (2) [a]ttempted to put . . . gas station store\n               clerks . . . in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; (3) [h]e did so\n               by using physical menace; (4) [h]e also took money or other\n               property . . . (5) [h]e took the money or other property with the\n               intent to deprive [the gas station] of it permanently; and (6) [a]t the\n               time, he was armed with a dangerous weapon.\n\nThe court clarified that: \u201cphysical menace means a threat by word or act to inflict physical injury\n\nupon another person\u201d and that \u201cthe State alleges that Mr. Bockus attempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband.\u201d The State requested an instruction on the lesser-included\n\ncharge of assault and robbery. Without objection, the court instructed the jury that the first five\n\nelements of assault and robbery were \u201cdefined in the same way as they are defined for assault and\n\n\n                                                   4\n\frobbery with a deadly weapon,\u201d except that \u201c[t]he State need not have proven that Mr. Bockus[]\n\nwas armed with a dangerous weapon at the time.\u201d\n\n       \u00b6 10.   The jury found defendant not guilty of assault and robbery with a deadly weapon.\n\nIt found him guilty of the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery, and of being a habitual\n\noffender. At sentencing, the State recommended ten-to-twenty-five-years to serve. Defendant\n\nrequested a sentence of two-and-a-half-to-five-years to serve. The court ultimately sentenced\n\ndefendant ten-to-fifteen-years to serve, opining:\n\n               So even though the weight of the evidence was perhaps not\n               overwhelming, it was compelling, and the jurors certainly found that\n               it was. And while the Court can\u2019t comment on someone\u2019s\n               willingness and ability and right to go to trial, the fact is that folks\n               who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result because\n               they\u2019ve accepted responsibility. And Mr. Bockus certainly has not\n               accepted responsibility, which leads the Court to believe that the\n               programming part of this, to the extent that it exists, is probably not\n               going to be helpful for him because he\u2019s not at that point. I don\u2019t\n               even think he\u2019s, what they call, pre-contemplative at this point in\n               regards to his willingness to make changes in his life.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n       \u00b6 11.   Defendant advances several arguments on appeal. He argues that the court erred in\n\nnot suppressing the identifications made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond because Detective Baker used unnecessarily suggestive means to obtain the\n\nidentifications. Specifically, he contends that Detective Baker\u2019s decision to interview \u201cestranged\n\nfamily members\u201d was unnecessarily suggestive, as was her failure to ask the witnesses not to\n\ndiscuss their own identifications with each other. He argues that the identifications are also\n\nunreliable and should have been suppressed. Defendant asserts that the court improperly relied on\n\nState v. Porter for the proposition that suggestibility is irrelevant where the challenged\n\ncircumstances are not arranged by law enforcement. Defendant further contends that the court\n\nerred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and deprived him of due process by imposing\n\nan impermissibly harsh sentence because he exercised his right to trial.\n\n                                                    5\n\f       \u00b6 12.   We hold that the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We\n\nagree with the trial court that the identifications of defendant were not made under unduly\n\nsuggestive circumstances.      Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether the\n\nidentifications were reliable for purposes of defendant\u2019s due process rights, nor do we decide\n\nwhether we review purportedly suggestive out-of-court identifications not arranged by police\n\nunder Article 10. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nand detect no vindictiveness toward defendant from the trial court that would justify disturbing the\n\nsentence it imposed.\n\n                          II. Out-of-Court Noneyewitness Identifications\n\n       \u00b6 13.   We turn first to the question of whether the trial court should have suppressed the\n\nidentifications of defendant made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond. We review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions in an order denying a motion to suppress\n\nwithout deference and defer to its factual findings absent clear error. State v. Discola, 2018 VT 7,\n\n\u00b6 26, 207 Vt. 216, 184 A.3d 1177.\n\n       \u00b6 14.   The Vermont Constitution provides that criminal defendants shall have the right \u201cto\n\nbe confronted with the witnesses\u201d against them. Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10. The Court applies the\n\ntwo-part test first set forth in Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977), to determine whether an\n\nout-of-court identification procedure violates that right. Porter, 2014 VT 89, \u00b6 20, overruled on\n\nother grounds by Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 30. We first consider the circumstances surrounding the\n\nidentification to determine whether they were unnecessarily suggestive. State v. Kasper, 137 Vt.\n\n184, 192, 404 A.2d 85, 90 (1979), overruled on other grounds by Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 30. The\n\ntouchstone of this inquiry is whether the method was \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise\n\nto a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d State v. Mayo, 2008 VT 2, \u00b6 18,\n\n183 Vt. 113, 945 A.2d 846 (quotation omitted). Second, even \u201c[i]f suggestive, the identification\n\nis still admissible if certain indicia of reliability outweigh the corrupting effect of the suggestive\n\n                                                  6\n\fidentification.\u201d Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 27 (quotation omitted) (describing factors used to evaluate\n\nreliability).\n\n        \u00b6 15.   In determining whether an out-of-court identification was obtained under\n\nunnecessarily suggestive circumstances, in addition to considering the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we concentrate on the form of the presentation used by police. Mayo, 2008 VT 2,\n\n\u00b6 17. Factors we have considered include \u201chow the lineup was set up, how many photos were\n\narrayed, whether the photos were similar in size, color, or description, and the officer\u2019s\n\nadministration of the lineup.\u201d Id. This case presents the first time we have considered whether\n\npolice identification practices involving noneyewitnesses to a crime are unduly suggestive.\n\n        \u00b6 16.   The trial court found that each person spontaneously identified defendant only after\n\nwatching the surveillance footage without commentary from Detective Baker. Detective Baker\n\ndid not disclose defendant\u2019s name until after each person made a positive identification, at which\n\npoint she produced a photo of defendant to ensure that they were speaking about the same person.\n\nWe conclude that this procedure was not unduly suggestive. The form of Detective Baker\u2019s\n\npresentation is not like our prior cases involving suggestive methods where an eyewitness was\n\nshown a display of multiple photos of the defendant in a single array, Kasper, 137 Vt. at 192, 404\n\nA.2d at 90, a presentation consisting solely of one photo of the defendant was shown to an\n\neyewitness, State v. Findlay, 171 Vt. 594, 597, 765 A.2d 483, 487 (2000) (mem.), or an in-court\n\nidentification of a defendant was made by two eyewitnesses who had seen a photograph of the\n\ndefendant shortly before the hearing and who was dressed in a prisoner\u2019s uniform and bound in\n\nshackles. Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 28. In contrast to the identification procedures used in those\n\ncases, Detective Baker did not show unmasked depictions of defendant until after each\n\nnoneyewitness viewed the surveillance footage and identified defendant of their own accord. See\n\nState v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 386-87, 488 A.2d 1231, 1234 (1985) (holding procedure not\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fsuggestive where police showed eyewitness twenty-seven photographs one-by-one and made no\n\nsuggestions \u201cemphasizing one photograph over another\u201d).\n\n        \u00b6 17.   Moreover, because neither of the store employees could identify the perpetrator, it\n\nwas reasonable for Detective Baker to seek out family members who might be in a position to\n\nidentify him. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 130 N.E.3d 174, 186 (Mass. 2019) (holding that\n\npolice had \u201cgood reason\u201d to have victim\u2019s family members attempt to identify person in\n\nsurveillance footage where no eyewitnesses could do so). The totality of the circumstances in this\n\ncase\u2014including the nature of the surveillance footage, the tip Detective Baker received about the\n\npossible identity of the perpetrator, her choice to ask family members of defendant to identify the\n\nperpetrator via surveillance footage to confirm the tip, and the method she used to obtain the\n\nidentifications\u2014does not give rise to the danger of \u201cirreparable mistaken identification.\u201d\n\nBissonette, 145 Vt. at 385, 488 A.2d at 1233.\n\n        \u00b6 18.   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reached the same conclusion on similar\n\nfacts in Commonwealth v. Vasquez. There, surveillance cameras recorded audio and visual\n\ndepictions of a man shooting and killing a woman in a parked car. There were no \u201cpercipient\u201d\n\neyewitnesses to the shooting. 130 N.E.3d at 186. Police questioned members of the victim\u2019s\n\nfamily who, before arriving at the police station, had spoken to one another and surmised that the\n\nvictim had been involved in a shooting and that the defendant was the likely perpetrator.\n\nInterviewing the witnesses separately, police presented each witness, in order, a photograph of the\n\ndefendant, an audio recording of the incident, and surveillance footage. Police did not suggest the\n\ndefendant\u2019s involvement and provided no \u201cconfirmatory feedback\u201d to the witnesses. Id. at 185\n\nn.16.   The Massachusetts high court reasoned that the form of the presentation was not\n\nunnecessarily suggestive because, without eyewitnesses who could identify the perpetrator, police\n\nhad good reason to believe that the victim\u2019s family members were in a position to identify the\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fshooter from the surveillance footage, police presented the identification materials separately, and\n\nthey did not include the audio or visual depiction of the gunshot.2 Id. at 186.\n\n       \u00b6 19.   We are also unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that Detective Baker\u2019s failure to\n\nask the witnesses to not speak with one another amounted to undue suggestiveness. The court\n\nfound Detective Baker\u2019s testimony credible regarding the identification procedure she used and\n\nfound the witnesses\u2019 testimony credible regarding their own identifications. The court found that\n\neach credibly \u201ctestified that they independently identified [defendant] based off the video\n\nsurveillance footage,\u201d and that any biases and knowledge that others had already identified\n\ndefendant \u201chad minimal influence\u201d on their own identifications.3 Based on the court\u2019s findings,\n\nwe conclude that the challenged identifications were not tainted by confirmation bias or animosity\n\ntoward defendant, and therefore were not spoiled by undue suggestiveness. Mayo, 2008 VT 2,\n\n\u00b6 14 (deferring to trial court to determine weight of evidence and its persuasive effect, witness\n\ncredibility, and noting that trial court\u2019s rulings will be affirmed if supported by law).\n\n       \u00b6 20.   We concur, however, with the Massachusetts high court that \u201cit was not ideal that,\n\nprior to making an identification, each witness was apparently aware that the victim had been killed\n\nand suspected the defendant\u2019s involvement.\u201d Vasquez, 130 N.E.3d at 185 n.16. And we agree\n\nthat, where feasible to do so, police should direct witnesses not to speak about their perceptions\n\nwith other witnesses prior to the identification proceedings. See id. Law enforcement \u201ccannot be\n\nexpected to prevent every conceivable exposure to external information,\u201d but should \u201cguard\n\nagainst the risk that a witness may be influenced by his or her conversations with . . . family\n\nmembers . . . before making an identification.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n       2\n          We note that police in Vazquez showed each witness a photograph of the defendant\nbefore playing the audio and visual recordings, which was not done here.\n       3\n          While these findings appear in the court\u2019s reliability analysis, they clearly apply to\nDetective Baker\u2019s methodology, which the court itself noted.\n                                              9\n\f       \u00b6 21.   While not ideal, the mere fact that the witnesses, prior to their own identifications,\n\nwere aware that others had potentially identified defendant in the surveillance footage does not\n\nalone render the identifications suggestive. We emphasize that each case involving out-of-court\n\nidentifications is dependent on its own unique circumstances, and our holding is accordingly\n\nnarrow. Discola, 2018 VT 7, \u00b6 27 (explaining that courts must examine circumstances surrounding\n\nidentification procedure). Because the circumstances surrounding the identifications in this case\n\nwere not unduly suggestive, we need not reach the question of reliability. See Mayo, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19\n\n(explaining that where challenged procedure was not suggestive, Court need not proceed to step\n\ntwo of Brathwaite test to screen for reliability because procedure does not \u201cgive rise to a very\n\nsubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d (quotation omitted)).\n\n       \u00b6 22.   Defendant next takes issue with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that where police do\n\nnot arrange the suggestive circumstances, under State v. Porter, 2014 VT 89, Article 10 does not\n\napply to out-of-court identifications. Defendant spends considerable time in his briefing asking\n\nthe Court not to extend the U.S. Supreme Court case cited in Porter, Perry v. New Hampshire, 565\n\nU.S. 228 (2012), to the Vermont Constitution.4 He argues that we should instead hold that due\n\nprocess protections attach to all suggestive identifications, involving police or not, and that the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts follows this approach. We do not decide defendant\u2019s\n\nconstitutional claim because, as discussed above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the\n\nsuppression motion on an alternative basis, namely, that there were no suggestive identifications\n\nto begin with.5 See State v. Bauder, 2007 VT 16, \u00b6 27, 181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38 (\u201cIt is . . .a\n\n\n       4\n         In Perry, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, because the reliability screening function in\nBrathwaite test is designed to deter police misconduct, where suggestive identifications are not\narranged by police, courts do not need to screen for reliability. 565 U.S. at 241-42.\n       5\n          Defendant\u2019s citations to State v. Porter for the proposition that courts will limit or\nsuppress suggestive identification testimony is to the portion of the opinion reviewing the\ndefendant\u2019s preserved Vermont Rule of Evidence 403 claim, not his due process claim. See, e.g.,\n2014 VT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26; cf. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 45 N.E.3d 83, 88-90 (Mass. 2016)\n                                              10\n\ffundamental tenet of judicial restraint that courts will not address constitutional claims . . . when\n\nadequate lesser grounds are available.\u201d).\n\n                                     III. Judgment of Acquittal\n\n       \u00b6 23.   Defendant argues that the court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal. In effect, defendant contends that noneyewitnesses are insufficient to prove the identity\n\nelement where there is no physical evidence linking a defendant to a crime. He also argues that,\n\nas instructed, the jury could not have found defendant guilty of the lesser-included charge because\n\nthe State did not put on sufficient evidence to prove that defendant used physical menace to commit\n\nthe crime.\n\n       \u00b6 24.   We review a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal without deference to the\n\ntrial court. State v. Durenleau, 163 Vt. 8, 10, 652 A.2d 981, 982 (1994). We must \u201cdetermine\n\nwhether the evidence presented by the State, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution\n\nand excluding any modifying evidence, sufficiently and fairly supports a finding of guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Id.\n\n       \u00b6 25.   At trial, the State put on three nonfamily members\u2014Uzell, Machia, and\n\nLaRocque\u2014who testified that they were somewhere between seventy-percent sure and ninety-\n\nnine percent sure of defendant\u2019s identity based on the surveillance footage. Uzell and Machia\n\ntestified that they had known defendant for decades, and LaRocque had managed the group home\n\nwhere defendant lived in the months before the robbery. Chantell Bockus, TJ Bockus, and Brittany\n\nBlaisdell each testified that they were convinced defendant was the perpetrator and identified him\n\nin court. Though the Bockuses had not seen defendant in person since 2012, each testified that the\n\n\n\n(explaining that Massachusetts reviews suggestive out-of-court noneyewitness identifications not\narranged by law enforcement under its \u201ccommon law principles of fairness,\u201d including evidentiary\nrule 403) Defendant has not preserved a Rule 403 claim here, nor does he explain on appeal how\nit would have led to a different result than the reliability analysis in the Brathwaite test if he had\nraised it below. State v. Stanislaw, 153 Vt. 517, 528, 573 A.2d 286, 293 (1990) (explaining that\narguments not presented in proceedings below with sufficient particularity are waived).\n                                                 11\n\fperpetrator\u2019s distinctive body movements and unique eyes were immediately recognizable.\n\nBrittany Blaisdell testified that she had been in a three-and-a-half-year relationship with defendant\n\neight years prior, that she could identify defendant because of the distinctive way he carried\n\nhimself, and that she recognized his eyes because they were \u201cvery distinctive. Our daughter has\n\nhis eyes, so I see them all the time.\u201d This testimony, along with the surveillance videos admitted\n\ninto evidence, fairly and sufficiently supports a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the\n\nidentity element.\n\n       \u00b6 26.   Defendant next contends that the State proffered insufficient evidence to convict\n\nhim of the physical-menace element on the lesser-included charge. He asserts that the court\u2019s\n\ninstruction on the physical-menace element\u2014that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband\u201d\u2014is insufficient without further clarity to sustain a guilty\n\nverdict without a finding that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the robbery.\n\n       \u00b6 27.   We conclude that the instruction was accurate and consistent such that the jury\n\ncould acquit on assault and robbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), but nonetheless\n\nfind defendant guilty on the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery. The employees testified\n\nthat defendant lifted up his shirt and/or \u201cmoved his jacket\u201d to show what they took to be \u201cthe butt\n\nof a gun\u201d or the handle of a gun, and that they were afraid. Based on this testimony, the State\n\nproffered sufficient evidence to prove that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to place [the\n\nservice-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them the weapon\n\nconcealed in his waistband.\u201d While possessing a dangerous weapon is an essential element to\n\nconvict under \u00a7 608(b), the jury could find that defendant did not possess a \u201creal gun capable of\n\nbodily injury,\u201d but \u201cthat defendant displayed what appeared to be a real gun which placed the\n\ncomplainant in fear of serious bodily injury.\u201d State v. Stone, No. 2010-346, 2011 WL 4984009,\n\nat *1 (Vt. June 1, 2011) (unpub. mem.) [https://perma.cc/PC3D-4ERG]. The employees testified\n\n                                                 12\n\fthat defendant \u201cshowed\u201d them what they understood to be a gun, that it appeared to be partially\n\nconcealed in his waistband, and that they were afraid he would \u201cpull it on\u201d them. The State, as\n\ndefense counsel agreed, did not need to prove that defendant was actually armed with a dangerous\n\nweapon at the time he robbed the service station to prevail on the lesser-included charge.\n\nDefendant has failed to demonstrate error here.\n\n                                    IV. Vindictive Sentencing\n\n       \u00b6 28.   Defendant\u2019s final contention is that the court improperly punished him with a\n\nharsher sentence because he maintained his innocence and exercised his right to trial rather than\n\nplead prior to trial. This argument is without merit.\n\n       \u00b6 29.   Punishing a defendant for exercising their right to trial \u201cis a due process violation\n\nof the most basic sort.\u201d State v. Hughs, 2018 VT 74, \u00b6 12, 208 Vt. 44, 194 A.3d 1181 (quotation\n\nomitted). \u201cThis principle is so fundamental to our legal system that even the perception\u2014if not\n\nthe actuality of its abrogation should be avoided to prevent lasting damage to the public\u2019s\n\nperception of the inherent fairness of the criminal justice system.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 30.   When faced with an allegation of a vindictive sentence, we review the totality of\n\nthe record to determine whether to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. \u00b6 14. In doing so, we\n\ncompare the imposed sentence with both the statutory maximum and the sentence recommended\n\nby the State, determine whether the \u201cvast majority of the trial court\u2019s sentencing remarks focused\n\non legitimate sentencing considerations,\u201d and consider the context of the challenged comments.\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (quotation omitted). Ultimately, we will affirm a sentence \u201c[a]bsent exceptional\n\ncircumstances, [and] defer to the court\u2019s judgment so long as the sentence is within the statutory\n\nlimits and was not based on improper or inaccurate information.\u201d State v. Lumumba, 2014 VT\n\n85, \u00b6 22, 197 Vt. 315, 104 A.3d 627 (quotation omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 31.   Under the first factor, the court imposed a sentence of ten-to-fifteen years to serve,\n\nwhich was less than the maximum\u2014life imprisonment under the habitual-offender enhancement\u2014\n\n                                                  13\n\fand less than the ten-to-twenty-five years the State recommended. Defendant contends that the\n\ncourt gave the State \u201cthe benefit\u201d of a twenty-five-year sentence when it imposed the sentence\n\nconsecutive to defendant\u2019s currently imposed sentence for an unrelated conviction, which has a\n\nmaximum release date in 2032. However, the State was clear that its request was for ten-to-twenty-\n\nfive years to serve imposed consecutively to defendant\u2019s current sentence. Accordingly, we see\n\nno indication that the trial court intended to penalize defendant for exercising his right to trial by\n\nimposing a sentence out of proportion to the maximum penalty or to the State\u2019s recommendation.\n\nSee Hughs, 2018 VT 74, \u00b6 17.\n\n       \u00b6 32.   As to the second factor, the vast majority of the court\u2019s sentencing statements were\n\nfocused on legitimate sentencing matters. The court noted the factors it was required to consider,\n\nexpressly declined to comment on defendant\u2019s refusal to accept a plea offer, and observed that the\n\npresentencing investigation demonstrated that defendant was not taking responsibility for the\n\nconvictions. The court did opine that \u201cfolks who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result\n\nbecause they\u2019ve accepted responsibility.\u201d However, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\n\nfor the offense, and a sincere demonstration of remorse, are proper considerations in sentencing.\u201d\n\nState v. Sims, 158 Vt. 173, 188-89, 608 A.2d 1149, 1158 (1991) (explaining that such actions are\n\nimportant steps toward rehabilitation). The court\u2019s pretrial statements concerning the status of the\n\nplea negotiations, and characterizations of the plea offer itself, while not best practice, similarly\n\nrelated to whether defendant was willing to accept responsibility in light of the possibility of life\n\nimprisonment.6\n\n       \u00b6 33.   Under the third factor, the court\u2019s challenged comments occurred in the context of\n\ndefendant\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility. Defendant maintained his innocence and exercised\n\n\n\n       6\n         While defendant recounts the court\u2019s pretrial statements in his statement of facts, he does\nnot expressly argue that those statements contributed to the court\u2019s sentencing decision. However,\nwe discuss them in the interest of canvassing the entire record.\n                                                 14\n\fhis right to trial, called the convictions \u201cbullshit\u201d in the presentencing investigation, and did not\n\napologize, express remorse, or make any other statement indicating acceptance of responsibility at\n\nsentencing. Defendant was well within his rights to conduct himself in this way, and the court\n\ncould accordingly take that conduct into account as representative of his failure to take\n\nresponsibility for the convictions, and to fashion an appropriate sentence.

CARROLL, J.         Defendant Jason Bockus appeals a judgment of conviction for\n\nassault and robbery following a jury trial. He contends that the trial court erred in not suppressing\n\nout-of-court noneyewitness identifications and denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant also argues that the court impermissibly punished him with a harsher sentence for\n\nexercising his right to go to trial. We affirm.\n\n                                           I. Background\n\n        \u00b6 2.   The following is adduced from testimony and exhibits admitted at trial, and from\n\nfacts found by the trial court in its order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress out-of-court\n\nidentifications. In early December 2020, a man entered an Irving service station in Highgate,\n\fVermont just before 11 p.m. Multiple surveillance cameras showed the man wearing a hoodie,\n\nbeanie, and mask that obscured most, but not all of, his face. The man told the two service-station\n\nemployees on duty that he had a gun and ordered them to open the cash drawer. One of the\n\nattendants opened the drawer. The man took $190 and left. Neither attendant could identify the\n\nman.\n\n        \u00b6 3.     Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Baker led the investigation into the\n\nrobbery. She posted stills of the suspect taken from the surveillance footage to the Vermont State\n\nPolice Facebook page. A local resident, Christopher Uzell, responded to the posting and told\n\nDetective Baker that defendant resembled the suspect. He informed Detective Baker that he had\n\nknown defendant for about twenty years and recognized defendant\u2019s distinctive eyes. In addition\n\nto using the surveillance footage to obtain further positive identifications from defendant\u2019s\n\nprobation officer, Greg Machia, and the manager of a sober house where defendant had once lived,\n\nHarley LaRocque, Detective Baker questioned several members of defendant\u2019s family to confirm\n\nthe identity of the perpetrator.\n\n        \u00b6 4.     Detective Baker interviewed each family member individually and used the same\n\nprocedure with each person. She told them that she was investigating the robbery at the Irving\n\nstation in Highgate and asked to show them surveillance footage and stills of the footage to see if\n\nthey recognized the perpetrator. Detective Baker first played surveillance footage, then showed\n\nstills from the footage, and then, following the person\u2019s identification of defendant, showed a\n\nmugshot and a Facebook photograph from defendant\u2019s personal account to confirm that they were\n\ntalking about the same person. She did not tell them that she suspected defendant of committing\n\nthe crime depicted in the presentation materials, and she provided no commentary while they\n\nwatched the footage.1 Ultimately, defendant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, TJ and Chantell Bockus,\n\n\n\n        1\n            There was no audio recording of the incident.\n                                                  2\n\fdefendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, Brittany Blaisdell, and Blaisdell\u2019s mother, Deena\n\nRaymond, all identified defendant as the suspect. Each person expressed their belief that defendant\n\nwas the perpetrator because the person in the video had defendant\u2019s same distinctive body\n\nmovements and unique eyes, among other characteristics. Some family members informed one\n\nanother that they believed defendant \u201cmight\u201d be the person depicted in the footage prior to\n\nDetective Baker\u2019s questioning. For various reasons, each family member expressed fear that\n\ndefendant could retaliate if he learned that they had identified him, and frustration with \u201cthe\n\nsystem\u201d in which defendant had been involved for years.\n\n       \u00b6 5.      Based on the above, the State charged defendant with one count of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), and with being a habitual offender with three\n\nprior felony convictions, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 11, which carried the possibility of life imprisonment.\n\n       \u00b6 6.      Defendant moved to suppress the out-of-court identifications made by Chantell and\n\nTJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena Raymond under Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution.\n\nHe contended that Detective Baker had used an unduly suggestive comparison lineup to obtain the\n\nidentifications, and because the noneyewitnesses knew others had already identified defendant\n\nbefore viewing the presentation themselves, their own identifications were tainted by confirmation\n\nbias. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Detective\n\nBaker had not used unnecessarily suggestive investigation techniques, that suggestive\n\ncircumstances not created by law enforcement are \u201cirrelevant\u201d under State v. Porter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2716451\"><a href=\"/opinion/2716451/state-v-porter-jr/\">2014 VT 89</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2716451\"><a href=\"/opinion/2716451/state-v-porter-jr/\">197 Vt. 330</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">103 A.3d 916</span><pre class=\"inline\">, and that even if the circumstances were suggestive, the identifications\n\nwere reliable.\n\n       \u00b6 7.      At trial, Uzell, Machia, LaRocque, the Bockuses, and Blaisdell testified for the\n\nState. Uzell testified that he was eighty-percent sure of his identification, Machia said that he was\n\nmore than \u201cninety-nine-point nine percent sure,\u201d and LaRocque averred that he was a \u201cseven or\n\neight\u201d on a scale of one to ten about his identification. Chantell and TJ Bockus, and Brittany\n\n                                                 3\n\fBlaisdell each testified that they were convinced that defendant was the perpetrator. The State\n\nalso called Lynn Knight, with whom defendant had been living at the time of the robbery. Knight\n\ntestified that she was initially seventy-five percent sure that defendant was the perpetrator, but later\n\ndisclaimed her identification.\n\n       \u00b6 8.    At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal.\n\nDefendant argued that the State had failed to proffer sufficient evidence proving beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that he was the robber because it relied exclusively on out-of-court identifications\n\nby noneyewitnesses, many of whom harbored biases and \u201cagendas\u201d against defendant. He also\n\ncontended that the State failed to prove that the perpetrator had been carrying a deadly weapon\n\nduring the robbery. Taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the State, and excluding\n\nmodifying evidence, the court found that the State\u2019s witnesses had credibly testified that defendant\n\nwas the suspect in the surveillance footage, and the service-station employees had credibly testified\n\nthat it appeared to them that the man had been carrying a handgun.\n\n       \u00b6 9.    At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on the elements of assault and\n\nrobbery with a deadly weapon as follows:\n\n               (1) [defendant]; (2) [a]ttempted to put . . . gas station store\n               clerks . . . in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; (3) [h]e did so\n               by using physical menace; (4) [h]e also took money or other\n               property . . . (5) [h]e took the money or other property with the\n               intent to deprive [the gas station] of it permanently; and (6) [a]t the\n               time, he was armed with a dangerous weapon.\n\nThe court clarified that: \u201cphysical menace means a threat by word or act to inflict physical injury\n\nupon another person\u201d and that \u201cthe State alleges that Mr. Bockus attempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband.\u201d The State requested an instruction on the lesser-included\n\ncharge of assault and robbery. Without objection, the court instructed the jury that the first five\n\nelements of assault and robbery were \u201cdefined in the same way as they are defined for assault and\n\n\n                                                   4\n\frobbery with a deadly weapon,\u201d except that \u201c[t]he State need not have proven that Mr. Bockus[]\n\nwas armed with a dangerous weapon at the time.\u201d\n\n       \u00b6 10.   The jury found defendant not guilty of assault and robbery with a deadly weapon.\n\nIt found him guilty of the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery, and of being a habitual\n\noffender. At sentencing, the State recommended ten-to-twenty-five-years to serve. Defendant\n\nrequested a sentence of two-and-a-half-to-five-years to serve. The court ultimately sentenced\n\ndefendant ten-to-fifteen-years to serve, opining:\n\n               So even though the weight of the evidence was perhaps not\n               overwhelming, it was compelling, and the jurors certainly found that\n               it was. And while the Court can\u2019t comment on someone\u2019s\n               willingness and ability and right to go to trial, the fact is that folks\n               who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result because\n               they\u2019ve accepted responsibility. And Mr. Bockus certainly has not\n               accepted responsibility, which leads the Court to believe that the\n               programming part of this, to the extent that it exists, is probably not\n               going to be helpful for him because he\u2019s not at that point. I don\u2019t\n               even think he\u2019s, what they call, pre-contemplative at this point in\n               regards to his willingness to make changes in his life.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n       \u00b6 11.   Defendant advances several arguments on appeal. He argues that the court erred in\n\nnot suppressing the identifications made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond because Detective Baker used unnecessarily suggestive means to obtain the\n\nidentifications. Specifically, he contends that Detective Baker\u2019s decision to interview \u201cestranged\n\nfamily members\u201d was unnecessarily suggestive, as was her failure to ask the witnesses not to\n\ndiscuss their own identifications with each other. He argues that the identifications are also\n\nunreliable and should have been suppressed. Defendant asserts that the court improperly relied on\n\nState v. Porter for the proposition that suggestibility is irrelevant where the challenged\n\ncircumstances are not arranged by law enforcement. Defendant further contends that the court\n\nerred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and deprived him of due process by imposing\n\nan impermissibly harsh sentence because he exercised his right to trial.\n\n                                                    5\n\f       \u00b6 12.   We hold that the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We\n\nagree with the trial court that the identifications of defendant were not made under unduly\n\nsuggestive circumstances.      Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether the\n\nidentifications were reliable for purposes of defendant\u2019s due process rights, nor do we decide\n\nwhether we review purportedly suggestive out-of-court identifications not arranged by police\n\nunder Article 10. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nand detect no vindictiveness toward defendant from the trial court that would justify disturbing the\n\nsentence it imposed.\n\n                          II. Out-of-Court Noneyewitness Identifications\n\n       \u00b6 13.   We turn first to the question of whether the trial court should have suppressed the\n\nidentifications of defendant made by Chantell and TJ Bockus, Brittany Blaisdell, and Deena\n\nRaymond. We review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions in an order denying a motion to suppress\n\nwithout deference and defer to its factual findings absent clear error. State v.

The Court applies the\n\ntwo-part test first set forth in Manson v.

Mayo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057381/state-v-mayo/\">2008 VT 2</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 18,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057381/state-v-mayo/\">183 Vt. 113</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">945 A.2d 846</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quotation omitted).

In determining whether an out-of-court identification was obtained under\n\nunnecessarily suggestive circumstances, in addition to considering the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we concentrate on the form of the presentation used by police. Mayo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057381/state-v-mayo/\">2008 VT 2</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\u00b6 17.

The trial court found that each person spontaneously identified defendant only after\n\nwatching the surveillance footage without commentary from Detective Baker. Detective Baker\n\ndid not disclose defendant\u2019s name until after each person made a positive identification, at which\n\npoint she produced a photo of defendant to ensure that they were speaking about the same person.\n\nWe conclude that this procedure was not unduly suggestive. The form of Detective Baker\u2019s\n\npresentation is not like our prior cases involving suggestive methods where an eyewitness was\n\nshown a display of multiple photos of the defendant in a single array, Kasper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2363912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2363912/state-v-kasper/\">137 Vt. at 192</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2363912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2363912/state-v-kasper/\">404\n\nA.2d at 90</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a presentation consisting solely of one photo of the defendant was shown to an\n\neyewitness, State v.

Discola, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 VT 7</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 28. In contrast to the identification procedures used in those\n\ncases, Detective Baker did not show unmasked depictions of defendant until after each\n\nnoneyewitness viewed the surveillance footage and identified defendant of their own accord. See\n\nState v. Bissonette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479442/state-v-bissonette/\">145 Vt. 381</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386-87, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479442/state-v-bissonette/\">488 A.2d 1231</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1234 (1985) (holding procedure not\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fsuggestive where police showed eyewitness twenty-seven photographs one-by-one and made no\n\nsuggestions \u201cemphasizing one photograph over another\u201d).\n\n        \u00b6 17.   Moreover, because neither of the store employees could identify the perpetrator, it\n\nwas reasonable for Detective Baker to seek out family members who might be in a position to\n\nidentify him. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">130 N.E.3d 174</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (Mass. 2019) (holding that\n\npolice had \u201cgood reason\u201d to have victim\u2019s family members attempt to identify person in\n\nsurveillance footage where no eyewitnesses could do so). The totality of the circumstances in this\n\ncase\u2014including the nature of the surveillance footage, the tip Detective Baker received about the\n\npossible identity of the perpetrator, her choice to ask family members of defendant to identify the\n\nperpetrator via surveillance footage to confirm the tip, and the method she used to obtain the\n\nidentifications\u2014does not give rise to the danger of \u201cirreparable mistaken identification.\u201d\n\nBissonette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479442/state-v-bissonette/\">145 Vt. at 385</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479442/state-v-bissonette/\">488 A.2d at 1233</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n        \u00b6 18.   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reached the same conclusion on similar\n\nfacts in Commonwealth v. Vasquez. There, surveillance cameras recorded audio and visual\n\ndepictions of a man shooting and killing a woman in a parked car. There were no \u201cpercipient\u201d\n\neyewitnesses to the shooting. 130 N.E.3d at 186. Police questioned members of the victim\u2019s\n\nfamily who, before arriving at the police station, had spoken to one another and surmised that the\n\nvictim had been involved in a shooting and that the defendant was the likely perpetrator.\n\nInterviewing the witnesses separately, police presented each witness, in order, a photograph of the\n\ndefendant, an audio recording of the incident, and surveillance footage. Police did not suggest the\n\ndefendant\u2019s involvement and provided no \u201cconfirmatory feedback\u201d to the witnesses. Id. at 185\n\nn.16.   The Massachusetts high court reasoned that the form of the presentation was not\n\nunnecessarily suggestive because, without eyewitnesses who could identify the perpetrator, police\n\nhad good reason to believe that the victim\u2019s family members were in a position to identify the\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fshooter from the surveillance footage, police presented the identification materials separately, and\n\nthey did not include the audio or visual depiction of the gunshot.2 Id. at 186.\n\n       \u00b6 19.   We are also unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that Detective Baker\u2019s failure to\n\nask the witnesses to not speak with one another amounted to undue suggestiveness. The court\n\nfound Detective Baker\u2019s testimony credible regarding the identification procedure she used and\n\nfound the witnesses\u2019 testimony credible regarding their own identifications. The court found that\n\neach credibly \u201ctestified that they independently identified [defendant] based off the video\n\nsurveillance footage,\u201d and that any biases and knowledge that others had already identified\n\ndefendant \u201chad minimal influence\u201d on their own identifications.3 Based on the court\u2019s findings,\n\nwe conclude that the challenged identifications were not tainted by confirmation bias or animosity\n\ntoward defendant, and therefore were not spoiled by undue suggestiveness.

We concur, however, with the Massachusetts high court that \u201cit was not ideal that,\n\nprior to making an identification, each witness was apparently aware that the victim had been killed\n\nand suspected the defendant\u2019s involvement.\u201d Vasquez, 130 N.E.3d at 185 n.16. And we agree\n\nthat, where feasible to do so, police should direct witnesses not to speak about their perceptions\n\nwith other witnesses prior to the identification proceedings. See id. Law enforcement \u201ccannot be\n\nexpected to prevent every conceivable exposure to external information,\u201d but should \u201cguard\n\nagainst the risk that a witness may be influenced by his or her conversations with . . . family\n\nmembers . . . before making an identification.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n       2\n          We note that police in Vazquez showed each witness a photograph of the defendant\nbefore playing the audio and visual recordings, which was not done here.\n       3\n          While these findings appear in the court\u2019s reliability analysis, they clearly apply to\nDetective Baker\u2019s methodology, which the court itself noted.\n                                              9\n\f       \u00b6 21.   While not ideal, the mere fact that the witnesses, prior to their own identifications,\n\nwere aware that others had potentially identified defendant in the surveillance footage does not\n\nalone render the identifications suggestive. We emphasize that each case involving out-of-court\n\nidentifications is dependent on its own unique circumstances, and our holding is accordingly\n\nnarrow.

Defendant next takes issue with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that where police do\n\nnot arrange the suggestive circumstances, under State v. Porter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2014 VT 89</span><pre class=\"inline\">, Article 10 does not\n\napply to out-of-court identifications.

Judgment of Acquittal\n\n       \u00b6 23.   Defendant argues that the court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal. In effect, defendant contends that noneyewitnesses are insufficient to prove the identity\n\nelement where there is no physical evidence linking a defendant to a crime. He also argues that,\n\nas instructed, the jury could not have found defendant guilty of the lesser-included charge because\n\nthe State did not put on sufficient evidence to prove that defendant used physical menace to commit\n\nthe crime.\n\n       \u00b6 24.

At trial, the State put on three nonfamily members\u2014Uzell, Machia, and\n\nLaRocque\u2014who testified that they were somewhere between seventy-percent sure and ninety-\n\nnine percent sure of defendant\u2019s identity based on the surveillance footage. Uzell and Machia\n\ntestified that they had known defendant for decades, and LaRocque had managed the group home\n\nwhere defendant lived in the months before the robbery.

Our daughter has\n\nhis eyes, so I see them all the time.\u201d This testimony, along with the surveillance videos admitted\n\ninto evidence, fairly and sufficiently supports a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the\n\nidentity element.\n\n       \u00b6 26.   Defendant next contends that the State proffered insufficient evidence to convict\n\nhim of the physical-menace element on the lesser-included charge. He asserts that the court\u2019s\n\ninstruction on the physical-menace element\u2014that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to\n\nplace [the service-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them\n\nthe weapon concealed in his waistband\u201d\u2014is insufficient without further clarity to sustain a guilty\n\nverdict without a finding that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the robbery.\n\n       \u00b6 27.   We conclude that the instruction was accurate and consistent such that the jury\n\ncould acquit on assault and robbery with a deadly weapon, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 608(b), but nonetheless\n\nfind defendant guilty on the lesser-included charge of assault and robbery. The employees testified\n\nthat defendant lifted up his shirt and/or \u201cmoved his jacket\u201d to show what they took to be \u201cthe butt\n\nof a gun\u201d or the handle of a gun, and that they were afraid. Based on this testimony, the State\n\nproffered sufficient evidence to prove that defendant \u201cattempted by physical menace to place [the\n\nservice-station employees] in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, by showing them the weapon\n\nconcealed in his waistband.\u201d While possessing a dangerous weapon is an essential element to\n\nconvict under \u00a7 608(b), the jury could find that defendant did not possess a \u201creal gun capable of\n\nbodily injury,\u201d but \u201cthat defendant displayed what appeared to be a real gun which placed the\n\ncomplainant in fear of serious bodily injury.\u201d State v.

The State, as\n\ndefense counsel agreed, did not need to prove that defendant was actually armed with a dangerous\n\nweapon at the time he robbed the service station to prevail on the lesser-included charge.\n\nDefendant has failed to demonstrate error here.\n\n                                    IV. Vindictive Sentencing\n\n       \u00b6 28.   Defendant\u2019s final contention is that the court improperly punished him with a\n\nharsher sentence because he maintained his innocence and exercised his right to trial rather than\n\nplead prior to trial. This argument is without merit.\n\n       \u00b6 29.   Punishing a defendant for exercising their right to trial \u201cis a due process violation\n\nof the most basic sort.\u201d State v.

Under the first factor, the court imposed a sentence of ten-to-fifteen years to serve,\n\nwhich was less than the maximum\u2014life imprisonment under the habitual-offender enhancement\u2014\n\n                                                  13\n\fand less than the ten-to-twenty-five years the State recommended. Defendant contends that the\n\ncourt gave the State \u201cthe benefit\u201d of a twenty-five-year sentence when it imposed the sentence\n\nconsecutive to defendant\u2019s currently imposed sentence for an unrelated conviction, which has a\n\nmaximum release date in 2032. However, the State was clear that its request was for ten-to-twenty-\n\nfive years to serve imposed consecutively to defendant\u2019s current sentence. Accordingly, we see\n\nno indication that the trial court intended to penalize defendant for exercising his right to trial by\n\nimposing a sentence out of proportion to the maximum penalty or to the State\u2019s recommendation.\n\nSee Hughs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 VT 74</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 17.\n\n       \u00b6 32.   As to the second factor, the vast majority of the court\u2019s sentencing statements were\n\nfocused on legitimate sentencing matters. The court noted the factors it was required to consider,\n\nexpressly declined to comment on defendant\u2019s refusal to accept a plea offer, and observed that the\n\npresentencing investigation demonstrated that defendant was not taking responsibility for the\n\nconvictions. The court did opine that \u201cfolks who enter pleas prior to trial tend to get a better result\n\nbecause they\u2019ve accepted responsibility.\u201d However, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\n\nfor the offense, and a sincere demonstration of remorse, are proper considerations in sentencing.\u201d\n\nState v.

Under the third factor, the court\u2019s challenged comments occurred in the context of\n\ndefendant\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility.

However,\nwe discuss them in the interest of canvassing the entire record.\n                                                 14\n\fhis right to trial, called the convictions \u201cbullshit\u201d in the presentencing investigation, and did not\n\napologize, express remorse, or make any other statement indicating acceptance of responsibility at\n\nsentencing. Defendant was well within his rights to conduct himself in this way, and the court\n\ncould accordingly take that conduct into account as representative of his failure to take\n\nresponsibility for the convictions, and to fashion an appropriate sentence. The court did not abuse\n\nits discretion.\n\n        \u00b6 34.

His obituary refers to intervenor\n\nas his \u201ccommon-law- wife\u201d [sic], and his death certificate names her as his spouse.\n\nThe plaintiff, Da Cruz\u2019s mother, argues that intervenor was never married to her son,\n\nand instead refers to intervenor\u2014with whom Da Cruz had three children\u2014as his\n\n\u201clive-in girlfriend.\u201d The present case stems from this dispute.\n\n                                Probate Proceedings\n\n      Born in Cape Verde, Da Cruz was a resident of Providence, Rhode Island, and\n\nworked for Brown University at the time of his death. According to plaintiff, while\n\nshe and other members of her family were making funeral arrangements, intervenor\n\n\u201cpresented herself to the funeral home\u201d and \u201cchanged [Da Cruz\u2019s] death certificate\n\nunder false pretenses.\u201d The funeral home published Da Cruz\u2019s obituary on May 5,\n\n2008, and described intervenor therein as his common-law wife.\n\n      Two days later, on May 7, 2008, the funeral home filed Da Cruz\u2019s death\n\ncertificate, which lists intervenor as not only his spouse but also the informant.3 In\n\n\n\n2\n  The last name \u201cDa Cruz\u201d appears in the record either with or without a space. We\nuse the iteration that appears on his death certificate and citizenship documents. No\ndisrespect is intended.\n3\n  An informant is someone who provides the funeral director, or another person\nauthorized to file a death certificate, with personal data about the decedent. See G.L.\n1956 \u00a7 23-3-16(b).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fher prebriefing statement, plaintiff implies that these details of the death certificate\n\nwere unknown to her until proceedings commenced in the Providence Probate Court\n\nthe following month. As for the obituary, plaintiff has claimed that she and other\n\nmembers of her family knew about and disputed the reference to intervenor as\n\nDa Cruz\u2019s common-law wife but did not seek a correction because they wanted to\n\n\u201cavoid additional family drama and distress.\u201d\n\n        In probate court, an attorney entered her appearance on plaintiff\u2019s behalf on\n\nJune 20, 2008, and plaintiff objected to the appointment of intervenor as\n\nadministratrix of Da Cruz\u2019s estate soon thereafter. According to plaintiff, intervenor\n\nnamed herself as Da Cruz\u2019s spouse in the initial administration petition.4 Litigation\n\nensued, during which plaintiff concedes in her prebriefing statement that the details\n\nof her son\u2019s death certificate \u201ccame to light.\u201d\n\n        On July 24, 2008, plaintiff and intervenor agreed to the appointment of a\n\nthird-party attorney as administrator of Da Cruz\u2019s estate. The probate court closed\n\nthe estate in 2010.\n\n        In her filings in Superior Court, plaintiff represented that she \u201cassumed that\n\nthe death certificate had been corrected\u201d during the probate proceedings but realized\n\nthis was not the case \u201cwhen she requested a new copy of her son\u2019s death certificate.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff does not state exactly when she made this request, but a copy of the\n\n\n4\n    The Providence Probate Court records are not part of the record on appeal.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdeath certificate attached to the complaint was issued on March 9, 2018. Sometime\n\nthereafter, \u201caround 2019,\u201d plaintiff sought legal advice regarding her own estate, and\n\nher legal counsel in Cape Verde advised her that Da Cruz\u2019s \u201cerroneous death\n\ncertificate would interfere with her estate planning and that she should get it\n\ncorrected as soon as practicable.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)\n\n                              First Round of Motions\n\n      On November 7, 2019, plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in Superior Court\n\nseeking to amend the death certificate. She also sent the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Health\u2019s Division of Vital Records a request to amend the death certificate that\n\nsame day.    A Superior Court summons named the Department of Health as\n\ndefendant, and the Department filed an answer stating that it lacked \u201cknowledge or\n\ninformation sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d Then,\n\non December 16, 2019, Costa filed a motion to intervene, which the Superior Court\n\ngranted.\n\n      The intervenor also filed motions to dismiss and for judgment on the\n\npleadings.   In the latter motion, intervenor argued that the limitations period\n\napplicable to plaintiff\u2019s claim, codified at G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-1-13(a), had expired.\n\nSection 9-1-13(a) states that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specially provided, all civil\n\nactions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall\n\naccrue, and not after.\u201d According to intervenor, the complaint and attachments\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f\u201cma[d]e it clear\u201d that plaintiff knew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named\n\nCosta as his spouse; therefore, she no longer had a viable cause of action in 2019\n\nwhen she filed the complaint.\n\n       In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings, plaintiff\u2014now represented by an attorney\u2014made two arguments\n\nregarding the statute of limitations. Her principal argument was that \u201c\u00a7 9-1-13 [did]\n\nnot apply * * * because [hers was] not a products liability complaint,\u201d nor, for that\n\nmatter, one of negligence, which was the type of case intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nIn the alternative, plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations was tolled until 2019,\n\nwhen she sought legal advice regarding her estate, because only then did she\n\ndiscover that her son\u2019s unamended death certificate might affect her estate planning\n\nin Cape Verde. As support, plaintiff cited Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291 (R.I.\n\n2001), in which this Court held that, \u201c[i]n some \u2018narrowly circumscribed factual\n\nsituations,\u2019 * * * when the fact of the injury is unknown to the plaintiff when it\n\noccurs, the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled and will not begin to run\n\nuntil, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the plaintiff should have discovered the\n\ninjury or some injury-causing wrongful conduct.\u201d Martin, 784 A.2d at 299 (quoting\n\nRenaud v. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, 662 A.2d 711, 714 (R.I. 1995)).                  This\n\nexception is known as the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d See Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994,\n\n1005-06 (R.I. 2012).\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f      In contrast to intervenor in her motion, plaintiff discussed \u00a7 9-1-13 in her\n\nmemorandum without reference to subsection (a). In her reply, intervenor observed\n\nthat, while subsection (b) provides a special rule for the statute of limitations in\n\nproducts-liability cases, subsection (a) provides the general rule for \u201call civil\n\nactions\u201d and thus governed plaintiff\u2019s claim. She disregarded plaintiff\u2019s attempt to\n\ndistinguish her claim from the negligence cases that intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nAs for plaintiff\u2019s invocation of Martin, intervenor contended that the discovery rule\n\ndid not apply because the record indicated that, \u201cas far back as 2008,\u201d plaintiff knew\n\nor should have known that her son\u2019s death certificate referred to intervenor as his\n\nspouse and, furthermore, that this might have legal implications regarding the assets\n\nto which he was entitled.\n\n                            Second Round of Motions\n\n      The Superior Court did not render a decision on either of intervenor\u2019s 2019\n\nmotions. Almost three years later, in July 2022, intervenor filed a second set of\n\nmotions, which this time included a motion for summary judgment. Again, in her\n\nmemorandum in support of her motion for judgment on the pleadings, Costa argued\n\nthat plaintiff lacked a viable cause of action because the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations\u2014set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\u2014had expired. According to intervenor, \u201c[t]he\n\npleadings ma[d]e it clear that [plaintiff] was aware of the alleged wrongdoing and\n\nfailed to pursue it.\u201d\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f      In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion, plaintiff focused on\n\nthe discovery-rule exception and dropped the argument that \u00a7 9-1-13 did not apply.\n\nIndeed, this time she referred explicitly to \u00a7 9-1-13(a). The intervenor\u2019s reply,\n\nhowever, both invoked and refuted plaintiff\u2019s earlier argument that the statute was\n\nlimited to products-liability cases and was therefore inapplicable.\n\n                           Summary-Judgment Hearing\n\n      The parties came before the Superior Court on October 25, 2022, for a hearing\n\non intervenor\u2019s motions. The hearing justice noted that he had \u201cread everything,\u201d\n\nbut he asked the parties whether they had \u201canything to add to what [they] filed[.]\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff raised two arguments that did not appear in her memoranda. First,\n\nplaintiff revived the argument, albeit in passing, that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) is \u201ca products\n\nliability statute, and I don\u2019t think it applies * * *.\u201d Second, she argued that, even if\n\nthe statute applied, her alleged injury occurred in 2010 at the close of the probate\n\nproceedings\u2014when she assumed her son\u2019s death certificate had been corrected\u2014\n\nand not in 2008; therefore, the ten-year statute of limitations had not expired when\n\nshe filed her complaint in 2019.\n\n      Following plaintiff\u2019s arguments, the hearing justice announced his decision\n\nfrom the bench. To begin, having notified the parties the previous day of his\n\nintentions, the hearing justice converted intervenor\u2019s several motions into a single\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmotion for summary judgment. The hearing justice made this decision because the\n\nparties\u2019 filings relied on material outside the scope of the pleadings.\n\n      The hearing justice next considered intervenor\u2019s argument that plaintiff lacked\n\na viable cause of action because the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\n\nAfter finding that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applied to plaintiff\u2019s claim, the hearing justice stated\n\nthat the \u201cparties do not dispute the facts pertinent to the statute of limitations\n\nanalysis.\u201d According to the hearing justice, plaintiff did not dispute, and had even\n\nconceded, not only that she was aware of intervenor\u2019s \u201callegedly wrongful conduct\u201d\n\nin 2008, but also \u201cthat she assumed that all issues related to her son and the Death\n\nCertificate had been resolved in the Probate Court such that she did not pursue\n\ncorrection of the Death Certificate after the estate was closed.\u201d The hearing justice\n\nconcluded that the statute-of-limitations issue therefore presented a question of law,\n\nbecause there were \u201cno predicate facts to be determined by a fact finder[.]\u201d\n\n      From there, the hearing justice examined plaintiff\u2019s contention that her claim\n\nwarranted an exception to the statute of limitations under the discovery rule; he\n\nconcluded that it did not. \u201c[T]he first problem,\u201d he explained, was that plaintiff\n\nknew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named intervenor as his spouse, which\n\na reasonable person should have known could affect the administration of her son\u2019s\n\nestate and her estate as well. The hearing justice also noted that plaintiff \u201cwas\n\ndirectly involved in the probate proceedings * * * and sought to establish that\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f[i]ntervenor was not legally married to [Da Cruz] to prevent [i]ntervenor from\n\nbecoming a beneficiary of [his] estate.\u201d According to the hearing justice, this made\n\nunreasonable her assumption that the proceedings resolved all issues concerning her\n\nson\u2019s death certificate, thus undercutting the second argument that she made at the\n\nhearing but not in her memoranda. Finally, the hearing justice noted that \u201cthe Rhode\n\nIsland Probate Court is not vested with the jurisdiction to declare legal relations\n\nbetween individuals,\u201d thereby making plaintiff\u2019s assumption even less reasonable.\n\n(Citing G.L. 1956 \u00a7 8-9-9.) In the exercise of reasonable diligence, the hearing\n\njustice concluded, plaintiff should have discovered her alleged injury in 2008, and\n\nso the statute of limitations had not been tolled. He therefore granted intervenor\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n        The Superior Court entered final judgment in favor of intervenor on December\n\n1, 2022. The plaintiff filed a premature but valid notice of appeal on November 21,\n\n2022.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n        \u201cThis Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,\n\nemploying the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.\u201d Apex\n\nDevelopment Company, LLC v. Rhode Island Department of Transportation, 291\n\nA.3d 995, 998 (R.I. 2023) (quoting Nelson v. Allstate Insurance Company, 228 A.3d\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f983, 984-85 (R.I. 2020)). \u201cWe will affirm a trial court\u2019s decision only if, after\n\nreviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id. (quoting Nelson, 228 A.3d at\n\n985). \u201cFurthermore, the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent\n\nevidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere\n\nallegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.\u201d Id.\n\n(quoting Nelson, 228 A.3d at 985).\n\n                                           III\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n      The plaintiff raises only one argument on appeal. As before, she contends that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) does not apply, but now her argument is that, although \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\nprovides a general rule for \u201call civil actions,\u201d the complaint she filed in Superior\n\nCourt is not a civil action. The plaintiff points instead to a different statute, codified\n\nat G.L. 1956 \u00a7 23-3-21, which governs the correction and amendment of vital\n\nrecords. According to plaintiff, this separate statute controls her claim, and because\n\nit does not provide for a limitations period, the filing of her complaint was never\n\ntime constrained. Because plaintiff did not raise this argument in Superior Court,\n\nhowever, it has not been preserved for appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\f      \u201cAccording to this Court\u2019s well settled raise-or-waive rule, issues not properly\n\npresented before the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d\n\nDonnelly Real Estate, LLC v. John Crane Inc., 291 A.3d 987, 994 (R.I. 2023)\n\n(quoting Borgo v. Narragansett Electric Company, 275 A.3d 567, 576-77 (R.I.\n\n2022)).   Here, plaintiff\u2019s specific argument on appeal regarding the statute\u2019s\n\napplication is not the argument she made in Superior Court. In other words, plaintiff\n\n\u201cadvance[d] a new theory on appeal [that] was not raised before the trial court.\u201d State\n\nv. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). She has therefore waived this argument\n\non appeal.\n\n      Even if plaintiff had not waived this argument, however, we would hold that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies to her claim. Section 23-3-21 governs the correction of vital\n\nrecords, which plaintiff has sought with respect to her son\u2019s death certificate.\n\nAlthough the statute lacks a discrete limitations period for making requests to amend\n\nvital records, the State Registrar for Vital Records may not grant certain requests\n\nwithout a court order. See \u00a7 23-3-21.5 The plaintiff concedes that hers is one such\n\nrequest. Nonetheless, she argues that \u201c\u00a7 23-3-21 is a bureaucratic mistake correction\n\nstatute and cannot be controlled by any statute of limitations[,]\u201d and therefore it does\n\nnot matter when she filed her complaint in Superior Court.\n\n\n\n5\n  Regulations provide that the State Registrar for Vital Records has the sole power\nto amend vital records. 216 RICR 10-10-1.37(A).\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f      In certain cases, \u00a7 23-3-21 might operate to correct \u201cbureaucratic mistake[s],\u201d\n\nsuch as transcription errors, misspellings, and the like. The plaintiff\u2019s case, however,\n\nis not one of them. At the heart of plaintiff\u2019s request to correct her son\u2019s death\n\ncertificate is not some minor typographical error, but rather an allegation of fraud,\n\nwhich the state registrar, as a \u201cministerial officer, possessing limited discretion,\u201d\n\nlacks power to adjudicate. Souza v. O\u2019Hara, 121 R.I. 88, 92, 395 A.2d 1060, 1062\n\n(1978). Furthermore, intervenor has a clear interest in the subject of plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncomplaint, that is, whether she is recognized by this state as the surviving spouse of\n\nOrlando A. Da Cruz. Were the state to grant plaintiff the relief she seeks, this would\n\nhave significant implications for intervenor\u2019s legal rights and obligations, to say\n\nnothing of dignitary or emotional harm. Indeed, this is what enabled her to intervene\n\nin this matter to begin with. See Super. R. Civ. P. 24(a).\n\n      It may just be that not all requests to amend vital records are subject to a statute\n\nof limitations, but then again, not all requests to amend vital records require the\n\napplicant to commence a civil action. In 1910, this Court defined \u201c[t]he term \u2018civil\n\naction,\u2019 as used in statutes,\u201d to mean \u201ca proceeding in a court of justice by one party\n\nagainst another for the enforcement or protection of a private right or the redress of\n\na private wrong.\u201d Thrift v. Thrift, 30 R.I. 357, 363, 75 A. 484, 487 (1910). More\n\nrecently, we defined \u201ccivil action,\u201d in the context of another statute, as a \u201cjudicial\n\nproceeding which is commenced by the filing of a complaint and all other required\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fdocuments together with the fees prescribed by law.\u201d Johnson v. Johnson, 264 A.3d\n\n835, 839 (R.I. 2021); see also Super. R. Civ. P. 2 (\u201cThere shall be one (1) form of\n\naction to be known as \u2018civil action.\u2019\u201d). According to either definition, the plaintiff\n\ncommenced a civil action when she filed her complaint in Superior Court to amend\n\nher son\u2019s death certificate. Because the statute of limitations under \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\napplies to \u201call civil actions\u201d unless otherwise provided, and because the legislature\n\nhas not enacted a special rule for requests to amend vital records, \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies\n\nto the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Consequently, we concur with the hearing justice that the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a).\n\n                                           IV\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.\n\nThe papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court.\n\n\n\n      Justice Long did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                          STATE OF RHODE ISLAND\n                                     SUPREME COURT \u2013 CLERK\u2019S OFFICE\n                                           Licht Judicial Complex\n                                             250 Benefit Street\n                                           Providence, RI 02903\n\n\n                                 OPINION COVER SHEET\n\n\nTitle of Case                        In re Orlando A.

The plaintiff, Clara Martins, appeals\n\nfrom a Superior Court judgment in favor of the intervenor, Isabel DaPina Costa,1\n\nfollowing the grant of the intervenor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This case\n\ncame before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear\n\nand show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily\n\ndecided. After considering the parties\u2019 written and oral submissions and reviewing\n\nthe record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be\n\ndecided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Multiple spellings of the intervenor\u2019s name appear in the record. We use the\niteration that appears in the motion to intervene. No disrespect is intended.\n\n                                       -1-\n\f                                          I\n\n                                  Facts and Travel\n\n      Orlando A. Da Cruz2 died on May 1, 2008. His obituary refers to intervenor\n\nas his \u201ccommon-law- wife\u201d [sic], and his death certificate names her as his spouse.\n\nThe plaintiff, Da Cruz\u2019s mother, argues that intervenor was never married to her son,\n\nand instead refers to intervenor\u2014with whom Da Cruz had three children\u2014as his\n\n\u201clive-in girlfriend.\u201d The present case stems from this dispute.\n\n                                Probate Proceedings\n\n      Born in Cape Verde, Da Cruz was a resident of Providence, Rhode Island, and\n\nworked for Brown University at the time of his death. According to plaintiff, while\n\nshe and other members of her family were making funeral arrangements, intervenor\n\n\u201cpresented herself to the funeral home\u201d and \u201cchanged [Da Cruz\u2019s] death certificate\n\nunder false pretenses.\u201d The funeral home published Da Cruz\u2019s obituary on May 5,\n\n2008, and described intervenor therein as his common-law wife.\n\n      Two days later, on May 7, 2008, the funeral home filed Da Cruz\u2019s death\n\ncertificate, which lists intervenor as not only his spouse but also the informant.3 In\n\n\n\n2\n  The last name \u201cDa Cruz\u201d appears in the record either with or without a space. We\nuse the iteration that appears on his death certificate and citizenship documents. No\ndisrespect is intended.\n3\n  An informant is someone who provides the funeral director, or another person\nauthorized to file a death certificate, with personal data about the decedent. See G.L.\n1956 \u00a7 23-3-16(b).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fher prebriefing statement, plaintiff implies that these details of the death certificate\n\nwere unknown to her until proceedings commenced in the Providence Probate Court\n\nthe following month. As for the obituary, plaintiff has claimed that she and other\n\nmembers of her family knew about and disputed the reference to intervenor as\n\nDa Cruz\u2019s common-law wife but did not seek a correction because they wanted to\n\n\u201cavoid additional family drama and distress.\u201d\n\n        In probate court, an attorney entered her appearance on plaintiff\u2019s behalf on\n\nJune 20, 2008, and plaintiff objected to the appointment of intervenor as\n\nadministratrix of Da Cruz\u2019s estate soon thereafter. According to plaintiff, intervenor\n\nnamed herself as Da Cruz\u2019s spouse in the initial administration petition.4 Litigation\n\nensued, during which plaintiff concedes in her prebriefing statement that the details\n\nof her son\u2019s death certificate \u201ccame to light.\u201d\n\n        On July 24, 2008, plaintiff and intervenor agreed to the appointment of a\n\nthird-party attorney as administrator of Da Cruz\u2019s estate. The probate court closed\n\nthe estate in 2010.\n\n        In her filings in Superior Court, plaintiff represented that she \u201cassumed that\n\nthe death certificate had been corrected\u201d during the probate proceedings but realized\n\nthis was not the case \u201cwhen she requested a new copy of her son\u2019s death certificate.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff does not state exactly when she made this request, but a copy of the\n\n\n4\n    The Providence Probate Court records are not part of the record on appeal.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdeath certificate attached to the complaint was issued on March 9, 2018. Sometime\n\nthereafter, \u201caround 2019,\u201d plaintiff sought legal advice regarding her own estate, and\n\nher legal counsel in Cape Verde advised her that Da Cruz\u2019s \u201cerroneous death\n\ncertificate would interfere with her estate planning and that she should get it\n\ncorrected as soon as practicable.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)\n\n                              First Round of Motions\n\n      On November 7, 2019, plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in Superior Court\n\nseeking to amend the death certificate. She also sent the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Health\u2019s Division of Vital Records a request to amend the death certificate that\n\nsame day.    A Superior Court summons named the Department of Health as\n\ndefendant, and the Department filed an answer stating that it lacked \u201cknowledge or\n\ninformation sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d Then,\n\non December 16, 2019, Costa filed a motion to intervene, which the Superior Court\n\ngranted.\n\n      The intervenor also filed motions to dismiss and for judgment on the\n\npleadings.   In the latter motion, intervenor argued that the limitations period\n\napplicable to plaintiff\u2019s claim, codified at G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-1-13(a), had expired.\n\nSection 9-1-13(a) states that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specially provided, all civil\n\nactions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall\n\naccrue, and not after.\u201d According to intervenor, the complaint and attachments\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f\u201cma[d]e it clear\u201d that plaintiff knew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named\n\nCosta as his spouse; therefore, she no longer had a viable cause of action in 2019\n\nwhen she filed the complaint.\n\n       In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings, plaintiff\u2014now represented by an attorney\u2014made two arguments\n\nregarding the statute of limitations. Her principal argument was that \u201c\u00a7 9-1-13 [did]\n\nnot apply * * * because [hers was] not a products liability complaint,\u201d nor, for that\n\nmatter, one of negligence, which was the type of case intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nIn the alternative, plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations was tolled until 2019,\n\nwhen she sought legal advice regarding her estate, because only then did she\n\ndiscover that her son\u2019s unamended death certificate might affect her estate planning\n\nin Cape Verde. As support, plaintiff cited Martin v. Howard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318796\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318796/martin-v-howard/\">784 A.2d 291</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (R.I.\n\n2001), in which this Court held that, \u201c[i]n some \u2018narrowly circumscribed factual\n\nsituations,\u2019 * * * when the fact of the injury is unknown to the plaintiff when it\n\noccurs, the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled and will not begin to run\n\nuntil, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the plaintiff should have discovered the\n\ninjury or some injury-causing wrongful conduct.\u201d Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318796\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318796/martin-v-howard/\">784 A.2d at 299</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting\n\nRenaud v.

In her reply, intervenor observed\n\nthat, while subsection (b) provides a special rule for the statute of limitations in\n\nproducts-liability cases, subsection (a) provides the general rule for \u201call civil\n\nactions\u201d and thus governed plaintiff\u2019s claim. She disregarded plaintiff\u2019s attempt to\n\ndistinguish her claim from the negligence cases that intervenor cited in her motion.\n\nAs for plaintiff\u2019s invocation of Martin, intervenor contended that the discovery rule\n\ndid not apply because the record indicated that, \u201cas far back as 2008,\u201d plaintiff knew\n\nor should have known that her son\u2019s death certificate referred to intervenor as his\n\nspouse and, furthermore, that this might have legal implications regarding the assets\n\nto which he was entitled.\n\n                            Second Round of Motions\n\n      The Superior Court did not render a decision on either of intervenor\u2019s 2019\n\nmotions. Almost three years later, in July 2022, intervenor filed a second set of\n\nmotions, which this time included a motion for summary judgment. Again, in her\n\nmemorandum in support of her motion for judgment on the pleadings, Costa argued\n\nthat plaintiff lacked a viable cause of action because the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations\u2014set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\u2014had expired. According to intervenor, \u201c[t]he\n\npleadings ma[d]e it clear that [plaintiff] was aware of the alleged wrongdoing and\n\nfailed to pursue it.\u201d\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f      In her memorandum in opposition to intervenor\u2019s motion, plaintiff focused on\n\nthe discovery-rule exception and dropped the argument that \u00a7 9-1-13 did not apply.\n\nIndeed, this time she referred explicitly to \u00a7 9-1-13(a). The intervenor\u2019s reply,\n\nhowever, both invoked and refuted plaintiff\u2019s earlier argument that the statute was\n\nlimited to products-liability cases and was therefore inapplicable.\n\n                           Summary-Judgment Hearing\n\n      The parties came before the Superior Court on October 25, 2022, for a hearing\n\non intervenor\u2019s motions. The hearing justice noted that he had \u201cread everything,\u201d\n\nbut he asked the parties whether they had \u201canything to add to what [they] filed[.]\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff raised two arguments that did not appear in her memoranda. First,\n\nplaintiff revived the argument, albeit in passing, that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) is \u201ca products\n\nliability statute, and I don\u2019t think it applies * * *.\u201d Second, she argued that, even if\n\nthe statute applied, her alleged injury occurred in 2010 at the close of the probate\n\nproceedings\u2014when she assumed her son\u2019s death certificate had been corrected\u2014\n\nand not in 2008; therefore, the ten-year statute of limitations had not expired when\n\nshe filed her complaint in 2019.\n\n      Following plaintiff\u2019s arguments, the hearing justice announced his decision\n\nfrom the bench. To begin, having notified the parties the previous day of his\n\nintentions, the hearing justice converted intervenor\u2019s several motions into a single\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmotion for summary judgment. The hearing justice made this decision because the\n\nparties\u2019 filings relied on material outside the scope of the pleadings.\n\n      The hearing justice next considered intervenor\u2019s argument that plaintiff lacked\n\na viable cause of action because the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\n\nAfter finding that \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applied to plaintiff\u2019s claim, the hearing justice stated\n\nthat the \u201cparties do not dispute the facts pertinent to the statute of limitations\n\nanalysis.\u201d According to the hearing justice, plaintiff did not dispute, and had even\n\nconceded, not only that she was aware of intervenor\u2019s \u201callegedly wrongful conduct\u201d\n\nin 2008, but also \u201cthat she assumed that all issues related to her son and the Death\n\nCertificate had been resolved in the Probate Court such that she did not pursue\n\ncorrection of the Death Certificate after the estate was closed.\u201d The hearing justice\n\nconcluded that the statute-of-limitations issue therefore presented a question of law,\n\nbecause there were \u201cno predicate facts to be determined by a fact finder[.]\u201d\n\n      From there, the hearing justice examined plaintiff\u2019s contention that her claim\n\nwarranted an exception to the statute of limitations under the discovery rule; he\n\nconcluded that it did not. \u201c[T]he first problem,\u201d he explained, was that plaintiff\n\nknew in 2008 that her son\u2019s death certificate named intervenor as his spouse, which\n\na reasonable person should have known could affect the administration of her son\u2019s\n\nestate and her estate as well. The hearing justice also noted that plaintiff \u201cwas\n\ndirectly involved in the probate proceedings * * * and sought to establish that\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f[i]ntervenor was not legally married to [Da Cruz] to prevent [i]ntervenor from\n\nbecoming a beneficiary of [his] estate.\u201d According to the hearing justice, this made\n\nunreasonable her assumption that the proceedings resolved all issues concerning her\n\nson\u2019s death certificate, thus undercutting the second argument that she made at the\n\nhearing but not in her memoranda. Finally, the hearing justice noted that \u201cthe Rhode\n\nIsland Probate Court is not vested with the jurisdiction to declare legal relations\n\nbetween individuals,\u201d thereby making plaintiff\u2019s assumption even less reasonable.\n\n(Citing G.L. 1956 \u00a7 8-9-9.) In the exercise of reasonable diligence, the hearing\n\njustice concluded, plaintiff should have discovered her alleged injury in 2008, and\n\nso the statute of limitations had not been tolled. He therefore granted intervenor\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n        The Superior Court entered final judgment in favor of intervenor on December\n\n1, 2022. The plaintiff filed a premature but valid notice of appeal on November 21,\n\n2022.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n        \u201cThis Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,\n\nemploying the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.\u201d Apex\n\nDevelopment Company, LLC v.

As before, she contends that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) does not apply, but now her argument is that, although \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\nprovides a general rule for \u201call civil actions,\u201d the complaint she filed in Superior\n\nCourt is not a civil action. The plaintiff points instead to a different statute, codified\n\nat G.L. 1956 \u00a7 23-3-21, which governs the correction and amendment of vital\n\nrecords. According to plaintiff, this separate statute controls her claim, and because\n\nit does not provide for a limitations period, the filing of her complaint was never\n\ntime constrained. Because plaintiff did not raise this argument in Superior Court,\n\nhowever, it has not been preserved for appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\f      \u201cAccording to this Court\u2019s well settled raise-or-waive rule, issues not properly\n\npresented before the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d\n\nDonnelly Real Estate, LLC v. John Crane Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">291 A.3d 987</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 994 (R.I. 2023)\n\n(quoting Borgo v. Narragansett Electric Company, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">275 A.3d 567</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576-77 (R.I.\n\n2022)).   Here, plaintiff\u2019s specific argument on appeal regarding the statute\u2019s\n\napplication is not the argument she made in Superior Court. In other words, plaintiff\n\n\u201cadvance[d] a new theory on appeal [that] was not raised before the trial court.\u201d State\n\nv. Bido, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1966073\"><a href=\"/opinion/1966073/state-v-bido/\">941 A.2d 822</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). She has therefore waived this argument\n\non appeal.\n\n      Even if plaintiff had not waived this argument, however, we would hold that\n\n\u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies to her claim. Section 23-3-21 governs the correction of vital\n\nrecords, which plaintiff has sought with respect to her son\u2019s death certificate.\n\nAlthough the statute lacks a discrete limitations period for making requests to amend\n\nvital records, the State Registrar for Vital Records may not grant certain requests\n\nwithout a court order. See \u00a7 23-3-21.5 The plaintiff concedes that hers is one such\n\nrequest. Nonetheless, she argues that \u201c\u00a7 23-3-21 is a bureaucratic mistake correction\n\nstatute and cannot be controlled by any statute of limitations[,]\u201d and therefore it does\n\nnot matter when she filed her complaint in Superior Court.\n\n\n\n5\n  Regulations provide that the State Registrar for Vital Records has the sole power\nto amend vital records. 216 RICR 10-10-1.37(A).\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f      In certain cases, \u00a7 23-3-21 might operate to correct \u201cbureaucratic mistake[s],\u201d\n\nsuch as transcription errors, misspellings, and the like. The plaintiff\u2019s case, however,\n\nis not one of them. At the heart of plaintiff\u2019s request to correct her son\u2019s death\n\ncertificate is not some minor typographical error, but rather an allegation of fraud,\n\nwhich the state registrar, as a \u201cministerial officer, possessing limited discretion,\u201d\n\nlacks power to adjudicate.

Furthermore, intervenor has a clear interest in the subject of plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncomplaint, that is, whether she is recognized by this state as the surviving spouse of\n\nOrlando A. Da Cruz. Were the state to grant plaintiff the relief she seeks, this would\n\nhave significant implications for intervenor\u2019s legal rights and obligations, to say\n\nnothing of dignitary or emotional harm. Indeed, this is what enabled her to intervene\n\nin this matter to begin with. See Super. R. Civ. P. 24(a).\n\n      It may just be that not all requests to amend vital records are subject to a statute\n\nof limitations, but then again, not all requests to amend vital records require the\n\napplicant to commence a civil action. In 1910, this Court defined \u201c[t]he term \u2018civil\n\naction,\u2019 as used in statutes,\u201d to mean \u201ca proceeding in a court of justice by one party\n\nagainst another for the enforcement or protection of a private right or the redress of\n\na private wrong.\u201d Thrift v.

More\n\nrecently, we defined \u201ccivil action,\u201d in the context of another statute, as a \u201cjudicial\n\nproceeding which is commenced by the filing of a complaint and all other required\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fdocuments together with the fees prescribed by law.\u201d Johnson v.

According to either definition, the plaintiff\n\ncommenced a civil action when she filed her complaint in Superior Court to amend\n\nher son\u2019s death certificate. Because the statute of limitations under \u00a7 9-1-13(a)\n\napplies to \u201call civil actions\u201d unless otherwise provided, and because the legislature\n\nhas not enacted a special rule for requests to amend vital records, \u00a7 9-1-13(a) applies\n\nto the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Consequently, we concur with the hearing justice that the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 9-1-13(a).\n\n                                           IV\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.\n\nThe papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court.\n\n\n\n      Justice Long did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                          STATE OF RHODE ISLAND\n                                     SUPREME COURT \u2013 CLERK\u2019S OFFICE\n                                           Licht Judicial Complex\n                                             250 Benefit Street\n                                           Providence, RI 02903\n\n\n                                 OPINION COVER SHEET\n\n\nTitle of Case                        In re Orlando A.

Mello, Assistant District Attorney, for the\nCommonwealth.\n\n\n    WOLOHOJIAN, J.     Approximately one month before his\n\neighteenth birthday, the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent for\n\nhaving committed assault and battery on a family or household\n\nmember in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).     At the end of\n\nthe trial, the Commonwealth moved to continue sentencing until\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\nafter the juvenile turned eighteen.   The Juvenile Court judge\n\nallowed the motion after an evidentiary hearing.    She did so on\n\nthe ground that the juvenile's desperate need of aid,\n\nencouragement, and guidance could not be satisfied in the\n\nlimited time before he turned eighteen, and that it was in the\n\njuvenile's best interest to postpone sentencing so that he could\n\nobtain services necessary for his rehabilitation.      The juvenile\n\nhas appealed.\n\n    While the appeal has been pending, the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt decided Noah N. v. Commonwealth, 489 Mass. 498 (2022)\n\n(Noah N.), in which it held that a judge is permitted to allow a\n\ncontinuance beyond a juvenile's eighteenth birthday for the sole\n\npurpose of extending the time of commitment, but only after the\n\njudge conducts an evidentiary hearing and makes express findings\n\nto the effect that the continuance is necessary to ensure the\n\nrehabilitation of the juvenile.   Id. at 502-503.   The court\n\nplaced the burden on the Commonwealth to prove by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that continued commitment is necessary to\n\nensure the juvenile's rehabilitation.    Id. at 503.\n\n    The juvenile argues that Noah N. announced a new rule that\n\nshould not apply retroactively to him.   In the alternative, the\n\njuvenile argues that the requirements of Noah N. were not\n\nsatisfied in this case.   Further, relying on Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) (Apprendi), the juvenile argues that\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nthe framework established in Noah N. violates his rights under\n\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nbecause it permits a judge to extend a sentence merely upon a\n\nshowing by clear and convincing evidence, instead of reserving\n\nthat determination to a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Finally, the juvenile argues that his due process rights\n\nwere violated because the delay in sentencing gave the\n\nCommonwealth a \"tactical advantage.\"    We affirm the adjudication\n\nof delinquency and the order allowing the motion to continue.1\n\n     Background.   On February 4, 2021, approximately four months\n\nbefore the juvenile was to turn eighteen, he was charged with\n\nassault and battery on a family or household member, in\n\nviolation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).   The juvenile and his\n\ncounsel pursued a strategy to have the charge tried before he\n\nturned eighteen to attempt to prevent the judge from sentencing\n\nhim beyond that age.   See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58.   To that end,\n\nbelieving that a bench trial was likely to be scheduled sooner\n\nthan a jury trial, the juvenile waived his right to a jury\n\ntrial.\n\n\n     1 The Commonwealth agrees that this appeal is not moot, even\nthough the juvenile's commitment to the custody of the\nDepartment of Youth Services (DYS) has ended, and he is now over\ntwenty years old. We are of the same view and conclude, for the\nreasons explained in Matter of a Minor, 484 Mass. 295, 299-300\n(2020), that the juvenile has a surviving interest in\nestablishing that the commitment order was not lawfully issued.\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\n     As the juvenile and his counsel hoped, the case was tried\n\nover two days approximately one month before the juvenile's\n\neighteenth birthday.   At the conclusion of the trial, the judge\n\nadjudged the juvenile delinquent.    The juvenile does not\n\nchallenge the adjudication of delinquency on appeal on\n\nevidentiary grounds, and we now recite the facts underlying the\n\nadjudication as the judge found them.2\n\n     In 2018, the juvenile -- six feet, two inches tall and\n\nweighing 210 pounds -- and the victim -- four feet, eleven\n\ninches tall and weighing 118 pounds -- began an intimate\n\nrelationship.   The victim ended the relationship around January\n\n2021, after she discovered that the juvenile had been cheating.\n\nThe following month, on February 3, 2021, the victim went to the\n\njuvenile's home to talk.   After a conversation lasting around\n\nfifteen to twenty minutes, the victim said she wanted to go\n\nhome.    The juvenile grabbed her arm to prevent her from leaving\n\nand threw her onto his bed.    When the victim again attempted to\n\nleave and repeated that she wished to go home, the juvenile\n\nstruck her, causing her to fall back onto the bed.    The juvenile\n\nthen repeatedly punched, slapped, and spit at the victim, who\n\nwent into a fetal position, covering her face with her arms.\n\n\n\n\n     2 The judge made detailed and comprehensive written findings\nof fact in her decision on the motion to continue sentencing,\nand we draw our recitation of the facts from those findings.\n\f                                                                     5\n\n\nDespite the victim's request that he stop, the juvenile\n\ncontinued to beat her while atop her and said, \"[S]hut the fuck\n\nup bitch.\"   Eventually, the juvenile stood up and told the\n\nvictim, \"I fucking love you, don't you fucking get it.\"     When\n\nthe victim then attempted to leave, the juvenile again called\n\nher a \"bitch,\" punched her in the back of the head, and caused\n\nher to fall to her knees.    He then grabbed the victim by the\n\nhair and dragged her through the bedroom.    Eventually, the\n\nvictim was able to leave the juvenile's room and called 911.3\n\nOfficers responded quickly and found the victim crying, with\n\nvisible scratches on her hand and both sides of her neck.      The\n\nvictim was taken to a hospital where she was treated for\n\napproximately three hours.   At the time of the trial, she\n\ncontinued to suffer long-term injuries from the assault and was\n\nattending ongoing physical therapy twice a week for injury to\n\nher spine and for pain while sitting or walking.\n\n     The juvenile moved for immediate sentencing as soon as the\n\njudge adjudged the juvenile delinquent at the conclusion of the\n\ntrial.   The Commonwealth moved to stay sentencing until after\n\nthe juvenile's eighteenth birthday, a request the juvenile\n\nopposed.   At the beginning of the ensuing evidentiary hearing,\n\nbefore she allowed extensive argument from counsel, the judge\n\n\n     3 Members of the juvenile's family attempted to interfere\nwith the victim's 911 call.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nstated that she was inclined to allow the motion and explained\n\nher reasoning as follows:\n\n     \"So when I think about what transpired here -- this was a\n     horrific beating that transpired involving an intimate\n     partner of his -- the goals of the juvenile court are to\n     make sure that [the juvenile] receives the treatment\n     necessary in order to make sure that he has the services in\n     place, that he gains insight as to what transpired here, to\n     make sure that he goes on into adulthood he has the\n     capacity, understanding, and ability to control himself and\n     to engage in a safe and appropriate relationship with\n     individuals of the opposite sex.\n\n     \"So I can't imagine that in three weeks, which I think is\n     his -- his birthday is mid-June -- that that's going to be\n     accomplished by sentencing him for a three-week sentence.\"\n\nThe judge also expressly stated that she was \"not looking at\n\npunishment, . . . [but] at engagement in services to make sure\n\nthat [the juvenile] engage[s] in intimate partner abuse\n\nprevention, to make sure he receives the counseling necessary in\n\norder to be able to prevent that type of thing.\"   The judge\n\nrepeated during the course of argument that \"given the time\n\nperiods and the particulars of this case, I don't see that it\n\nis[] reasonable in any way, shape, or form to commit him to\n\n[the] D[epartment of] Y[outh] S[ervices] [DYS] for three weeks.\n\nIt wouldn't even entail the start of services in that time\n\nperiod.\"4\n\n\n\n\n     4 The judge also gave weight to the juvenile's delinquency\nrecord as well as to the fact that the juvenile had violated\nprobation in the past and was therefore not a good candidate for\nprobation. The judge also considered that, even if probation\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\n    Counsel for the juvenile then asked to call a witness from\n\nDYS and to present additional evidence.   The judge allowed both\n\nrequests.   Prior to the introduction of this evidence, the judge\n\npermitted the victim to make a victim impact statement.    The\n\nvictim laid out the details of the assault and its continuing\n\npsychological and physical effects.   The judge then repeated the\n\nbasis for her ruling to continue sentencing:\n\n    \"So again, as I stated, taking into consideration the\n    nature and circumstances of this offense, the victim impact\n    statement, the juvenile's delinquency record which, as I\n    indicated, includes a continuation without a finding and a\n    commitment to DYS for similar offenses, assault and battery\n    type violent offenses, the lack of success that he has had\n    on probation, and the concerns the [c]ourt has in not\n    addressing the violence that has been on display here for\n    the past two days,[5] I didn't think it serves his interests\n    or meets the needs and interest of the [J]uvenile [C]ourt\n    in committing him for three weeks.\"\n\nThe juvenile then presented additional evidence, including the\n\ntestimony of the juvenile's DYS caseworker.    The caseworker, who\n\nhad worked with the juvenile for three years, testified that the\n\njuvenile would benefit from additional DYS services, including\n\nindividual therapy, prosocial activities in the community, and\n\nfamily work.   He also testified that, should the juvenile be\n\n\n\nwere available, a one-month probation would not allow sufficient\nservices to rehabilitate the juvenile.\n\n    5  The judge was apparently referring to the testimonial\nevidence of violence during the assault on the victim. The\nrecord does not suggest that there was violence on display in\nthe courthouse during the trial.\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\ncommitted to DYS custody after he turned eighteen, he would be\n\nreleased to the community with services after three to five\n\nmonths.6\n\n     After further discussion of issues that are not implicated\n\nin this appeal, the judge then allowed the Commonwealth's motion\n\nand continued sentencing to the day after the juvenile was to\n\nturn eighteen.     The judge subsequently issued a detailed written\n\nmemorandum of decision containing a nuanced analysis of the\n\nissue and explained, among other things, that her\n\n     \"paramount concern [wa]s that the [j]uvenile in this matter\n     is in desperate need of aid, encouragement, and guidance.\n     The purpose of committing a [j]uvenile after a finding of\n     delinquency is not only correction, but the redemption to\n     society of the offending child. These goals cannot be\n     satisfied within the narrow window of time between when the\n     juvenile was adjudicated delinquent and when he turns\n     eighteen. Therefore, it would not be in the 'best\n     interest' of the [j]uvenile here to move forward with\n     sentencing that would fail to adequately 'encourag[e] and\n     help[ ] [him] to become [a] law-abiding and productive\n     member[ ] of society.'\" (Quotation and citations omitted.)\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Magnus M., 461 Mass. 459, 461, 466 (2012).\n\n     Sentencing occurred on June 24, 2021, the day after the\n\njuvenile's eighteenth birthday, and the juvenile was committed\n\nto DYS custody until he turned nineteen.     This appeal followed.\n\n     Discussion.    The juvenile's overarching argument is that\n\nthe judge abused her discretion or committed other error of law\n\n\n     6 The juvenile argues, based on the caseworker's testimony,\nthat should the judge continue sentencing, the juvenile would\nnot receive services until the continued date.\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nby allowing the motion to continue sentencing until after the\n\njuvenile turned eighteen.    Within that overarching argument, the\n\njuvenile makes a number of subsidiary arguments that are in some\n\nform or fashion driven by the Supreme Judicial Court's decision\n\nin Noah N., which was decided after the judge allowed the motion\n\nto continue and while this appeal has been pending.     We\n\naccordingly begin our analysis with Noah N.\n\n      When the juvenile in Noah N. was seventeen years old, he\n\nwas charged in a delinquency complaint with assault and battery\n\non a family or household member.   See Noah N., 489 Mass. at 499.\n\nApproximately one month before he was to turn eighteen, he filed\n\na tender of plea or admission to the charge.    Id.   The\n\nCommonwealth then requested a continuance of the change of plea\n\nhearing \"for the express purpose of delaying the case's\n\ndisposition until after the juvenile's eighteenth birthday.\"\n\nId.   The Juvenile Court judge allowed the Commonwealth's motion,\n\nand accordingly, Noah's eighteenth birthday passed without his\n\nplea being tendered.   Id.   On appeal to the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt, Noah argued that because he had sought to tender a plea\n\nwhen he was seventeen, he should have benefited from the\n\nprovisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., which required\n\nthat any commitment to DYS custody end when he turned eighteen.7\n\n\n      7General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., provides in\nrelevant part:\n\f                                                                     10\n\n\nNoah N., supra at 501.     Noah argued that allowing a continuance\n\nfor the sole purpose of committing him until age nineteen was\n\ncontrary to the statute.     Id.\n\n    The Supreme Judicial Court noted that \u00a7 58 does not\n\nexpressly address continuances, stating,\n\n    \"This is understandable, as continuances are an ordinary\n    aspect of an orderly judicial process. If a case is\n    continued for reasons related to the judicial process and\n    unrelated to extending the time of commitment, then the\n    statutory requirements for extending such time of\n    commitment are clearly met. Allowing continuances for the\n    sole purpose of extending the commitment period are,\n    however, different. Such continuances, if they do not\n    otherwise serve the purposes of the judicial process,\n    intrude on the Legislature's authority to set limits on the\n    time of commitment. Allowing continuances for this reason\n    alone raises the question whether the statutory language\n    regarding disposal of cases is being manipulated to extend\n    the time of commitment beyond what the Legislature\n    intended.\"\n\nNoah N., 489 Mass. at 501.     Accordingly, the court held that\n\n    \"[w]here a request for a continuance has nothing to do with\n    the orderly disposition of the case, but rather is directed\n    at the timing of the juvenile's impending eighteenth\n    birthday, and at extending the time of commitment beyond\n    that ordinarily authorized by statute, the ample discretion\n    allowed Juvenile Court judges is tightly constrained. A\n    continuance may only be allowed in such circumstances if it\n\n\n\n\n    \"If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child on a\n    complaint, the court . . . may commit him [or her] to the\n    custody of [DYS], but the . . . commitment period shall not\n    be for a period longer than until such child attains the\n    age of eighteen, or nineteen in the case of a child whose\n    case is disposed of after he [or she] has attained his [or\n    her] eighteenth birthday or age [twenty] in the case of a\n    child whose case is disposed of after he [or she] has\n    attained his [or her] nineteenth birthday.\"\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\n     is necessary to ensure the rehabilitation of the juvenile\n     and express findings are made to that effect.\"\n\nId. at 502.    The court required that the judge hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing, and that the \"Commonwealth bears the burden\n\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence the necessity of\n\ncontinued commitment to ensure the rehabilitation of the\n\njuvenile.\"    Id. at 503.\n\n     Noah N., as we have already noted, was decided after the\n\njudge in this case allowed the continuance on appeal here.\n\nThere is no doubt that Noah N. announced new rules with respect\n\nto the legal standard for allowing a motion to continue for the\n\nsole purpose of extending the time for which a juvenile may be\n\ncommitted, to the need for an evidentiary hearing before\n\nallowing such a motion, and to the Commonwealth's burden of\n\nproof.8   See Commonwealth v. Sylvain, 466 Mass. 422, 428 (2013),\n\nS.C., 473 Mass. 832 (2016), quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.\n\n\n     8 Prior to Noah N., continuances in delinquency proceedings\nneeded only to be assessed against the requirements of the rules\nof criminal procedure, which permit continuances \"only when\nbased upon cause and only when necessary to insure that the\ninterests of justice are served.\" Mass. R. Crim. P. 10 (a) (1),\n378 Mass. 861 (1979). \"In most cases, 'cause' refers to reasons\nrelated to the orderly processing of cases.\" Noah N., 489 Mass.\nat 502. Rehabilitation, which is the central purpose of\njuvenile justice, could and can satisfy rule 10 (a) (1)'s\nrequirement that an extension be in \"the interests of justice.\"\nId. However, prior to Noah N., there was no requirement that\nthe Commonwealth prove the need for rehabilitation by clear and\nconvincing evidence, or that the judge conduct an evidentiary\nhearing and make express findings regarding the need for\nrehabilitation.\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\n288, 301 (1989) (\"a case announces a new rule when it breaks new\n\nground or imposes a new obligation . . . [or] if the result was\n\nnot dictated by precedent existing at the time the [adjudication\n\nof delinquency] became final\" [emphasis in original]).   Although\n\na new rule does not generally have retroactive application, it\n\nwill apply retroactively to cases -- such as this one -- that\n\nare pending on direct appeal when the new rule is announced.\n\nSee Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 466\n\nMass. 655, 664 (2013), S.C., 471 Mass. 12 (2015).   We\n\naccordingly disagree with the juvenile's argument that Noah N.\n\ndoes not apply retroactively to him.\n\n    Alternatively, the juvenile argues that the requirements of\n\nNoah N. were not satisfied.   We begin by noting that the judge,\n\nwith remarkable prescience, foresaw Noah N.'s core requirement\n\nthat the continuance be necessary for the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation.   Moreover, the judge anticipated and satisfied\n\nNoah N.'s requirements that she conduct an evidentiary hearing\n\nand make detailed findings.   In other words, the central\n\npurpose, thrust, and procedural safeguards of Noah N. were\n\nclearly satisfied.   But the juvenile contends that what happened\n\nhere nonetheless fell short of what was required.   Specifically,\n\nthe juvenile points to the fact that the Commonwealth presented\n\nno evidence during the evidentiary portion of the hearing on the\n\nmotion to continue, and that the judge did not state the\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\nevidentiary standard by which she assessed the juvenile's need\n\nfor rehabilitation.   The juvenile argues that both shortcomings\n\nare fatal.\n\n    As to the first, although Noah N. clearly places the burden\n\non the Commonwealth to prove by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the continuance is necessary for the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation, the opinion does not suggest that trial evidence\n\ncannot be used to meet the Commonwealth's burden.     Nor does Noah\n\nN. stand for the proposition that the Commonwealth must\n\nintroduce evidence of the juvenile's need for rehabilitation\n\ntwice:   once at trial, and again at the time of the evidentiary\n\nhearing on the motion to continue.   The circumstances in Noah N.\n\nwere materially different than those presented here.    In Noah\n\nN., the motion to continue was filed pretrial, no evidentiary\n\nproceeding bearing on the juvenile's need for rehabilitation had\n\nyet occurred during the case and, as a result, there was no\n\nevidence upon which the judge could have made the required\n\nfindings regarding the need for rehabilitation.   Here, by\n\ncontrast, the motion to continue came directly on the heels of a\n\nbench trial during which ample evidence had been introduced to\n\nsupport the required findings regarding the juvenile's need for\n\nrehabilitation.   And, in addition, the judge was the trier of\n\nfact for both the trial and the motion to continue.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\n     As to the second, it is true that the judge did not state\n\nthat she was applying a clear and convincing standard in\n\nassessing the juvenile's need for rehabilitation.9   We have\n\naccordingly considered whether the matter should be remanded,\n\nbecause it is ordinarily for the trial court judge to make such\n\na determination in the first instance -- not us.10   Cf. Adoption\n\nof Eden, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 296 (2015) (\"it is for the trial\n\njudge, not us, to determine in the first instance whether\n\nunfitness has been proven by clear and convincing evidence, and\n\nwhether termination of parental rights is in the best interests\n\nof the children\").   Importantly, the juvenile does not contend\n\nthat any of the judge's extensive and detailed subsidiary\n\nfindings made in connection with the motion to continue is\n\nclearly erroneous.   Nor does the juvenile challenge the\n\nsubsidiary findings underlying the adjudication of delinquency\n\nthat, as a matter of law, were required to be made upon proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.   G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, first par.;\n\nMagnus M., 461 Mass. at 462-463.   In these circumstances, we are\n\nin sufficient position to review whether clear and convincing\n\nevidence supported the judge's ultimate determination that the\n\n\n     9 This is no fault of the judge who, after all, did not have\nthe benefit of Noah N. when acting on the motion to continue.\nSee Noah N., 489 Mass. at 503 n.5.\n\n     10The juvenile does not seek a remand, which he views as an\nempty exercise since he has already turned twenty.\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\njuvenile was in need of rehabilitation.   Cf. Doe, Sex Offender\n\nRegistry Bd. No. 496501 v. Sex Offender Registry Bd., 482 Mass.\n\n643, 657 & n.4 (2019) (where requirement of explicit finding on\n\nclear and convincing evidence not created until after\n\nadministrative decision, court retains discretion to determine\n\nwhether factual record is sufficiently clear that remand to\n\napply heightened burden of proof is unnecessary).\n\n    \"Proof by clear and convincing evidence is 'not without\n\nteeth[,]' . . . [and] [t]he evidence must be sufficient to\n\nconvey a 'high degree of probability' that the contested\n\nproposition is true.\"   Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 380316\n\nv. Sex Offender Registry Bd., 473 Mass. 297, 309 (2015), quoting\n\nCallahan v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 372 Mass. 582, 588\n\nn.3 (1977).   This \"means that '[t]he requisite proof must be\n\nstrong and positive; it must be \"full, clear and decisive.\"'\"\n\nAdoption of Chad, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 828, 838 (2019), quoting\n\nAdoption of Iris, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 105 (1997).     Without\n\nrepeating the judge's findings, which we have already set out,\n\nthe standard was easily met here.\n\n    The juvenile next argues that the Noah N. framework\n\nconflicts with the requirements of Apprendi, and violates his\n\nrights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because it permits a\n\njudge to extend a sentence merely upon a showing by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, instead of reserving that determination to\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\na jury upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.     Apprendi holds\n\nthat \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\"    Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.   See\n\nCommonwealth v. Denehy, 466 Mass. 723, 736 (2014), quoting\n\nAlleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99, 112, 114-115 (2013)\n\n(Apprendi applies to \"any fact that aggravates the punishment,\n\neither by raising the floor or the ceiling, such that 'the fact\n\n. . . alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a\n\ncriminal defendant is exposed'\").    Cf. Lazlo L. v. Commonwealth,\n\n482 Mass. 325, 330 (2019) (\"a deprivation of liberty imposed by\n\nthe State as a direct consequence of being found delinquent for\n\nhaving committed an offense necessarily includes an element of\n\npunishment\"); Commonwealth v. Quincy Q., 434 Mass. 859, 864-865\n\n(2001) (acknowledging that, under Apprendi, any fact necessary\n\nto increase delinquent juvenile's penalty beyond statutory\n\nmaximum commitment to DYS must be proved to jury beyond\n\nreasonable doubt).     \"The 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi\n\npurposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on\n\nthe basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted\n\nby the defendant.\"     Southern Union Co. v. United States, 567\n\nU.S. 343, 348 (2012), quoting Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.\n\n296, 303 (2004).\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\n     Here, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, limited the seventeen year old\n\njuvenile's potential sentence to a maximum commitment to DYS\n\ncustody to age eighteen.   Noah N., however, permits a judge to\n\nallow a continuance for the sole purpose of committing a\n\njuvenile beyond the statutory maximum if the judge finds, upon\n\nclear and convincing proof, that a longer period of commitment\n\nis necessary for the juvenile's rehabilitation.   The juvenile's\n\nneed for rehabilitation is not a fact reflected in the\n\nadjudication of delinquency for assault and battery on a\n\nhousehold or family member.   It follows, the juvenile argues,\n\nthat the framework established in Noah N. is in conflict with\n\nApprendi because the juvenile's need for rehabilitation should\n\nhave been determined by a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.11\n\n     Whatever merit this interesting argument may have, it is\n\nnot for us to decide it.   \"[W]e have no power to alter, overrule\n\nor decline to follow the holding of cases the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt has decided.\"   Commonwealth v. Dube, 59 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n476, 485 (2003).   It is for the Supreme Judicial Court to\n\n\n\n\n     11The juvenile does not attempt to explain what\nsignificance, if any, his waiver of trial by jury has on this\nargument. Nor does it appear he has considered whether\nrequiring a jury trial on the question of rehabilitation could\nresult in delay beyond the juvenile's eighteenth birthday itself\naffecting the juvenile's potential sentence.\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\ndetermine whether Noah N. is in irreconcilable tension with\n\nApprendi, not us.12\n\n     Finally, the juvenile argues that the continuance gave the\n\nCommonwealth a tactical advantage in violation of his due\n\nprocess rights.   The main weakness in this argument is that the\n\njuvenile fails to articulate what tactical advantage the\n\nCommonwealth obtained from the continuance.   Cf. Commonwealth v.\n\nImbruglia, 377 Mass. 682, 691 (1979) (pretrial delay\n\nintentionally undertaken to gain tactical advantage is\n\nimpermissible).   The case had already been tried, and the judge\n\nhad already adjudged the juvenile delinquent before the\n\nCommonwealth moved for a continuance.   Furthermore, the juvenile\n\nmisapprehends the purpose of the continuance, which was not to\n\nadvantage the Commonwealth but to help ensure the juvenile's\n\nrehabilitation.\n\n     There was no error in the order allowing the motion for a\n\ncontinuance.\n\n                                    Judgment affirmed.\n\n                                    Order allowing motion to\n                                      continue sentencing\n                                      affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     12We requested and received the briefs filed in Noah N.,\nand we note that the Supreme Judicial Court does not appear to\nhave been alerted to the potential interplay between Apprendi\nand the standard for allowing a continuance for the sole purpose\nof extending sentence in a delinquency proceeding.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">NOTICE: All slip opinions and orders are subject to formal\nrevision and are superseded by the advance sheets and bound\nvolumes of the Official Reports.

In the alternative, the\n\njuvenile argues that the requirements of Noah N. were not\n\nsatisfied in this case.   Further, relying on Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\">530 U.S. 466</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000) (Apprendi), the juvenile argues that\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nthe framework established in Noah N. violates his rights under\n\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nbecause it permits a judge to extend a sentence merely upon a\n\nshowing by clear and convincing evidence, instead of reserving\n\nthat determination to a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Finally, the juvenile argues that his due process rights\n\nwere violated because the delay in sentencing gave the\n\nCommonwealth a &quot;tactical advantage.&quot;    We affirm the adjudication\n\nof delinquency and the order allowing the motion to continue.1\n\n     Background.   On February 4, 2021, approximately four months\n\nbefore the juvenile was to turn eighteen, he was charged with\n\nassault and battery on a family or household member, in\n\nviolation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (a).   The juvenile and his\n\ncounsel pursued a strategy to have the charge tried before he\n\nturned eighteen to attempt to prevent the judge from sentencing\n\nhim beyond that age.   See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58.   To that end,\n\nbelieving that a bench trial was likely to be scheduled sooner\n\nthan a jury trial, the juvenile waived his right to a jury\n\ntrial.\n\n\n     1 The Commonwealth agrees that this appeal is not moot, even\nthough the juvenile&#x27;s commitment to the custody of the\nDepartment of Youth Services (DYS) has ended, and he is now over\ntwenty years old. We are of the same view and conclude, for the\nreasons explained in Matter of a Minor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">484 Mass. 295</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299-300\n(2020), that the juvenile has a surviving interest in\nestablishing that the commitment order was not lawfully issued.\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\n     As the juvenile and his counsel hoped, the case was tried\n\nover two days approximately one month before the juvenile&#x27;s\n\neighteenth birthday.   At the conclusion of the trial, the judge\n\nadjudged the juvenile delinquent.    The juvenile does not\n\nchallenge the adjudication of delinquency on appeal on\n\nevidentiary grounds, and we now recite the facts underlying the\n\nadjudication as the judge found them.2\n\n     In 2018, the juvenile -- six feet, two inches tall and\n\nweighing 210 pounds -- and the victim -- four feet, eleven\n\ninches tall and weighing 118 pounds -- began an intimate\n\nrelationship.   The victim ended the relationship around January\n\n2021, after she discovered that the juvenile had been cheating.\n\nThe following month, on February 3, 2021, the victim went to the\n\njuvenile&#x27;s home to talk.   After a conversation lasting around\n\nfifteen to twenty minutes, the victim said she wanted to go\n\nhome.    The juvenile grabbed her arm to prevent her from leaving\n\nand threw her onto his bed.    When the victim again attempted to\n\nleave and repeated that she wished to go home, the juvenile\n\nstruck her, causing her to fall back onto the bed.    The juvenile\n\nthen repeatedly punched, slapped, and spit at the victim, who\n\nwent into a fetal position, covering her face with her arms.\n\n\n\n\n     2 The judge made detailed and comprehensive written findings\nof fact in her decision on the motion to continue sentencing,\nand we draw our recitation of the facts from those findings.\n\f                                                                     5\n\n\nDespite the victim&#x27;s request that he stop, the juvenile\n\ncontinued to beat her while atop her and said, &quot;[S]hut the fuck\n\nup bitch.&quot;   Eventually, the juvenile stood up and told the\n\nvictim, &quot;I fucking love you, don&#x27;t you fucking get it.&quot;     When\n\nthe victim then attempted to leave, the juvenile again called\n\nher a &quot;bitch,&quot; punched her in the back of the head, and caused\n\nher to fall to her knees.    He then grabbed the victim by the\n\nhair and dragged her through the bedroom.    Eventually, the\n\nvictim was able to leave the juvenile&#x27;s room and called 911.3\n\nOfficers responded quickly and found the victim crying, with\n\nvisible scratches on her hand and both sides of her neck.      The\n\nvictim was taken to a hospital where she was treated for\n\napproximately three hours.   At the time of the trial, she\n\ncontinued to suffer long-term injuries from the assault and was\n\nattending ongoing physical therapy twice a week for injury to\n\nher spine and for pain while sitting or walking.\n\n     The juvenile moved for immediate sentencing as soon as the\n\njudge adjudged the juvenile delinquent at the conclusion of the\n\ntrial.   The Commonwealth moved to stay sentencing until after\n\nthe juvenile&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, a request the juvenile\n\nopposed.   At the beginning of the ensuing evidentiary hearing,\n\nbefore she allowed extensive argument from counsel, the judge\n\n\n     3 Members of the juvenile&#x27;s family attempted to interfere\nwith the victim&#x27;s 911 call.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nstated that she was inclined to allow the motion and explained\n\nher reasoning as follows:\n\n     &quot;So when I think about what transpired here -- this was a\n     horrific beating that transpired involving an intimate\n     partner of his -- the goals of the juvenile court are to\n     make sure that [the juvenile] receives the treatment\n     necessary in order to make sure that he has the services in\n     place, that he gains insight as to what transpired here, to\n     make sure that he goes on into adulthood he has the\n     capacity, understanding, and ability to control himself and\n     to engage in a safe and appropriate relationship with\n     individuals of the opposite sex.\n\n     &quot;So I can&#x27;t imagine that in three weeks, which I think is\n     his -- his birthday is mid-June -- that that&#x27;s going to be\n     accomplished by sentencing him for a three-week sentence.&quot;\n\nThe judge also expressly stated that she was &quot;not looking at\n\npunishment, . . . [but] at engagement in services to make sure\n\nthat [the juvenile] engage[s] in intimate partner abuse\n\nprevention, to make sure he receives the counseling necessary in\n\norder to be able to prevent that type of thing.&quot;   The judge\n\nrepeated during the course of argument that &quot;given the time\n\nperiods and the particulars of this case, I don&#x27;t see that it\n\nis[] reasonable in any way, shape, or form to commit him to\n\n[the] D[epartment of] Y[outh] S[ervices] [DYS] for three weeks.\n\nIt wouldn&#x27;t even entail the start of services in that time\n\nperiod.&quot;4\n\n\n\n\n     4 The judge also gave weight to the juvenile&#x27;s delinquency\nrecord as well as to the fact that the juvenile had violated\nprobation in the past and was therefore not a good candidate for\nprobation. The judge also considered that, even if probation\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\n    Counsel for the juvenile then asked to call a witness from\n\nDYS and to present additional evidence.   The judge allowed both\n\nrequests.   Prior to the introduction of this evidence, the judge\n\npermitted the victim to make a victim impact statement.    The\n\nvictim laid out the details of the assault and its continuing\n\npsychological and physical effects.   The judge then repeated the\n\nbasis for her ruling to continue sentencing:\n\n    &quot;So again, as I stated, taking into consideration the\n    nature and circumstances of this offense, the victim impact\n    statement, the juvenile&#x27;s delinquency record which, as I\n    indicated, includes a continuation without a finding and a\n    commitment to DYS for similar offenses, assault and battery\n    type violent offenses, the lack of success that he has had\n    on probation, and the concerns the [c]ourt has in not\n    addressing the violence that has been on display here for\n    the past two days,[5] I didn&#x27;t think it serves his interests\n    or meets the needs and interest of the [J]uvenile [C]ourt\n    in committing him for three weeks.&quot;\n\nThe juvenile then presented additional evidence, including the\n\ntestimony of the juvenile&#x27;s DYS caseworker.    The caseworker, who\n\nhad worked with the juvenile for three years, testified that the\n\njuvenile would benefit from additional DYS services, including\n\nindividual therapy, prosocial activities in the community, and\n\nfamily work.   He also testified that, should the juvenile be\n\n\n\nwere available, a one-month probation would not allow sufficient\nservices to rehabilitate the juvenile.\n\n    5  The judge was apparently referring to the testimonial\nevidence of violence during the assault on the victim. The\nrecord does not suggest that there was violence on display in\nthe courthouse during the trial.\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\ncommitted to DYS custody after he turned eighteen, he would be\n\nreleased to the community with services after three to five\n\nmonths.6\n\n     After further discussion of issues that are not implicated\n\nin this appeal, the judge then allowed the Commonwealth&#x27;s motion\n\nand continued sentencing to the day after the juvenile was to\n\nturn eighteen.     The judge subsequently issued a detailed written\n\nmemorandum of decision containing a nuanced analysis of the\n\nissue and explained, among other things, that her\n\n     &quot;paramount concern [wa]s that the [j]uvenile in this matter\n     is in desperate need of aid, encouragement, and guidance.\n     The purpose of committing a [j]uvenile after a finding of\n     delinquency is not only correction, but the redemption to\n     society of the offending child. These goals cannot be\n     satisfied within the narrow window of time between when the\n     juvenile was adjudicated delinquent and when he turns\n     eighteen. Therefore, it would not be in the &#x27;best\n     interest&#x27; of the [j]uvenile here to move forward with\n     sentencing that would fail to adequately &#x27;encourag[e] and\n     help[ ] [him] to become [a] law-abiding and productive\n     member[ ] of society.&#x27;&quot; (Quotation and citations omitted.)\n\nSee Commonwealth v.

This appeal followed.\n\n     Discussion.    The juvenile&#x27;s overarching argument is that\n\nthe judge abused her discretion or committed other error of law\n\n\n     6 The juvenile argues, based on the caseworker&#x27;s testimony,\nthat should the judge continue sentencing, the juvenile would\nnot receive services until the continued date.\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nby allowing the motion to continue sentencing until after the\n\njuvenile turned eighteen.    Within that overarching argument, the\n\njuvenile makes a number of subsidiary arguments that are in some\n\nform or fashion driven by the Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s decision\n\nin Noah N., which was decided after the judge allowed the motion\n\nto continue and while this appeal has been pending.     We\n\naccordingly begin our analysis with Noah N.\n\n      When the juvenile in Noah N. was seventeen years old, he\n\nwas charged in a delinquency complaint with assault and battery\n\non a family or household member.   See Noah N., 489 Mass. at 499.\n\nApproximately one month before he was to turn eighteen, he filed\n\na tender of plea or admission to the charge.    Id.   The\n\nCommonwealth then requested a continuance of the change of plea\n\nhearing &quot;for the express purpose of delaying the case&#x27;s\n\ndisposition until after the juvenile&#x27;s eighteenth birthday.&quot;\n\nId.   The Juvenile Court judge allowed the Commonwealth&#x27;s motion,\n\nand accordingly, Noah&#x27;s eighteenth birthday passed without his\n\nplea being tendered.   Id.   On appeal to the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt, Noah argued that because he had sought to tender a plea\n\nwhen he was seventeen, he should have benefited from the\n\nprovisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., which required\n\nthat any commitment to DYS custody end when he turned eighteen.7\n\n\n      7General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 58, second par., provides in\nrelevant part:\n\f                                                                     10\n\n\nNoah N., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\">supra at 501</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.     Noah argued that allowing a continuance\n\nfor the sole purpose of committing him until age nineteen was\n\ncontrary to the statute.     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n    The Supreme Judicial Court noted that \u00a7 58 does not\n\nexpressly address continuances, stating,\n\n    &quot;This is understandable, as continuances are an ordinary\n    aspect of an orderly judicial process. If a case is\n    continued for reasons related to the judicial process and\n    unrelated to extending the time of commitment, then the\n    statutory requirements for extending such time of\n    commitment are clearly met. Allowing continuances for the\n    sole purpose of extending the commitment period are,\n    however, different. Such continuances, if they do not\n    otherwise serve the purposes of the judicial process,\n    intrude on the Legislature&#x27;s authority to set limits on the\n    time of commitment. Allowing continuances for this reason\n    alone raises the question whether the statutory language\n    regarding disposal of cases is being manipulated to extend\n    the time of commitment beyond what the Legislature\n    intended.&quot;\n\nNoah N., 489 Mass. at 501.     Accordingly, the court held that\n\n    &quot;[w]here a request for a continuance has nothing to do with\n    the orderly disposition of the case, but rather is directed\n    at the timing of the juvenile&#x27;s impending eighteenth\n    birthday, and at extending the time of commitment beyond\n    that ordinarily authorized by statute, the ample discretion\n    allowed Juvenile Court judges is tightly constrained. A\n    continuance may only be allowed in such circumstances if it\n\n\n\n\n    &quot;If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child on a\n    complaint, the court . . . may commit him [or her] to the\n    custody of [DYS], but the . . . commitment period shall not\n    be for a period longer than until such child attains the\n    age of eighteen, or nineteen in the case of a child whose\n    case is disposed of after he [or she] has attained his [or\n    her] eighteenth birthday or age [twenty] in the case of a\n    child whose case is disposed of after he [or she] has\n    attained his [or her] nineteenth birthday.&quot;\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\n     is necessary to ensure the rehabilitation of the juvenile\n     and express findings are made to that effect.&quot;\n\nId. at 502.    The court required that the judge hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing, and that the &quot;Commonwealth bears the burden\n\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence the necessity of\n\ncontinued commitment to ensure the rehabilitation of the\n\njuvenile.&quot;    Id. at 503.\n\n     Noah N., as we have already noted, was decided after the\n\njudge in this case allowed the continuance on appeal here.\n\nThere is no doubt that Noah N. announced new rules with respect\n\nto the legal standard for allowing a motion to continue for the\n\nsole purpose of extending the time for which a juvenile may be\n\ncommitted, to the need for an evidentiary hearing before\n\nallowing such a motion, and to the Commonwealth&#x27;s burden of\n\nproof.8   See Commonwealth v.

However, prior to Noah N., there was no requirement that\nthe Commonwealth prove the need for rehabilitation by clear and\nconvincing evidence, or that the judge conduct an evidentiary\nhearing and make express findings regarding the need for\nrehabilitation.\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\n288, 301 (1989) (&quot;a case announces a new rule when it breaks new\n\nground or imposes a new obligation . . .

Although\n\na new rule does not generally have retroactive application, it\n\nwill apply retroactively to cases -- such as this one -- that\n\nare pending on direct appeal when the new rule is announced.\n\nSee Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6454937\"><a href=\"/opinion/6580758/diatchenko-v-district-attorney-for-the-suffolk-district/\">466\n\nMass. 655</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (2013), S.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">471 Mass. 12</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015).   We\n\naccordingly disagree with the juvenile&#x27;s argument that Noah N.\n\ndoes not apply retroactively to him.\n\n    Alternatively, the juvenile argues that the requirements of\n\nNoah N. were not satisfied.   We begin by noting that the judge,\n\nwith remarkable prescience, foresaw Noah N.&#x27;s core requirement\n\nthat the continuance be necessary for the juvenile&#x27;s\n\nrehabilitation.   Moreover, the judge anticipated and satisfied\n\nNoah N.&#x27;s requirements that she conduct an evidentiary hearing\n\nand make detailed findings.   In other words, the central\n\npurpose, thrust, and procedural safeguards of Noah N. were\n\nclearly satisfied.   But the juvenile contends that what happened\n\nhere nonetheless fell short of what was required.   Specifically,\n\nthe juvenile points to the fact that the Commonwealth presented\n\nno evidence during the evidentiary portion of the hearing on the\n\nmotion to continue, and that the judge did not state the\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\nevidentiary standard by which she assessed the juvenile&#x27;s need\n\nfor rehabilitation.   The juvenile argues that both shortcomings\n\nare fatal.\n\n    As to the first, although Noah N. clearly places the burden\n\non the Commonwealth to prove by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the continuance is necessary for the juvenile&#x27;s\n\nrehabilitation, the opinion does not suggest that trial evidence\n\ncannot be used to meet the Commonwealth&#x27;s burden.     Nor does Noah\n\nN. stand for the proposition that the Commonwealth must\n\nintroduce evidence of the juvenile&#x27;s need for rehabilitation\n\ntwice:   once at trial, and again at the time of the evidentiary\n\nhearing on the motion to continue.   The circumstances in Noah N.\n\nwere materially different than those presented here.    In Noah\n\nN., the motion to continue was filed pretrial, no evidentiary\n\nproceeding bearing on the juvenile&#x27;s need for rehabilitation had\n\nyet occurred during the case and, as a result, there was no\n\nevidence upon which the judge could have made the required\n\nfindings regarding the need for rehabilitation.   Here, by\n\ncontrast, the motion to continue came directly on the heels of a\n\nbench trial during which ample evidence had been introduced to\n\nsupport the required findings regarding the juvenile&#x27;s need for\n\nrehabilitation.   And, in addition, the judge was the trier of\n\nfact for both the trial and the motion to continue.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\n     As to the second, it is true that the judge did not state\n\nthat she was applying a clear and convincing standard in\n\nassessing the juvenile&#x27;s need for rehabilitation.9   We have\n\naccordingly considered whether the matter should be remanded,\n\nbecause it is ordinarily for the trial court judge to make such\n\na determination in the first instance -- not us.10   Cf.

Importantly, the juvenile does not contend\n\nthat any of the judge&#x27;s extensive and detailed subsidiary\n\nfindings made in connection with the motion to continue is\n\nclearly erroneous.   Nor does the juvenile challenge the\n\nsubsidiary findings underlying the adjudication of delinquency\n\nthat, as a matter of law, were required to be made upon proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.

It follows, the juvenile argues,\n\nthat the framework established in Noah N. is in conflict with\n\nApprendi because the juvenile&#x27;s need for rehabilitation should\n\nhave been determined by a jury upon proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.11\n\n     Whatever merit this interesting argument may have, it is\n\nnot for us to decide it.   &quot;[W]e have no power to alter, overrule\n\nor decline to follow the holding of cases the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt has decided.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Dube, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6461950\"><a href=\"/opinion/6587614/commonwealth-v-dube/\">59 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n476</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (2003).   It is for the Supreme Judicial Court to\n\n\n\n\n     11The juvenile does not attempt to explain what\nsignificance, if any, his waiver of trial by jury has on this\nargument. Nor does it appear he has considered whether\nrequiring a jury trial on the question of rehabilitation could\nresult in delay beyond the juvenile&#x27;s eighteenth birthday itself\naffecting the juvenile&#x27;s potential sentence.\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\ndetermine whether Noah N. is in irreconcilable tension with\n\nApprendi, not us.12\n\n     Finally, the juvenile argues that the continuance gave the\n\nCommonwealth a tactical advantage in violation of his due\n\nprocess rights.   The main weakness in this argument is that the\n\njuvenile fails to articulate what tactical advantage the\n\nCommonwealth obtained from the continuance.   Cf. Commonwealth v.\n\nImbruglia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2217696\"><a href=\"/opinion/2217696/commonwealth-v-imbruglia/\">377 Mass. 682</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691 (1979) (pretrial delay\n\nintentionally undertaken to gain tactical advantage is\n\nimpermissible).   The case had already been tried, and the judge\n\nhad already adjudged the juvenile delinquent before the\n\nCommonwealth moved for a continuance.   Furthermore, the juvenile\n\nmisapprehends the purpose of the continuance, which was not to\n\nadvantage the Commonwealth but to help ensure the juvenile&#x27;s\n\nrehabilitation.\n\n     There was no error in the order allowing the motion for a\n\ncontinuance.\n\n                                    Judgment affirmed.\n\n                                    Order allowing motion to\n                                      continue sentencing\n                                      affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     12We requested and received the briefs filed in Noah N.,\nand we note that the Supreme Judicial Court does not appear to\nhave been alerted to the potential interplay between Apprendi\nand the standard for allowing a continuance for the sole purpose\nof extending sentence in a delinquency proceeding.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118381/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/136995/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/802770/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/903985/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2217696/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2924394/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3161886/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3185110/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4372106/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6452291/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6454548/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6454915/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6454937/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6454942/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6459974/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6461950/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7088892/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7089634/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925378/", "id": 9925378, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467540/in-re-william-m-magee/", "cluster_id": 9467540, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467540/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:05:54.843023-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:40:58.463048-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "da7d65d1b63e560d734bdef5641e36df55c0cc3d", "page_count": 13, "download_url": "http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2024/23-0364.B.OPN.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/in_re_william_m._magee.pdf", "plain_text": "FOR IMMEDIATE NEWS RELEASE                                                  NEWS RELEASE #003\n\n\nFROM: CLERK OF SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n\nThe Opinions handed down on the 19th day of January, 2024 are as follows:\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n 2023-B-00364             IN RE: WILLIAM M. MAGEE\n\n                          Public reprimand imposed. See per curiam.\n\n                          Genovese, J., dissents.\n\f                     SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n                                   NO. 2023-B-0364\n\n                         IN RE: WILLIAM M. MAGEE\n\n\n                ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of\n\nDisciplinary Counsel (\u201cODC\u201d) against respondent, William M. Magee, a suspended\n\nattorney.\n\n\n\n                      PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY\n\n      Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review\n\nrespondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of\n\nlaw in Louisiana in 1978.\n\n      In 2018, we considered a disciplinary proceeding involving respondent\u2019s use\n\nof forged quitclaim deeds to obtain ownership of immovable property in St.\n\nTammany Parish belonging to absentee owners. Respondent did not apprise the trial\n\ncourt of these defective deeds at the time he sought declaratory judgments. For this\n\nmisconduct, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for two years. In re:\n\nMagee, 18-0383 (La. 1/30/19), 263 So. 3d 845 (\u201cMagee I\u201d).\n\n      Neither party filed an application for rehearing in Magee I. Accordingly, the\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment became final and effective on February 13, 2019.\n\n      Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at\n\nissue in the instant proceeding.\n\f                            UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n      At the time of the judgment in Magee I, respondent was representing his\n\nlongtime friend, Jerry Dupont, in civil litigation pending in St. Tammany Parish.\n\nState Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dupont Air Conditioning & Heat, Inc., No. 2018-\n\n12767 on the docket of the 22nd JDC, Division \u201cA.\u201d The plaintiff, State Farm,\n\nrepresented by attorney Thomas J. Lutkewitte, filed suit to collect approximately\n\n$14,000 in insurance premiums from Mr. Dupont\u2019s company. On February 7, 2019,\n\nrespondent filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Mr. Dupont. He also\n\nnotified Mr. Lutkewitte of his withdrawal and pending suspension by letter dated the\n\nsame day.\n\n      On February 11, 2019, respondent sent Mr. Lutkewitte a letter via email\n\noffering to settle the Dupont case for $4,000. Another lawyer at Mr. Lutkewitte\u2019s\n\nfirm, Conor Lutkewitte, responded on February 13, 2019 by tendering a counteroffer\n\nof $7,000.\n\n      On February 18, 2019, respondent directed his legal assistant, Marie Clairain-\n\nSavell, to respond to State Farm\u2019s settlement offer with a counteroffer of $5,500.\n\nMs. Clairain-Savell emailed the counteroffer the same day. The signature block on\n\nthe email identified respondent as the author of the email and the corresponding\n\naddress is listed as respondent\u2019s former law office. Opposing counsel did not\n\nrespond to the February 18 email. On February 26, 2019, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent\n\na second email to Conor Lutkewitte asking for a reply to the counteroffer made on\n\nFebruary 18. Again, there was no response to this inquiry.\n\n\n\n                       DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n\n      On February 20, 2019, Thomas Lutkewitte filed a complaint against\n\nrespondent with the ODC. In August 2021, the ODC filed formal charges against\n\nrespondent, alleging that his conduct as set forth above violated Rules 5.5(a)\n\n                                         2\n\f(engaging in the unauthorized practice of law), 5.5(e)(3)(v) (the practice of law\n\nincludes negotiating or transacting any matter for or on behalf of a client with third\n\nparties), and 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct) of the Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct.\n\n       Respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct. He\n\nasserted that his staff\u2019s contact with opposing counsel was \u201cmeant to be completed\n\nbefore the effective date of his suspension\u201d and that \u201cthe short time period thereafter\n\nwhen contact occurred by staff, not Respondent, represents a harmless error.\u201d\n\n       In light of respondent\u2019s answer, the matter proceeded to a formal hearing on\n\nthe merits. Prior to the hearing, the ODC filed a pre-hearing memorandum in which\n\nit suggested that respondent be adjudged guilty of the charged rule violations, but\n\nthat no additional suspension be imposed, inasmuch as respondent had applied for\n\nreinstatement to the practice of law from his suspension in Magee I.1 In his pre-\n\nhearing memorandum, respondent argued that the \u201cisolated incident at issue was not\n\nan unauthorized practice of law,\u201d and therefore that the formal charges should be\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n                                    Formal Hearing\n\n       The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing on February 22, 2022.\n\nBoth respondent and the ODC introduced documentary evidence. The ODC called\n\nthe following witnesses to testify before the hearing committee: Thomas Lutkewitte\n\nand Conor Lutkewitte, State Farm\u2019s counsel in the Dupont case, and Sarah Taylor\n\nBradley, an attorney who leased space in respondent\u2019s law office. Respondent called\n\nhis legal assistant, Marie Clairain-Savell, and his client, Jerry Dupont, to testify; he\n\nalso testified on his own behalf and on cross-examination by the ODC.\n\n\n1\n Respondent filed a petition for reinstatement in July 2021. That proceeding has been stayed\npending the outcome of the instant matter.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                   Hearing Committee Report\n\n        After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nhearing committee made findings of fact, including the following:\n\n        On January 30, 2019, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for\n\ntwo years in Magee I. Respondent and the ODC agreed that February 13, 2019 was\n\nthe last day that respondent could practice law.\n\n        Upon issuance of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent and his legal\n\nassistant began closing his law practice. This included providing notice to clients\n\nand notice to the courts via motions to withdraw.\n\n        At the time of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent was representing\n\nDupont Air Conditioning & Heating Services, LLC in a suit filed by State Farm to\n\nrecover certain insurance premiums. On February 7, 2019, respondent notified his\n\nclient and all counsel in the Dupont case of the suspension order. He also filed an\n\nex parte motion to withdraw as counsel of record, which the trial judge signed on\n\nFebruary 12.2\n\n        On February 7 or shortly thereafter, respondent dictated a letter for Ms.\n\nClairain-Savell to prepare. On February 11, respondent sent the typed letter to\n\nThomas Lutkewitte offering to settle the Dupont case for a payment of $4,000\n\n\u201cwithin one week.\u201d This letter was transmitted through Ms. Clairain-Savell.\n\n        On February 13, the last day that respondent could practice law, Conor\n\nLutkewitte sent an email to respondent at 11:35 a.m. advising that the $4,000 offer\n\nwas rejected and that State Farm would settle for $7,000.\n\n\n\n\n2\n The committee was disturbed that respondent took any action in the Dupont case after he filed\nthe motion to withdraw on February 7, 2019. The committee reasoned that the time between filing\na motion to withdraw and the signing of the order allowing withdrawal \u201cis probably best utilized\nto take minimal steps to protect the client, not take steps that are contrary to the effort to withdraw.\u201d\n[Emphasis in original.] Nevertheless, the committee felt that respondent\u2019s actions taken after\nFebruary 7 but before February 14 were not before it.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f      On February 18, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent the following email to Conor\n\nLutkewitte:\n\n\n              From:              Marie Clairain-Savell [marie@wmageelaw.com]\n              Sent:              Monday, February 18, 2019 2:36 PM\n              To:                'Conor Lutkewitte'\n              Cc:                'William Magee-Business'\n              Subject:           RE: State Farm v.

The committee found this was not plausible, as respondent knew his\n\ndeadline was the same day. No documents, notes, or other emails were supplied in\n\nsupport of this position, and Mr. Dupont was unable to recall the chronology of\n\nevents. The committee found respondent\u2019s account \u201cwas in the nature of a finessed\n\nnarrative instead of simply telling the truth.\u201d\n\n      Ms. Clairain-Savell appeared to be a very diligent and longtime assistant to\n\nrespondent who would promptly attend to her work. She understood that she had to\n\nfollow the lead of the attorney and that she could not negotiate. She testified that\n\nthe substance of the February 18 email was captured by her from an email from\n\nrespondent and that she forwarded it to Conor Lutkewitte at respondent\u2019s direction.\n\nShe had concerns about doing this, but respondent said it was okay since it was\n\ncoming from her.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f      The committee concluded that a rational evaluation of these facts leads to the\n\nconclusion that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont after February 13 to\n\ndiscuss a counteroffer and that respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell an email on\n\nFebruary 18 which she captured in the email that then followed to Conor Lutkewitte.\n\nIf respondent had been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending deadline, he would have called Conor Lutkewitte or sent him an email\n\nimmediately. The committee found these actions by respondent were an effort to\n\ncircumvent the order of suspension in Magee I.\n\n      The February 26 email to Conor Lutkewitte was sent by Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\nwithout direction from respondent.\n\n      Based on these facts, the committee determined that respondent violated the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The committee determined respondent violated duties owed to the public and\n\nthe legal profession. In contravention of his suspension order, respondent knowingly\n\nand intentionally took actions that constitute the practice of law. The committee\n\nnoted that respondent led a client and an employee to believe that it is \u201cokay to do\n\nsomething circuitously that could not be done directly.\u201d The committee commented\n\nthat a lawyer with respondent\u2019s years of experience knows that such conduct is not\n\nacceptable. There was no evidence that respondent\u2019s misconduct caused actual harm\n\nto his client, but there was injury to the profession and the legal system in that\n\nrespondent flouted the rules of the profession in the face of an order of suspension.\n\nBased on the ABA\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee\n\ndetermined the baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The committee determined the following aggravating factors are present: a\n\nprior disciplinary record, deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fto acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, 3 and substantial experience in\n\nthe practice of law. The committee determined the only mitigating factor present is\n\nthe absence of a dishonest or selfish motive.\n\n       Based on these findings, and considering the prior jurisprudence dealing with\n\nsimilar conduct, the committee concluded that respondent\u2019s misconduct involved \u201ca\n\nsingle incident which was undertaken with incredibly poor judgment.\u201d Accordingly,\n\nthe committee recommended respondent be publicly reprimanded and be required to\n\nattend Ethics School. The committee also recommended that respondent be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this proceeding.\n\n       Respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee\u2019s report.\n\n\n\n                          Disciplinary Board Recommendation\n\n       After review, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee\u2019s\n\nfactual findings are not manifestly erroneous and adopted same, with minor\n\nclarifications.\n\n       First, the board clarified that respondent telephoned Mr. Dupont on February\n\n13, 2019 after receiving the email from Conor Lutkewitte; he did not indicate in his\n\ntestimony that he actually met in person with Mr. Dupont on that date. Second, at\n\nthe hearing respondent changed his testimony from his sworn statement concerning\n\nhow he asked Ms. Clairain-Savell to relay Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer to\n\nConor Lutkewitte. At his sworn statement, respondent testified that on February 13,\n\n2019, he dictated instructions to Ms. Clairain-Savell to send what later became the\n\nFebruary 18 email to Conor Lutkewitte. At the hearing, respondent instead asserted\n\nthat he personally told Ms. Clairain-Savell to send the counteroffer by email, and he\n\nassumed this happened on February 13, but was not sure of this date. The board\n\n3\n  The committee was troubled by respondent\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cways he felt he could still\nperform the actions of a lawyer through mediation or through a power of attorney,\u201d and commented\nthat \u201cthese are not tools to practice law without a license.\u201d\n\n                                               7\n\ffound that neither of these clarifications affect the committee\u2019s subsequent findings\n\nthat (1) it was not plausible that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont on\n\nFebruary 13; and (2) it was not plausible that respondent relayed Mr. Dupont\u2019s\n\nsettlement counteroffer to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 13 in order for her to\n\nforward it by email to Conor Lutkewitte. As determined by the committee, had\n\nrespondent been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending suspension, he would have immediately called Conor Lutkewitte or made\n\ncertain that an email was sent to him that day. Moreover, the board noted that while\n\nrespondent asserted at the hearing that he told Ms. Clairain-Savell what information\n\nto include in the February 18 email sent to Conor Lutkewitte, Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\ntestified that she captured the substance of the February 18 email from an email sent\n\nto her by respondent, and she then sent it to Conor Lutkewitte. The board found that\n\nwhile the evidence could support a conclusion that anytime between February 14\n\nthrough February 18 respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email containing Mr.\n\nDupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, the conclusion drawn by the committee that\n\nrespondent sent the email to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 18 is also a permissible\n\nview of the evidence. In a civil context where the fact finder is presented with two\n\npermissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them is not\n\nclearly wrong. Accordingly, the board specifically adopted the committee\u2019s factual\n\nfinding that on February 18, respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email\n\ncontaining Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, which she was directed to forward\n\nto Conor Lutkewitte.\n\n      Based on these factual findings, the board determined respondent\u2019s conduct\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his client and to the\n\nlegal profession. His actions were knowing and intentional. There is no evidence\n\nthat respondent\u2019s conduct caused actual harm to Mr. Dupont, but potential harm to\n\n                                         8\n\fMr. Dupont was present in that had Mr. Lutkewitte negotiated a settlement with\n\nrespondent not knowing he was suspended, the settlement could later have been\n\nquestioned. The profession has been harmed, as respondent has flouted the authority\n\nof the court by practicing while suspended. Based on the ABA\u2019s Standards for\n\nImposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline sanction is\n\nsuspension. The board agreed with the aggravating and mitigating factors found by\n\nthe committee.\n\n      Considering these findings, the court\u2019s prior jurisprudence discussing similar\n\nmisconduct, and the totality of respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board recommended\n\nrespondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, with this suspension\n\nto run consecutively to respondent\u2019s suspension imposed in Magee I. The board\n\nfurther recommended that respondent attend Ethics School and that he be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this matter.\n\n      Respondent filed an objection to the board\u2019s recommendation. Accordingly,\n\nthe case was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, \u00a7\n\n11(G)(1)(b).\n\n\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n      Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La.\n\nConst. art. V, \u00a7 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an\n\nindependent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has\n\nbeen proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re: Banks, 09-1212 (La. 10/2/09),\n\n18 So. 3d 57.      While we are not bound in any way by the findings and\n\nrecommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the\n\nmanifest error standard is applicable to the committee\u2019s factual findings. See In re:\n\nCaulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), 683 So. 2d 714; In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La.\n\n3/11/94), 633 So. 2d 150.\n\n                                          9\n\f      The record establishes by clear and convincing evidence that on February 18,\n\n2019, respondent directed his legal assistant to send a settlement counteroffer to\n\nopposing counsel. As this conduct occurred after the effective date of respondent\u2019s\n\nsuspension in Magee I, it constitutes the unauthorized practice of law and therefore\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges.\n\n      Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a\n\ndetermination of the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s actions. In determining\n\na sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain\n\nhigh standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession,\n\nand deter future misconduct. Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Reis, 513 So. 2d 1173\n\n(La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and\n\nthe seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d 520\n\n(La. 1984).\n\n      Respondent violated duties owed to his client and the legal profession. His\n\nactions were knowing and intentional, causing actual and potential harm. The\n\napplicable baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The following aggravating factors are present: a prior disciplinary record,\n\ndeceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the\n\nwrongful nature of the conduct, and substantial experience in the practice of law.\n\n      However, the record also supports a finding of significant mitigating factors.\n\nIn addition to respondent\u2019s lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, we place emphasis\n\non the mitigating effect of the ODC\u2019s considerable delay in instituting disciplinary\n\ncharges in this matter. The record reveals the ODC became aware of the misconduct\n\nin early 2019 when it received the complaint from Mr. Lutkewitte, but did not\n\ninstitute formal charges until August 2021. Notably, these charges were filed\n\napproximately one month after respondent filed an application for reinstatement\n\n                                          10\n\ffrom his suspension in Magee I, and the ODC relied on these charges as a basis to\n\nseek and obtain a stay from the hearing committee considering respondent\u2019s\n\napplication for reinstatement.\n\n      We have recognized that \u201c[s]ome delay in disciplinary proceedings is inherent\n\nin the process.\u201d Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Causey, 393 So. 2d 88, 93 (La. 1980).\n\nHowever, when the delay results in prejudice to the respondent, it may be considered\n\na mitigating factor which bears on the severity of the discipline to be imposed. See\n\nIn re: Huddleston, 595 So. 2d 1141, 1148 (La. 1992). While we do not find sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to conclude the ODC\u2019s delay in instituting charges was\n\nintentional, we believe the timing caused prejudice to respondent by delaying his\n\nability to seek reinstatement from his earlier suspension.\n\n      Under these specific facts, any additional period of suspension would be\n\nunduly punitive. We find respondent\u2019s misconduct is adequately addressed by a\n\npublic reprimand.\n\n      In light of this sanction, we find there is no reason for any further delay in the\n\nconsideration of respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement. Accordingly, without\n\nexpressing any opinion on the merits of the application for reinstatement, we\n\nexercise our plenary original jurisdiction to direct the hearing committee to lift its\n\nstay and consider the application for reinstatement in an expeditious manner.\n\n\n\n                                      DECREE\n\n      Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee\n\nand the disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it\n\nis ordered that William M. Magee, Louisiana Bar Roll number 8859, be and he\n\nhereby is publicly reprimanded. It is further ordered that any stay of consideration\n\nof respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement from his prior suspension be\n\nimmediately lifted.   All costs and expenses in the matter of this disciplinary\n\n                                          11\n\fproceeding are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule\n\nXIX, \u00a7 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of\n\nthis court\u2019s judgment until paid.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">FOR IMMEDIATE NEWS RELEASE                                                  NEWS RELEASE #003\n\n\nFROM: CLERK OF SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n\nThe Opinions handed down on the 19th day of January, 2024 are as follows:\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n 2023-B-00364             IN RE: WILLIAM M.

Magee, a suspended\n\nattorney.\n\n\n\n                      PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY\n\n      Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review\n\nrespondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of\n\nlaw in Louisiana in 1978.\n\n      In 2018, we considered a disciplinary proceeding involving respondent\u2019s use\n\nof forged quitclaim deeds to obtain ownership of immovable property in St.\n\nTammany Parish belonging to absentee owners. Respondent did not apprise the trial\n\ncourt of these defective deeds at the time he sought declaratory judgments. For this\n\nmisconduct, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for two years. In re:\n\nMagee, 18-0383 (La. 1/30/19), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4363122\"><a href=\"/opinion/4585869/in-re-william-magee/\">263 So. 3d 845</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (\u201cMagee I\u201d).\n\n      Neither party filed an application for rehearing in Magee I. Accordingly, the\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment became final and effective on February 13, 2019.\n\n      Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at\n\nissue in the instant proceeding.\n\f                            UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n      At the time of the judgment in Magee I, respondent was representing his\n\nlongtime friend, Jerry Dupont, in civil litigation pending in St. Tammany Parish.\n\nState Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dupont Air Conditioning &amp; Heat, Inc., No. 2018-\n\n12767 on the docket of the 22nd JDC, Division \u201cA.\u201d The plaintiff, State Farm,\n\nrepresented by attorney Thomas J. Lutkewitte, filed suit to collect approximately\n\n$14,000 in insurance premiums from Mr. Dupont\u2019s company. On February 7, 2019,\n\nrespondent filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Mr. Dupont. He also\n\nnotified Mr. Lutkewitte of his withdrawal and pending suspension by letter dated the\n\nsame day.\n\n      On February 11, 2019, respondent sent Mr. Lutkewitte a letter via email\n\noffering to settle the Dupont case for $4,000. Another lawyer at Mr. Lutkewitte\u2019s\n\nfirm, Conor Lutkewitte, responded on February 13, 2019 by tendering a counteroffer\n\nof $7,000.\n\n      On February 18, 2019, respondent directed his legal assistant, Marie Clairain-\n\nSavell, to respond to State Farm\u2019s settlement offer with a counteroffer of $5,500.\n\nMs. Clairain-Savell emailed the counteroffer the same day. The signature block on\n\nthe email identified respondent as the author of the email and the corresponding\n\naddress is listed as respondent\u2019s former law office. Opposing counsel did not\n\nrespond to the February 18 email. On February 26, 2019, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent\n\na second email to Conor Lutkewitte asking for a reply to the counteroffer made on\n\nFebruary 18. Again, there was no response to this inquiry.\n\n\n\n                       DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n\n      On February 20, 2019, Thomas Lutkewitte filed a complaint against\n\nrespondent with the ODC. In August 2021, the ODC filed formal charges against\n\nrespondent, alleging that his conduct as set forth above violated Rules 5.5(a)\n\n                                         2\n\f(engaging in the unauthorized practice of law), 5.5(e)(3)(v) (the practice of law\n\nincludes negotiating or transacting any matter for or on behalf of a client with third\n\nparties), and 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct) of the Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct.\n\n       Respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct. He\n\nasserted that his staff\u2019s contact with opposing counsel was \u201cmeant to be completed\n\nbefore the effective date of his suspension\u201d and that \u201cthe short time period thereafter\n\nwhen contact occurred by staff, not Respondent, represents a harmless error.\u201d\n\n       In light of respondent\u2019s answer, the matter proceeded to a formal hearing on\n\nthe merits. Prior to the hearing, the ODC filed a pre-hearing memorandum in which\n\nit suggested that respondent be adjudged guilty of the charged rule violations, but\n\nthat no additional suspension be imposed, inasmuch as respondent had applied for\n\nreinstatement to the practice of law from his suspension in Magee I.1 In his pre-\n\nhearing memorandum, respondent argued that the \u201cisolated incident at issue was not\n\nan unauthorized practice of law,\u201d and therefore that the formal charges should be\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n                                    Formal Hearing\n\n       The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing on February 22, 2022.\n\nBoth respondent and the ODC introduced documentary evidence. The ODC called\n\nthe following witnesses to testify before the hearing committee: Thomas Lutkewitte\n\nand Conor Lutkewitte, State Farm\u2019s counsel in the Dupont case, and Sarah Taylor\n\nBradley, an attorney who leased space in respondent\u2019s law office. Respondent called\n\nhis legal assistant, Marie Clairain-Savell, and his client, Jerry Dupont, to testify; he\n\nalso testified on his own behalf and on cross-examination by the ODC.\n\n\n1\n Respondent filed a petition for reinstatement in July 2021. That proceeding has been stayed\npending the outcome of the instant matter.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                   Hearing Committee Report\n\n        After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nhearing committee made findings of fact, including the following:\n\n        On January 30, 2019, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for\n\ntwo years in Magee I. Respondent and the ODC agreed that February 13, 2019 was\n\nthe last day that respondent could practice law.\n\n        Upon issuance of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent and his legal\n\nassistant began closing his law practice. This included providing notice to clients\n\nand notice to the courts via motions to withdraw.\n\n        At the time of the court\u2019s order in Magee I, respondent was representing\n\nDupont Air Conditioning &amp; Heating Services, LLC in a suit filed by State Farm to\n\nrecover certain insurance premiums. On February 7, 2019, respondent notified his\n\nclient and all counsel in the Dupont case of the suspension order. He also filed an\n\nex parte motion to withdraw as counsel of record, which the trial judge signed on\n\nFebruary 12.2\n\n        On February 7 or shortly thereafter, respondent dictated a letter for Ms.\n\nClairain-Savell to prepare. On February 11, respondent sent the typed letter to\n\nThomas Lutkewitte offering to settle the Dupont case for a payment of $4,000\n\n\u201cwithin one week.\u201d This letter was transmitted through Ms. Clairain-Savell.\n\n        On February 13, the last day that respondent could practice law, Conor\n\nLutkewitte sent an email to respondent at 11:35 a.m. advising that the $4,000 offer\n\nwas rejected and that State Farm would settle for $7,000.\n\n\n\n\n2\n The committee was disturbed that respondent took any action in the Dupont case after he filed\nthe motion to withdraw on February 7, 2019. The committee reasoned that the time between filing\na motion to withdraw and the signing of the order allowing withdrawal \u201cis probably best utilized\nto take minimal steps to protect the client, not take steps that are contrary to the effort to withdraw.\u201d\n[Emphasis in original.] Nevertheless, the committee felt that respondent\u2019s actions taken after\nFebruary 7 but before February 14 were not before it.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f      On February 18, Ms. Clairain-Savell sent the following email to Conor\n\nLutkewitte:\n\n\n              From:              Marie Clairain-Savell [marie@wmageelaw.com]\n              Sent:              Monday, February 18, 2019 2:36 PM\n              To:                &#x27;Conor Lutkewitte&#x27;\n              Cc:                &#x27;William Magee-Business&#x27;\n              Subject:           RE: State Farm v.

The committee found this was not plausible, as respondent knew his\n\ndeadline was the same day. No documents, notes, or other emails were supplied in\n\nsupport of this position, and Mr. Dupont was unable to recall the chronology of\n\nevents. The committee found respondent\u2019s account \u201cwas in the nature of a finessed\n\nnarrative instead of simply telling the truth.\u201d\n\n      Ms. Clairain-Savell appeared to be a very diligent and longtime assistant to\n\nrespondent who would promptly attend to her work. She understood that she had to\n\nfollow the lead of the attorney and that she could not negotiate. She testified that\n\nthe substance of the February 18 email was captured by her from an email from\n\nrespondent and that she forwarded it to Conor Lutkewitte at respondent\u2019s direction.\n\nShe had concerns about doing this, but respondent said it was okay since it was\n\ncoming from her.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f      The committee concluded that a rational evaluation of these facts leads to the\n\nconclusion that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont after February 13 to\n\ndiscuss a counteroffer and that respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell an email on\n\nFebruary 18 which she captured in the email that then followed to Conor Lutkewitte.\n\nIf respondent had been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending deadline, he would have called Conor Lutkewitte or sent him an email\n\nimmediately. The committee found these actions by respondent were an effort to\n\ncircumvent the order of suspension in Magee I.\n\n      The February 26 email to Conor Lutkewitte was sent by Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\nwithout direction from respondent.\n\n      Based on these facts, the committee determined that respondent violated the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The committee determined respondent violated duties owed to the public and\n\nthe legal profession. In contravention of his suspension order, respondent knowingly\n\nand intentionally took actions that constitute the practice of law. The committee\n\nnoted that respondent led a client and an employee to believe that it is \u201cokay to do\n\nsomething circuitously that could not be done directly.\u201d The committee commented\n\nthat a lawyer with respondent\u2019s years of experience knows that such conduct is not\n\nacceptable. There was no evidence that respondent\u2019s misconduct caused actual harm\n\nto his client, but there was injury to the profession and the legal system in that\n\nrespondent flouted the rules of the profession in the face of an order of suspension.\n\nBased on the ABA\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee\n\ndetermined the baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The committee determined the following aggravating factors are present: a\n\nprior disciplinary record, deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fto acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, 3 and substantial experience in\n\nthe practice of law. The committee determined the only mitigating factor present is\n\nthe absence of a dishonest or selfish motive.\n\n       Based on these findings, and considering the prior jurisprudence dealing with\n\nsimilar conduct, the committee concluded that respondent\u2019s misconduct involved \u201ca\n\nsingle incident which was undertaken with incredibly poor judgment.\u201d Accordingly,\n\nthe committee recommended respondent be publicly reprimanded and be required to\n\nattend Ethics School. The committee also recommended that respondent be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this proceeding.\n\n       Respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee\u2019s report.\n\n\n\n                          Disciplinary Board Recommendation\n\n       After review, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee\u2019s\n\nfactual findings are not manifestly erroneous and adopted same, with minor\n\nclarifications.\n\n       First, the board clarified that respondent telephoned Mr. Dupont on February\n\n13, 2019 after receiving the email from Conor Lutkewitte; he did not indicate in his\n\ntestimony that he actually met in person with Mr. Dupont on that date. Second, at\n\nthe hearing respondent changed his testimony from his sworn statement concerning\n\nhow he asked Ms. Clairain-Savell to relay Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer to\n\nConor Lutkewitte. At his sworn statement, respondent testified that on February 13,\n\n2019, he dictated instructions to Ms. Clairain-Savell to send what later became the\n\nFebruary 18 email to Conor Lutkewitte. At the hearing, respondent instead asserted\n\nthat he personally told Ms. Clairain-Savell to send the counteroffer by email, and he\n\nassumed this happened on February 13, but was not sure of this date. The board\n\n3\n  The committee was troubled by respondent\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cways he felt he could still\nperform the actions of a lawyer through mediation or through a power of attorney,\u201d and commented\nthat \u201cthese are not tools to practice law without a license.\u201d\n\n                                               7\n\ffound that neither of these clarifications affect the committee\u2019s subsequent findings\n\nthat (1) it was not plausible that respondent was in contact with Mr. Dupont on\n\nFebruary 13; and (2) it was not plausible that respondent relayed Mr. Dupont\u2019s\n\nsettlement counteroffer to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 13 in order for her to\n\nforward it by email to Conor Lutkewitte. As determined by the committee, had\n\nrespondent been in contact with Mr. Dupont on February 13, in the face of his\n\nimpending suspension, he would have immediately called Conor Lutkewitte or made\n\ncertain that an email was sent to him that day. Moreover, the board noted that while\n\nrespondent asserted at the hearing that he told Ms. Clairain-Savell what information\n\nto include in the February 18 email sent to Conor Lutkewitte, Ms. Clairain-Savell\n\ntestified that she captured the substance of the February 18 email from an email sent\n\nto her by respondent, and she then sent it to Conor Lutkewitte. The board found that\n\nwhile the evidence could support a conclusion that anytime between February 14\n\nthrough February 18 respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email containing Mr.\n\nDupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, the conclusion drawn by the committee that\n\nrespondent sent the email to Ms. Clairain-Savell on February 18 is also a permissible\n\nview of the evidence. In a civil context where the fact finder is presented with two\n\npermissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them is not\n\nclearly wrong. Accordingly, the board specifically adopted the committee\u2019s factual\n\nfinding that on February 18, respondent sent Ms. Clairain-Savell the email\n\ncontaining Mr. Dupont\u2019s settlement counteroffer, which she was directed to forward\n\nto Conor Lutkewitte.\n\n      Based on these factual findings, the board determined respondent\u2019s conduct\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.\n\n      The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his client and to the\n\nlegal profession. His actions were knowing and intentional. There is no evidence\n\nthat respondent\u2019s conduct caused actual harm to Mr. Dupont, but potential harm to\n\n                                         8\n\fMr. Dupont was present in that had Mr. Lutkewitte negotiated a settlement with\n\nrespondent not knowing he was suspended, the settlement could later have been\n\nquestioned. The profession has been harmed, as respondent has flouted the authority\n\nof the court by practicing while suspended. Based on the ABA\u2019s Standards for\n\nImposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline sanction is\n\nsuspension. The board agreed with the aggravating and mitigating factors found by\n\nthe committee.\n\n      Considering these findings, the court\u2019s prior jurisprudence discussing similar\n\nmisconduct, and the totality of respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board recommended\n\nrespondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, with this suspension\n\nto run consecutively to respondent\u2019s suspension imposed in Magee I. The board\n\nfurther recommended that respondent attend Ethics School and that he be assessed\n\nwith the costs and expenses of this matter.\n\n      Respondent filed an objection to the board\u2019s recommendation. Accordingly,\n\nthe case was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, \u00a7\n\n11(G)(1)(b).\n\n\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n      Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court.

As this conduct occurred after the effective date of respondent\u2019s\n\nsuspension in Magee I, it constitutes the unauthorized practice of law and therefore\n\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges.\n\n      Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a\n\ndetermination of the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s actions. In determining\n\na sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain\n\nhigh standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession,\n\nand deter future misconduct.

His\n\nactions were knowing and intentional, causing actual and potential harm. The\n\napplicable baseline sanction is suspension.\n\n      The following aggravating factors are present: a prior disciplinary record,\n\ndeceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the\n\nwrongful nature of the conduct, and substantial experience in the practice of law.\n\n      However, the record also supports a finding of significant mitigating factors.\n\nIn addition to respondent\u2019s lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, we place emphasis\n\non the mitigating effect of the ODC\u2019s considerable delay in instituting disciplinary\n\ncharges in this matter. The record reveals the ODC became aware of the misconduct\n\nin early 2019 when it received the complaint from Mr. Lutkewitte, but did not\n\ninstitute formal charges until August 2021. Notably, these charges were filed\n\napproximately one month after respondent filed an application for reinstatement\n\n                                          10\n\ffrom his suspension in Magee I, and the ODC relied on these charges as a basis to\n\nseek and obtain a stay from the hearing committee considering respondent\u2019s\n\napplication for reinstatement.\n\n      We have recognized that \u201c[s]ome delay in disciplinary proceedings is inherent\n\nin the process.\u201d Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v.

See\n\nIn re: Huddleston, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">595 So. 2d 1141</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1148 (La. 1992). While we do not find sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to conclude the ODC\u2019s delay in instituting charges was\n\nintentional, we believe the timing caused prejudice to respondent by delaying his\n\nability to seek reinstatement from his earlier suspension.\n\n      Under these specific facts, any additional period of suspension would be\n\nunduly punitive. We find respondent\u2019s misconduct is adequately addressed by a\n\npublic reprimand.\n\n      In light of this sanction, we find there is no reason for any further delay in the\n\nconsideration of respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement. Accordingly, without\n\nexpressing any opinion on the merits of the application for reinstatement, we\n\nexercise our plenary original jurisdiction to direct the hearing committee to lift its\n\nstay and consider the application for reinstatement in an expeditious manner.\n\n\n\n                                      DECREE\n\n      Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee\n\nand the disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it\n\nis ordered that William M.

The\ndistrict court eventually granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that the\nCity\u2014and not Clark\u2014owned the property. Clark appeals. After carefully considering the\nparties' arguments and the record before us, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The central question in this case is who owns two tracts of land adjacent to Dane\nAvenue, which was formerly Kansas Highway 273 (or K-273), in Williamsburg. In 1970\nand 1972, Darreld and Helen Goodwill deeded two plots of land\u2014consisting of .23 acres\nand .26 acres, respectively\u2014to the Kansas Highway Commission. Each deed, titled a\n\"Deed for Highway Purposes,\" transferred \"fee simple\" rights to the land to the\nCommission but retained interests in the oil, gas, and mineral rights.\n\n\n       In September 2002, the City of Williamsburg annexed all of K-273 in Franklin\nCounty from the State. Later that month, the Secretary of Transportation adopted a\nresolution removing K-273 from the state highway system, stating \"the existing road shall\nrevert to local public authority.\" And in November 2002, the State issued a quitclaim\ndeed to the City for various tracts of land in Franklin County. This deed explicitly\nreferenced the .26 acres of land transferred to the State in 1972 by the Goodwills but did\nnot mention the .23 acres transferred in 1970.\n\n\n       Meanwhile, the Goodwills sold their remaining property. In 2003, Clark bought\nthat remaining property from the Goodwills' successors in interest. Clark's deed stated\nthat he was receiving the land that used to belong to the Goodwills \"except [for the] land\ndeeded for highway [purposes].\"\n\n\n       In June 2020, the City's mayor, Stover, was mowing grass next to Dane Avenue in\nWilliamsburg on land Clark believed was his. Stover apparently damaged trees, flowers,\nand electrical supply lines. Clark asked city officials to acknowledge that he owned the\nland, and when they refused, he filed this quiet-title action to determine the land's\nownership.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       In the lawsuit, Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the two tracts\nand that the City only held a 20-foot easement from the centerline of Dane Avenue. He\nalso sought damages for the harm Stover caused when he mowed the land. The City\nresponded that it owned the two tracts of land in fee simple. It asserted that it had\nacquired the land from the State when the State removed the K-273 from the state\nhighway system and issued the quitclaim deed to the City. The City also argued that if it\ndid indeed only hold an easement on the land, the easement ran 30 feet from the\ncenterline of Dane Avenue, not 20 feet like Clark claimed.\n\n\n       The case proceeded through discovery, and both parties eventually moved for\nsummary judgment. Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the land and\ndamages for a trespass against chattels claim against Stover, and the City sought the\nopposite\u2014a declaratory judgment that it owned the land and a dismissal of all Clark's\nother claims.\n\n\n       The district court held a hearing on the opposing motions. At the hearing, Clark\nsuggested that the district court only decide who owned the land and allow him to appeal\nthat ruling, leaving the trespass question for another day. The City did not oppose this\nprocedure.\n\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment for the City. The court found that the\nCity, and not Clark, owned the two tracts of land in fee simple, though Clark retained the\nmineral rights (a matter neither party contested). The court also found that the City had a\n30-foot right-of-way on either side of the centerline of Dane Avenue. The court reserved\nruling on Clark's trespass claim. Clark appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n        Clark challenges both rulings by the district court. He claims the court erred when\nit found that the City, not Clark, owns the two tracts of land adjacent to Dane Avenue.\nAnd he asserts that the court erred when it found that the City had a 30-foot right-of-way,\nnot a 20-foot right-of-way, from the centerline of Dane Avenue. The City urges us to\naffirm both rulings.\n\n\n        We note that although the parties and the district court treated these questions\nindependently, they are in essence swallowed by Clark's quiet-title claim. The two tracts\nof land\u2014which we refer to as the 1970 tract and the 1972 tract\u2014are adjacent to the road\nand thus include the contested right-of-way. The extent of the City's right-of-way would\nonly become important if we were to conclude that Clark owned the 1970 or 1972 tract.\nBut we agree with the district court that Clark does not own that property; the Goodwills\ntransferred that property in fee simple to the State more than 50 years ago. Thus, the\nGoodwills and their successors could not have transferred that same property to Clark in\n2003. As we explain more fully below, we affirm the court's judgment in favor of the\nCity.\n\n\n   1. This court has jurisdiction to consider Clark's appeal.\n\n        Before considering the merits of the parties' arguments, we pause to address a\nprocedural question concerning our authority to hear this appeal. As we have indicated,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to the City on most of the claims in the case\n(those relating to the ownership of the property and the extent of the City's right-of-way),\nbut it did not rule on Clark's trespass claim. The court's journal entry of judgment\ncertified the ownership and right-of-way decisions for interlocutory appeal under K.S.A.\n60-2102(c). Clark, however, did not file an application for interlocutory appeal with this\ncourt within 14 days, as that provision requires. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 60-2102(c).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fInstead, he filed a notice of appeal with the district court and docketed the appeal with the\nCourt of Appeals in the ordinary fashion a few weeks later.\n\n\n       Most cases that come before us in this manner are final judgments\u2014judgments\nthat dispose entirely of the merits of the claims in a case\u2014appealable under K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 60-2102(a)(4). Accord Honeycutt v. City of Wichita, 251 Kan. 451, Syl. \u00b6 1, 836\nP.2d 1128 (1992) (\"A final decision is one that finally decides and disposes of the entire\nmerits of the controversy and reserves no further questions or directions for the future or\nfurther action of the court.\"). This is important because the right to appeal is a statutory\none; Kansas appellate courts only have jurisdiction to hear an appeal if Kansas statutes\nallow it. In re T.S., 308 Kan. 306, 309, 419 P.3d 1159 (2018). Both parties agree that the\ndistrict court's decision that Clark appeals is not a final judgment, as the district court did\nnot rule on Clark's trespass claim. This court thus ordered the parties to brief why this\ncourt has jurisdiction to hear this appeal before the trespass claim has been resolved.\n\n\n       In his response, Clark points out that we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal\nunder K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 60-2102(a)(3)\u2014a statute that allows parties to appeal from \"an\norder involving . . . the title to real estate.\" To invoke this statute, the order affecting real\nestate must have \"some semblance of finality.\" In re Austin, 200 Kan. 92, 94, 435 P.2d 1\n(1967); Cusintz v. Cusintz, 195 Kan. 301, 302, 404 P.2d 164 (1965). We agree with the\nparties that the district court's decision that Clark does not own the two tracts of land in\nquestion carries the finality required to proceed on appeal. We therefore turn to the\ndistrict court's summary-judgment ruling.\n\n\n   2. The district court correctly held that Clark does not own the land in question.\n\n       Clark challenges the district court's ruling that he does not own the 1970 and 1972\ntracts in two main ways. He asserts that the court erred when it found that the Goodwills\ntransferred that land in fee simple; he points out that although the language of the 1970\n\n\n                                                5\n\fand 1972 deeds include phrases Kansas courts have typically found to create fee-simple\ngrants, those deeds state the transfer was \"for Highway Purposes.\" He also points out that\nthe State's quitclaim deed in 2002 made no reference to the 1970 tract; he argues that this,\nat the very least, leaves a factual question as to who owns that property. Kansas caselaw\nundermines both assertions.\n\n\n       Clark first argues that the 1970 and 1972 deeds created a limited transfer for\nhighway purposes. In doing so, Clark acknowledges that the Goodwills transferred some\ninterest in the two tracts of land to the State in 1970 and 1972, and those deeds stated\nthey were transferring the land in fee simple. But he claims the deeds' reference to the\nland's usage for highway purposes limited the nature of the transfer, and ownership of the\nproperty reverted to him (or to his predecessors in interest) when the State ceased using\nK-273 as a state highway in 2002.\n\n\n       The basis for this assertion requires a bit more development. As we have\nmentioned, the 1970 and 1972 deeds from the Goodwills to the State were each titled as a\n\"Deed for Highway Purposes.\" Each deed contained identical operative language, stating\nthe deed transferred the respective tract of land to the State\n\n\n       \"(excepting the oil and gas minerals under or in said lands) . . . together with all and\n       singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtances thereto belonging or in any wise\n       appertaining, forever. It is understood and agreed that [the State] is acquiring said real\n       estate for state highway purposes.\n               \"And [the Goodwills] do hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with [the\n       State] that at delivery of these presents they are lawfully seized of an estate in fee simple\n       in all and singular the above granted and described premises with the appurtenances\n       thereto, except for the right of way of any existing public highway thereon; that the same\n       are free and clear of and from all and every incumbrance whatsoever, . . . and that they\n       will forever warrant and defend the same unto [the State] or its assigns forever, against all\n       and any lawful claim of all and any persons whomsoever.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n\f       Clark correctly points out that the plain language of these deeds indicated that they\nwere transferring the land for highway purposes. He thus argues that the deeds created a\nlimited transfer\u2014a fee simple determinable interest in the land\u2014that would\nautomatically revert to the grantor when a specific condition ceases to occur. So, Clark\ncontends, these tracts automatically reverted to the previous owner of his property in\n2002 when Dane Avenue was no longer used for highway purposes as K-273.\n\n\n       We disagree. Kansas courts have consistently interpreted similar language in\ndeeds as transferring land in fee simple without any reversion. More than 40 years ago,\nthe Kansas Supreme Court observed that it is \"well settled that the mere expression that\nproperty is to be used for a particular purpose will not in and of itself suffice to turn a fee\nsimple into a determinable fee.\" Roberts v. Rhodes, 231 Kan. 74, 77, 643 P.2d 116\n(1982).\n\n\n       The court's decision in Roberts illustrates this principle. There, previous property\nowners had transferred land to a school district in 1902 and 1908. Both deeds essentially\nstated that the property was being transferred \"'only for school or cemetery purposes.'\"\n231 Kan. at 75. The land was then used for school purposes for more than 60 years, until\nthe school district sold the land in 1971. The successor to the original property owners,\nRoberts, challenged the person who had received title from the school district, Rhodes,\nclaiming the land should revert to Roberts when it ceased being used for school purposes.\n\n\n       On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged the difficulty of interpreting\nthese deeds when the parties did not \"provide for what should happen to the land after it\nhas been used for school purposes for sixty years and then is no longer needed for such\npurpose.\" 231 Kan. at 76. But our Supreme Court found that despite the language in the\n1902 and 1908 deeds regarding the intended use of the property, \"neither deed made\nprovision for the estate to revert or terminate\" if the land ceased being used for that\npurpose. 231 Kan. at 76. Without any explicit language indicating a reversion, the court\n\n\n                                               7\n\fheld that the 1902 and 1908 deeds had transferred title in fee simple, not fee simple\ndeterminable. 231 Kan. at 80.\n\n\n       As this discussion highlights, it has long been the law in this state that a deed must\nclearly and explicitly reserve a reversionary interest in the grantor to create a fee simple\ndeterminable interest. Kinney v. State, 238 Kan. 375, 380, 710 P.2d 1290 (1985). The\n1970 and 1972 deeds at issue in this case did not do that. Instead, they transferred the\nland to the State in fee simple without restriction, reserving for the Goodwills only the\noil, gas, and mineral interests. Thus, the district court correctly found that, despite the\nlanguage signifying the Goodwills' present intent, the 1970 and 1972 deeds transferred\nunlimited, fee simple ownership of the two tracts of land to the State.\n\n\n       Clark next asserts that, even if the Goodwills' transfer to the State was not limited\nto using the land as a state highway, the district court erred when it found at summary\njudgment that the City now owns that property. Clark argues that there is a factual\nquestion as to whether the City ever received title to the 1970 tract, as it was not\nexplicitly described in the quitclaim deed the State provided to the City when it\ntransferred the property in 2002.\n\n\n       Quitclaim deeds often are less than precise, and the 2002 quitclaim deed from the\nState to the City here is no different. The 2002 quitclaim deed does indicate that the State\nis transferring all property previously surrounding K-273 in Franklin County to the City.\nThis would appear to include the 1970 tract, which everyone acknowledges abutted the\nhighway. But the parties agree that the 2002 quitclaim deed does not include a legal\ndescription of the 1970 tract in its list of land being transferred.\n\n\n       The problem with Clark's arguments, however, is more fundamental. As we have\nindicated, the district court correctly found that the Goodwills transferred the 1970 and\nthe 1972 tracts of land to the State in fee simple, reserving only the oil, gas, and mineral\n\n\n                                               8\n\frights to the Goodwills and their successors. We thus affirm the district court's ruling that\nClark does not own that property.\n\n\n       There may have been a factual question as to whether the State or the City now\nowns the 1970 tract. But if such a question existed, that dispute would have been between\nthe State and the City. We note that the State has not contested the district court's ruling\nthat the City owns that land. Clark himself, as successor to the Goodwills, may be curious\nas to who owns that property. But he has no legal, cognizable interest in that\ndetermination. Thus, he has no standing to further contest the property's ownership.\nAccord Wood v.

The\ndistrict court eventually granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that the\nCity\u2014and not Clark\u2014owned the property. Clark appeals. After carefully considering the\nparties&#x27; arguments and the record before us, we affirm the district court&#x27;s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The central question in this case is who owns two tracts of land adjacent to Dane\nAvenue, which was formerly Kansas Highway 273 (or K-273), in Williamsburg. In 1970\nand 1972, Darreld and Helen Goodwill deeded two plots of land\u2014consisting of .23 acres\nand .26 acres, respectively\u2014to the Kansas Highway Commission. Each deed, titled a\n&quot;Deed for Highway Purposes,&quot; transferred &quot;fee simple&quot; rights to the land to the\nCommission but retained interests in the oil, gas, and mineral rights.\n\n\n       In September 2002, the City of Williamsburg annexed all of K-273 in Franklin\nCounty from the State. Later that month, the Secretary of Transportation adopted a\nresolution removing K-273 from the state highway system, stating &quot;the existing road shall\nrevert to local public authority.&quot; And in November 2002, the State issued a quitclaim\ndeed to the City for various tracts of land in Franklin County. This deed explicitly\nreferenced the .26 acres of land transferred to the State in 1972 by the Goodwills but did\nnot mention the .23 acres transferred in 1970.\n\n\n       Meanwhile, the Goodwills sold their remaining property. In 2003, Clark bought\nthat remaining property from the Goodwills&#x27; successors in interest. Clark&#x27;s deed stated\nthat he was receiving the land that used to belong to the Goodwills &quot;except [for the] land\ndeeded for highway [purposes].&quot;\n\n\n       In June 2020, the City&#x27;s mayor, Stover, was mowing grass next to Dane Avenue in\nWilliamsburg on land Clark believed was his. Stover apparently damaged trees, flowers,\nand electrical supply lines. Clark asked city officials to acknowledge that he owned the\nland, and when they refused, he filed this quiet-title action to determine the land&#x27;s\nownership.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       In the lawsuit, Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the two tracts\nand that the City only held a 20-foot easement from the centerline of Dane Avenue. He\nalso sought damages for the harm Stover caused when he mowed the land. The City\nresponded that it owned the two tracts of land in fee simple. It asserted that it had\nacquired the land from the State when the State removed the K-273 from the state\nhighway system and issued the quitclaim deed to the City. The City also argued that if it\ndid indeed only hold an easement on the land, the easement ran 30 feet from the\ncenterline of Dane Avenue, not 20 feet like Clark claimed.\n\n\n       The case proceeded through discovery, and both parties eventually moved for\nsummary judgment. Clark sought a declaratory judgment that he owned the land and\ndamages for a trespass against chattels claim against Stover, and the City sought the\nopposite\u2014a declaratory judgment that it owned the land and a dismissal of all Clark&#x27;s\nother claims.\n\n\n       The district court held a hearing on the opposing motions. At the hearing, Clark\nsuggested that the district court only decide who owned the land and allow him to appeal\nthat ruling, leaving the trespass question for another day. The City did not oppose this\nprocedure.\n\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment for the City. The court found that the\nCity, and not Clark, owned the two tracts of land in fee simple, though Clark retained the\nmineral rights (a matter neither party contested). The court also found that the City had a\n30-foot right-of-way on either side of the centerline of Dane Avenue. The court reserved\nruling on Clark&#x27;s trespass claim. Clark appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n        Clark challenges both rulings by the district court. He claims the court erred when\nit found that the City, not Clark, owns the two tracts of land adjacent to Dane Avenue.\nAnd he asserts that the court erred when it found that the City had a 30-foot right-of-way,\nnot a 20-foot right-of-way, from the centerline of Dane Avenue. The City urges us to\naffirm both rulings.\n\n\n        We note that although the parties and the district court treated these questions\nindependently, they are in essence swallowed by Clark&#x27;s quiet-title claim. The two tracts\nof land\u2014which we refer to as the 1970 tract and the 1972 tract\u2014are adjacent to the road\nand thus include the contested right-of-way. The extent of the City&#x27;s right-of-way would\nonly become important if we were to conclude that Clark owned the 1970 or 1972 tract.\nBut we agree with the district court that Clark does not own that property; the Goodwills\ntransferred that property in fee simple to the State more than 50 years ago. Thus, the\nGoodwills and their successors could not have transferred that same property to Clark in\n2003. As we explain more fully below, we affirm the court&#x27;s judgment in favor of the\nCity.\n\n\n   1. This court has jurisdiction to consider Clark&#x27;s appeal.\n\n        Before considering the merits of the parties&#x27; arguments, we pause to address a\nprocedural question concerning our authority to hear this appeal. As we have indicated,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to the City on most of the claims in the case\n(those relating to the ownership of the property and the extent of the City&#x27;s right-of-way),\nbut it did not rule on Clark&#x27;s trespass claim. The court&#x27;s journal entry of judgment\ncertified the ownership and right-of-way decisions for interlocutory appeal under K.S.A.\n60-2102(c). Clark, however, did not file an application for interlocutory appeal with this\ncourt within 14 days, as that provision requires. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 60-2102(c).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fInstead, he filed a notice of appeal with the district court and docketed the appeal with the\nCourt of Appeals in the ordinary fashion a few weeks later.\n\n\n       Most cases that come before us in this manner are final judgments\u2014judgments\nthat dispose entirely of the merits of the claims in a case\u2014appealable under K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 60-2102(a)(4).

We agree with the\nparties that the district court&#x27;s decision that Clark does not own the two tracts of land in\nquestion carries the finality required to proceed on appeal. We therefore turn to the\ndistrict court&#x27;s summary-judgment ruling.\n\n\n   2. The district court correctly held that Clark does not own the land in question.\n\n       Clark challenges the district court&#x27;s ruling that he does not own the 1970 and 1972\ntracts in two main ways. He asserts that the court erred when it found that the Goodwills\ntransferred that land in fee simple; he points out that although the language of the 1970\n\n\n                                                5\n\fand 1972 deeds include phrases Kansas courts have typically found to create fee-simple\ngrants, those deeds state the transfer was &quot;for Highway Purposes.&quot; He also points out that\nthe State&#x27;s quitclaim deed in 2002 made no reference to the 1970 tract; he argues that this,\nat the very least, leaves a factual question as to who owns that property. Kansas caselaw\nundermines both assertions.\n\n\n       Clark first argues that the 1970 and 1972 deeds created a limited transfer for\nhighway purposes. In doing so, Clark acknowledges that the Goodwills transferred some\ninterest in the two tracts of land to the State in 1970 and 1972, and those deeds stated\nthey were transferring the land in fee simple. But he claims the deeds&#x27; reference to the\nland&#x27;s usage for highway purposes limited the nature of the transfer, and ownership of the\nproperty reverted to him (or to his predecessors in interest) when the State ceased using\nK-273 as a state highway in 2002.\n\n\n       The basis for this assertion requires a bit more development. As we have\nmentioned, the 1970 and 1972 deeds from the Goodwills to the State were each titled as a\n&quot;Deed for Highway Purposes.&quot; Each deed contained identical operative language, stating\nthe deed transferred the respective tract of land to the State\n\n\n       &quot;(excepting the oil and gas minerals under or in said lands) . . . together with all and\n       singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtances thereto belonging or in any wise\n       appertaining, forever. It is understood and agreed that [the State] is acquiring said real\n       estate for state highway purposes.\n               &quot;And [the Goodwills] do hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with [the\n       State] that at delivery of these presents they are lawfully seized of an estate in fee simple\n       in all and singular the above granted and described premises with the appurtenances\n       thereto, except for the right of way of any existing public highway thereon; that the same\n       are free and clear of and from all and every incumbrance whatsoever, . . . and that they\n       will forever warrant and defend the same unto [the State] or its assigns forever, against all\n       and any lawful claim of all and any persons whomsoever.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n\f       Clark correctly points out that the plain language of these deeds indicated that they\nwere transferring the land for highway purposes. He thus argues that the deeds created a\nlimited transfer\u2014a fee simple determinable interest in the land\u2014that would\nautomatically revert to the grantor when a specific condition ceases to occur. So, Clark\ncontends, these tracts automatically reverted to the previous owner of his property in\n2002 when Dane Avenue was no longer used for highway purposes as K-273.\n\n\n       We disagree. Kansas courts have consistently interpreted similar language in\ndeeds as transferring land in fee simple without any reversion. More than 40 years ago,\nthe Kansas Supreme Court observed that it is &quot;well settled that the mere expression that\nproperty is to be used for a particular purpose will not in and of itself suffice to turn a fee\nsimple into a determinable fee.&quot; Roberts v. Rhodes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">231 Kan. 74</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">643 P.2d 116</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1982).\n\n\n       The court&#x27;s decision in Roberts illustrates this principle. There, previous property\nowners had transferred land to a school district in 1902 and 1908. Both deeds essentially\nstated that the property was being transferred &quot;&#x27;only for school or cemetery purposes.&#x27;&quot;\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">231 Kan. at 75</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The land was then used for school purposes for more than 60 years, until\nthe school district sold the land in 1971. The successor to the original property owners,\nRoberts, challenged the person who had received title from the school district, Rhodes,\nclaiming the land should revert to Roberts when it ceased being used for school purposes.\n\n\n       On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged the difficulty of interpreting\nthese deeds when the parties did not &quot;provide for what should happen to the land after it\nhas been used for school purposes for sixty years and then is no longer needed for such\npurpose.&quot; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">231 Kan. at 76</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But our Supreme Court found that despite the language in the\n1902 and 1908 deeds regarding the intended use of the property, &quot;neither deed made\nprovision for the estate to revert or terminate&quot; if the land ceased being used for that\npurpose. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">231 Kan. at 76</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Without any explicit language indicating a reversion, the court\n\n\n                                               7\n\fheld that the 1902 and 1908 deeds had transferred title in fee simple, not fee simple\ndeterminable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439759/roberts-v-rhodes/\">231 Kan. at 80</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n       As this discussion highlights, it has long been the law in this state that a deed must\nclearly and explicitly reserve a reversionary interest in the grantor to create a fee simple\ndeterminable interest. Kinney v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1207120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1207120/kinney-v-kansas-fish-game-commn/\">238 Kan. 375</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1207120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1207120/kinney-v-kansas-fish-game-commn/\">710 P.2d 1290</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). The\n1970 and 1972 deeds at issue in this case did not do that. Instead, they transferred the\nland to the State in fee simple without restriction, reserving for the Goodwills only the\noil, gas, and mineral interests. Thus, the district court correctly found that, despite the\nlanguage signifying the Goodwills&#x27; present intent, the 1970 and 1972 deeds transferred\nunlimited, fee simple ownership of the two tracts of land to the State.\n\n\n       Clark next asserts that, even if the Goodwills&#x27; transfer to the State was not limited\nto using the land as a state highway, the district court erred when it found at summary\njudgment that the City now owns that property. Clark argues that there is a factual\nquestion as to whether the City ever received title to the 1970 tract, as it was not\nexplicitly described in the quitclaim deed the State provided to the City when it\ntransferred the property in 2002.\n\n\n       Quitclaim deeds often are less than precise, and the 2002 quitclaim deed from the\nState to the City here is no different. The 2002 quitclaim deed does indicate that the State\nis transferring all property previously surrounding K-273 in Franklin County to the City.\nThis would appear to include the 1970 tract, which everyone acknowledges abutted the\nhighway. But the parties agree that the 2002 quitclaim deed does not include a legal\ndescription of the 1970 tract in its list of land being transferred.\n\n\n       The problem with Clark&#x27;s arguments, however, is more fundamental. As we have\nindicated, the district court correctly found that the Goodwills transferred the 1970 and\nthe 1972 tracts of land to the State in fee simple, reserving only the oil, gas, and mineral\n\n\n                                               8\n\frights to the Goodwills and their successors. We thus affirm the district court&#x27;s ruling that\nClark does not own that property.\n\n\n       There may have been a factual question as to whether the State or the City now\nowns the 1970 tract. But if such a question existed, that dispute would have been between\nthe State and the City. We note that the State has not contested the district court&#x27;s ruling\nthat the City owns that land. Clark himself, as successor to the Goodwills, may be curious\nas to who owns that property. But he has no legal, cognizable interest in that\ndetermination. Thus, he has no standing to further contest the property&#x27;s ownership.\nAccord Wood v.

Schaffer and Shannon Smith, of Schaffer & Associates, Chartered, of Overland Park, for\nappellee.\n\n\nBefore HILL, P.J., MALONE and ISHERWOOD, JJ.\n\n\n        PER CURIAM: Clara Fuller filed a complaint with the Kansas Insurance\nDepartment alleging that Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (Liberty Mutual) failed to refund\nher the full amount of insurance premiums she was entitled to after her property was\nforeclosed upon. The Department declined to find any fault in Liberty Mutual's actions so\nFuller sought relief in the district court through a civil suit. The district court ultimately\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual. On appeal, Fuller argues the\ndistrict court erred because the burden to cancel the policy was not hers to bear. She also\ncontends the district court arrived at its conclusion by engaging in an ex parte\n\n                                                  1\n\fcommunication which violated her right to due process. We have thoroughly analyzed the\nrecord and failed to find any error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order\ngranting Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Claudine Fuller owned a home in Wyandotte County, Kansas, that was insured\nunder a policy through Liberty Mutual. Claudine died in July 2016, and the home passed\nto her sister, Clara (Fuller). The 12-month homeowner's policy was automatically\nrenewed in November of that year, and, under its terms, Fuller became the insured party.\nThe language of the policy contemplated that should Fuller ever desire to cancel it, she\nwas required to provide written notice of her intent, accompanied by a specific\ncancellation date, to Liberty Mutual. Fuller claimed to have no knowledge of the policy,\nso written notice was never issued to Liberty Mutual. As a result, Liberty Mutual\ncontinued to receive payments through an escrow account with Claudine's mortgage\nprovider, Selene Finance.\n\n\n       In May 2017, Selene Finance notified Liberty Mutual that the property was\npotentially vacant. Several months later, Liberty Mutual verified the vacancy and\ncancelled the policy. Upon receiving notice of the cancellation, Selene Finance informed\nLiberty Mutual that the property was subject to foreclosure four months earlier. Liberty\nMutual then backdated the cancellation date to reflect the foreclosure date and issued a\nprorated premium refund check to Fuller for $556.\n\n\n       Fuller believed she was entitled to a refund encompassing the total amount of\npremiums paid to Liberty Mutual from the time of Claudine's death in July 2016 through\nthe policy's cancellation in September 2017, and filed a complaint with the Kansas\nInsurance Department (the Department) seeking to recover those additional funds. The\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fDepartment investigated the matter and concluded that the amount Fuller received from\nLiberty Mutual was appropriate.\n\n\n       Unsatisfied, Fuller filed a civil suit in the district court and claimed she was\nentitled to a refund totaling $3,354. Liberty Mutual moved for summary judgment and\nasserted that Fuller failed to submit a written cancellation as required by the policy,\ntherefore, she was not entitled to any additional funds. The district court held a hearing\non the motion, after which it granted Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n\n       Fuller now brings the matter to us for a determination of whether the district\ncourt's ruling and the manner it was arrived at were erroneous.\n\n\n                                      LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe district court properly granted Liberty Mutual's request for summary judgment.\n\n       In her first claim of error, Fuller reiterates her contention that she is entitled to a\nrefund for the full amount she requested because it was not her responsibility to ensure\nthe policy got cancelled. Liberty Mutual counters that the plain terms of the policy placed\nthe obligation at Fuller's feet to provide written notice of her intent to cancel the policy\nand she neglected to do so.\n\n\n       We can extrapolate from a broad reading of Fuller's notice of appeal that she seeks\nto appeal the district court's order which granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty\nMutual. But her brief fails to clarify those intentions and the absence of the standard of\nreview used to analyze appeals from an order granting summary judgment further\ncomplicates the matter. We acknowledge that pro se filings are to be liberally construed\nbut, equally true, is the fact that such litigants are not entitled to special treatment when\nthey fail to follow procedural rules. See State v. Redding, 310 Kan. 15, Syl. \u00b6 1, 444 P.3d\n\n\n                                               3\n\f989 (2019). We cannot address arguments not properly before us, nor can we supplement\narguments that are inadequately briefed to bring them up to par. Joritz v. University of\nKansas, 61 Kan. App. 2d 482, 498-99, 505 P.3d 775, rev. denied 315 Kan. 968 (2022).\nWe find that through the exercise of an appropriate degree of liberal construction, the\ncontents of Fuller's brief are adequate to enable us to review her claim.\n\n\n       Appellate courts review the district court's denial of a motion for summary\njudgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\nmotion. If reasonable minds could differ about the conclusions drawn from the\nevidence\u2014meaning, there is a genuine issue about a material fact\u2014then summary\njudgment should be denied. John Doe v. M.J., 315 Kan. 310, 313, 508 P.3d 368 (2022).\nAn issue of fact is not considered genuine unless it has legal force as to the controlling\nissue. In other words, if the disputed fact, however resolved, could not affect the\njudgment, it does not present a \"genuine issue\" for purposes of summary judgment.\nNorthern Natural Gas Co. v. ONEOK Field Services Co., 296 Kan. 906, 934, 296 P.3d\n1106, cert. denied 571 U.S. 826 (2013).\n\n\n       Additionally, the interpretation and legal effect of written instruments are matters\nof law, and we exercise unlimited review when that analysis is required. First Security\nBank v. Buehne, 314 Kan. 507, 510, 501 P.3d 362 (2021). \"'The primary rule for\ninterpreting written contracts is to ascertain the parties' intent. If the terms of the contract\nare clear, the intent of the parties is to be determined from the language of the contract\nwithout applying rules of construction.'\" Russell v. Treanor Investments, 311 Kan. 675,\n680, 466 P.3d 481 (2020).\n\n\n       With those principles as a backdrop, we turn to subsection (5)(a) of the Conditions\nfor Sections I and II of the insurance policy. That provision specifically states: \"[The\ninsured] may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to [Liberty Mutual] or by\nletting [Liberty Mutual] know in writing of the date cancellation is to take effect.\"\n\n                                               4\n\fProbing further into the policy, the language of subsection (5)(b)(3)(b) reflects that\n\"[w]hen this policy has been in effect for 60 days or more, or at any time if it is a renewal\nwith [Liberty Mutual], [Liberty Mutual] may cancel: [i]f the risk has changed\nsubstantially since the policy was issued.\" Finally, subsection (9)(a) provides: \"If any\nperson named in the Declarations or the spouse, if a resident of the same household, dies:\n[Liberty Mutual] insure[s] the legal representative of the deceased but only with respect\nto the premises and property of the deceased covered under the policy at the time of\ndeath.\"\n\n\n       Fuller has failed to satisfy her burden to show that a disputed material fact exists\nwith respect to whether she provided written notice to Liberty Mutual of her intent to\ncancel the policy. Rather, Fuller takes the position that the onus was on Liberty Mutual to\nobtain notice of Claudine's passing through Selene Finance and, upon doing so, to then\ncancel the policy on its own accord. This argument directly contravenes the plain\nlanguage of the policy which clearly states that once Claudine passed away, Fuller\nbecame the insured party by virtue of her status as the executrix of Claudine's estate. In\nother words, her legal representative. As the insured, it was Fuller's responsibility to\nnotify Liberty Mutual that she no longer wished to continue the policy. Fuller's claim that\nshe was unaware of the policy's existence and, correspondingly, her obligation to provide\nnotice of cancellation, does not relieve her of that obligation. Further, Fuller fails to direct\nus to any provision within the policy that automatically makes Liberty Mutual the party\nresponsible for ensuring cancellation occurs upon the death of an insured. Without notice\nof an intent to cancel from Fuller, Liberty Mutual operated in conformity with the\nagreement when it continued to offer coverage and collect premiums until it canceled the\npolicy following foreclosure of the property.\n\n\n       Because the record shows that no genuine issue exists as to whether Fuller failed\nto fulfill her obligation to cancel the policy, as contemplated by its terms and, therefore,\nwas not eligible to receive the refund requested, Liberty Mutual was entitled to judgment\n\n                                               5\n\fas a matter of law. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of\nLiberty Mutual.\n\n\nThe district court did not violate the right to procedural due process that Fuller is\nentitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n       For the first time on appeal, Fuller argues that her due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated because the\ndistrict court held an ex parte hearing. Liberty Mutual responds that no such hearing\noccurred.\n\n\n       Appellate review of an alleged due process violation is a question of law over\nwhich the appellate court has unlimited review. Hemphill v. Kansas Dept. of Revenue,\n270 Kan. 83, 89, 11 P.3d 1165 (2000). \"In reviewing a procedural due process claim, the\ncourt first must determine whether a protected liberty or property interest is involved. If\nso, the court then must determine the nature and extent of the process which is due.\" State\nv. N.R., 314 Kan. 98, 113, 495 P.3d 16 (2021), cert. denied 142 S. Ct. 1678 (2022). A due\nprocess violation exists only if the complaining party shows that he or she was denied a\nspecific procedural protection to which he or she is entitled. In re K.E., 294 Kan. 17, 22,\n272 P.3d 28 (2012). The basic elements of procedural due process are notice and \"the\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\" In re Care &\nTreatment of Ellison, 305 Kan. 519, 526, 385 P.3d 15 (2016).\n\n\n       Fuller has failed to advance a compelling argument which undeniably\ndemonstrates that her claim to recover the insurance premiums involves a protected\nproperty interest as envisioned by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Even if we assume her assertion in this regard is an accurate one, she has\nalso failed to establish how she was denied a specific procedural protection. Ex parte\nhearings are those \"proceedings had at the instance or for the benefit of one side, or of\n\n\n                                              6\n\fone party, only, without notice to or contest by any person adversely affected, or in the\nabsence of opposing parties.\" In re Bowlus' Will, 197 Kan. 351, 357, 416 P.2d 711\n(1966). To show that an ex parte hearing occurred, Fuller directs our attention to the\ndistrict court judge's statements at the hearing that he reviewed the case, but later said\nthat Fuller failed to respond to Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment when\nFuller had, in fact, filed a response. This allegation is insufficient to establish that the\ndistrict court communicated with Liberty Mutual about the case outside the presence of\nFuller, and our review of the record fails to yield any indication that such an exchange or\nhearing occurred. To the contrary, the district court held a hearing on the motion for\nsummary judgment and Fuller was afforded a fair opportunity to argue her position\nbefore the district court.\n\n\n       Because there is no evidence that an ex parte hearing occurred and Fuller received\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the motion for summary judgment,\nher claim that the district court violated her right to procedural due process fails.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 126,073\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                            CLARA FULLER,\n                                              Appellant,\n\n                                                  v.\n\n                            LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n                                        Appellee.\n\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Wyandotte District Court; BILL KLAPPER, judge.

That provision specifically states: &quot;[The\ninsured] may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to [Liberty Mutual] or by\nletting [Liberty Mutual] know in writing of the date cancellation is to take effect.&quot;\n\n                                               4\n\fProbing further into the policy, the language of subsection (5)(b)(3)(b) reflects that\n&quot;[w]hen this policy has been in effect for 60 days or more, or at any time if it is a renewal\nwith [Liberty Mutual], [Liberty Mutual] may cancel: [i]f the risk has changed\nsubstantially since the policy was issued.&quot; Finally, subsection (9)(a) provides: &quot;If any\nperson named in the Declarations or the spouse, if a resident of the same household, dies:\n[Liberty Mutual] insure[s] the legal representative of the deceased but only with respect\nto the premises and property of the deceased covered under the policy at the time of\ndeath.&quot;\n\n\n       Fuller has failed to satisfy her burden to show that a disputed material fact exists\nwith respect to whether she provided written notice to Liberty Mutual of her intent to\ncancel the policy. Rather, Fuller takes the position that the onus was on Liberty Mutual to\nobtain notice of Claudine&#x27;s passing through Selene Finance and, upon doing so, to then\ncancel the policy on its own accord. This argument directly contravenes the plain\nlanguage of the policy which clearly states that once Claudine passed away, Fuller\nbecame the insured party by virtue of her status as the executrix of Claudine&#x27;s estate. In\nother words, her legal representative. As the insured, it was Fuller&#x27;s responsibility to\nnotify Liberty Mutual that she no longer wished to continue the policy. Fuller&#x27;s claim that\nshe was unaware of the policy&#x27;s existence and, correspondingly, her obligation to provide\nnotice of cancellation, does not relieve her of that obligation. Further, Fuller fails to direct\nus to any provision within the policy that automatically makes Liberty Mutual the party\nresponsible for ensuring cancellation occurs upon the death of an insured. Without notice\nof an intent to cancel from Fuller, Liberty Mutual operated in conformity with the\nagreement when it continued to offer coverage and collect premiums until it canceled the\npolicy following foreclosure of the property.\n\n\n       Because the record shows that no genuine issue exists as to whether Fuller failed\nto fulfill her obligation to cancel the policy, as contemplated by its terms and, therefore,\nwas not eligible to receive the refund requested, Liberty Mutual was entitled to judgment\n\n                                               5\n\fas a matter of law. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of\nLiberty Mutual.\n\n\nThe district court did not violate the right to procedural due process that Fuller is\nentitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n       For the first time on appeal, Fuller argues that her due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated because the\ndistrict court held an ex parte hearing. Liberty Mutual responds that no such hearing\noccurred.\n\n\n       Appellate review of an alleged due process violation is a question of law over\nwhich the appellate court has unlimited review.

To show that an ex parte hearing occurred, Fuller directs our attention to the\ndistrict court judge&#x27;s statements at the hearing that he reviewed the case, but later said\nthat Fuller failed to respond to Liberty Mutual&#x27;s motion for summary judgment when\nFuller had, in fact, filed a response. This allegation is insufficient to establish that the\ndistrict court communicated with Liberty Mutual about the case outside the presence of\nFuller, and our review of the record fails to yield any indication that such an exchange or\nhearing occurred. To the contrary, the district court held a hearing on the motion for\nsummary judgment and Fuller was afforded a fair opportunity to argue her position\nbefore the district court.\n\n\n       Because there is no evidence that an ex parte hearing occurred and Fuller received\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the motion for summary judgment,\nher claim that the district court violated her right to procedural due process fails.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1232581/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2581806/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/5138927/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923255/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923445/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925375/", "id": 9925375, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467537/in-re-care-and-treatment-of-davis/", "cluster_id": 9467537, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467537/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:05:13.270556-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:23:25.926300-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "09ef33772f5be241bea29938f7575038f1ad3d82", "page_count": 5, "download_url": "https://www.kscourts.org/KSCourts/media/KsCourts/Opinions/126085.pdf?ext=.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/in_re_care_and_treatment_of_davis.pdf", "plain_text": "                         NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 126,085\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                           In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of\n                                       ROBERT DAVIS JR.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n       Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; ROBB W.

Kobach, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\n\nBefore WARNER, P.J., ATCHESON, J., and MARY E. CHRISTOPHER, S.J.\n\n       PER CURIAM: Since being confined for treatment as a sexually violent predator in\nDecember 2018, Robert Davis Jr. has annually requested that the Sedgwick County\nDistrict Court order his placement in a transitional living program\u2014the final preparatory\nstep to being conditionally released. He has been denied each time. In this appeal, Davis\nchallenges the district court's denial based on the 2022 report and supplement prepared by\nmembers of the treatment program's clinical staff recommending no change in his\nplacement. We find no error in the district court's ruling and affirm.\n\n\n       By statute, persons held for treatment under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator\nAct, K.S.A. 59-29a01 et seq., are to be clinically evaluated each year and a report of their\nstatus is to be forwarded to the district court that ordered their commitment. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 59-29a08(a). The inmates may petition the appropriate district court for review\n\n                                                        1\n\fhearings to consider whether they should be placed in the transitional release phase of the\ntreatment program. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-29a08(b). The hearing process unfolds in two\nsequential steps. The district court initially determines if the petitioner, here Davis, has\nshown probable cause to believe the mental abnormality triggering his confinement has\nsufficiently changed to warrant placement in transitional release. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-\n29a08(d). If the petitioner makes that showing, the district court must hold a full\nevidentiary hearing at which the State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the petitioner is unfit for transitional release. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 59-29a08(g).\n\n\n       Here, Davis sought a review hearing for consideration of the 2022 report on his\nstatus, along with a supplemental report. The district court appointed a lawyer to\nrepresent Davis at the probable cause hearing but declined to authorize an independent\nclinical evaluation of Davis. And Davis was not present for the hearing. See K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 59-29a08(c) (The district court may, in its discretion, order an independent clinical\nexamination of an indigent petitioner in advance of the probable cause hearing.); K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 59-29a08(e) (petitioner entitled to legal representation at probable cause\nhearing; but petitioner need not be present).\n\n\n       After reviewing the annual report and related materials and hearing argument from\nthe lawyers for Davis and the State, the district court concluded Davis failed to\ndemonstrate probable cause that his deleterious mental condition had substantially\nimproved. The hearing record established that Davis remained in the first phase of the\nthree-phase treatment protocol for placement in transitional release\u2014the step\nimmediately preceding conditional release and then, ultimately, full release from the\ntreatment program.\n\n\n       The report and supplement showed Davis generally complied with many of the\nprogram requirements and objectives. But the picture was not categorically positive.\nDavis didn't consistently maintain his medication regimen and displayed negative\n\n                                                  2\n\fbehavioral traits as a result. Davis directed angry outbursts at staff and other program\nparticipants. And Davis\u2014in the view of the clinicians preparing the reports\u2014did not deal\nappropriately with a sexual attraction he developed for one of his therapists. The report\nnoted that several actuarial instruments designed to predict the likelihood of recidivism\namong sex offenders placed Davis in what would be considered at least a moderate range\nfor reoffending. The clinicians concluded Davis was appropriately placed in the first\nstage of the treatment program.\n\n\n       In the district court, Davis' lawyer assailed the original commitment proceeding as\nunfair and disputed the effectiveness of the treatment program generally as a genuinely\nrehabilitative process for sex offenders rather than as tool to continue their confinement\nbeyond the prison terms they had already served. Those rhetorical thunderclaps produced\nno legal lightning. They are not germane to the narrow issue relevant in an annual review\nhearing.\n\n\n       The district court declined to order a full evidentiary hearing, effectively denying\nDavis relief. Davis has appealed that ruling.\n\n\n       On appeal, Davis basically argues he satisfied his burden of demonstrating\nprobable cause to believe his mental condition had substantially improved, thereby\nwarranting an evidentiary hearing on his request to be placed in transitional release. We\nowe no particular deference to the district court's conclusion because it rests on\nessentially undisputed evidence and involved no credibility determinations. In re Estate\nof Oroke, 310 Kan. 305, 310, 445 P.3d 742 (2019) (\"Application of legal principles to\nundisputed facts involves questions of law subject to de novo review.\"); In re Care &\nTreatment of Burch, 296 Kan. 215, 223, 291 P.3d 78 (2012) (unlimited appellate review\nof district court's probable cause determination in annual review hearing based on clinical\nreports and lawyers' arguments). We, like the district court, must view the hearing record\nin a light favoring Davis and in support of a probable cause finding. 296 Kan. at 224.\n\n                                                 3\n\f       In this context, \"probable cause\" mirrors the customary definition given the phrase\nin the criminal law: \"[W]hether there is sufficient evidence to cause a person of ordinary\nprudence and action to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief that the committed\nperson's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe\nto be placed in transitional release.\" In re Care & Treatment of Sipe, 44 Kan. App. 2d\n584, 593, 239 P.3d 871 (2010); see In re Care & Treatment of Miles, 47 Kan. App. 2d\n429, 434-35, 276 P.3d 232 (2012) (adopting standard set out in Sipe and noting match\nwith criminal law test for probable cause). Although probable cause is a comparatively\nrelaxed standard, falling well below a preponderance of the evidence, it still requires\nevidence of some substance in support of the proposition to be proved. See State v.\nWalker, 283 Kan. 587, 595, 153 P.3d 1257 (2007) (Substantial evidence is that which\nmight cause a reasonable person to accept a given factual conclusion.).\n\n\n       Having reviewed the hearing record and considering the limited issue before us,\nwe find the district court correctly concluded Davis failed to establish probable cause that\nhe should be placed in the transitional phase of the treatment program. The annual report\nand supplement conclude Davis remains properly placed in the initial treatment phase and\ncite substantial factual bases for the conclusion. Davis failed to adhere to his medication\nregimen, leading to problematic behavior. He apparently failed to deal appropriately with\ncertain sexual urges he felt toward a therapist. And actuarial testing suggested he\nremained at a demonstrable risk for reoffending. See In re Care & Treatment of Cone,\n309 Kan. 321, 332, 435 P.3d 45 (2019) (finding scientific foundation for actuarial test\ndesigned to measure potential recidivism of sex offenders sufficiently reliable, so test\nresults admissible in commitment proceeding). Davis neither undermined the factual\nrepresentations in the report and supplement nor called into question the credibility of the\nclinicians preparing those materials.\n\n\n       In short, the record fails to show marked positive changes in Davis' mental\ncondition that would foster a reasonable belief he is an appropriate candidate for\n\n                                                 4\n\ftransitional placement, in effect skipping two levels of progressive treatment conducted\nwithin the facility.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                         NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 126,085\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                           In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of\n                                       ROBERT DAVIS JR.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n       Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; ROBB W.

Kobach, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., ATCHESON, J., and TIMOTHY G. LAHEY, S.J.\n\n\n       ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J.: Once a district court pronounces a legal sentence, it\ngenerally loses jurisdiction to modify that sentence except to correct mathematical or\nclerical errors. State v. Johnson, 309 Kan. 992, 996, 441 P.3d 1036 (2019). Costs are not\nconsidered to be part of a defendant's sentence. State v. Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, 34-35, 210\nP.3d 93 (2009). Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) fees are court costs under K.S.A.\n28-176(a)(1). Because KBI fees are not part of the sentence, we find the district court did\nnot lack jurisdiction when it imposed a KBI fee at Joseph Randall Garrison's\nresentencing that it had rejected at his original sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Garrison pleaded guilty to attempted possession of methamphetamine as part of a\nplea agreement. The district court accepted Garrison's plea and eventually sentenced him\nto 34 months in prison.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the district court initially ordered Garrison to pay a $400 KBI lab\nfee. Defense counsel said he did not believe there was a lab fee. The district court\nbelieved the PSI report showed a lab fee but said if there was not a lab fee then it should\nnot be assessed. The prosecutor informed the district court that it did not look like they\n\"ha[d] a lab result back on this one.\" Based on this statement, the district court concluded\nthat the KBI lab fee would not be imposed.\n\n\n       Less than a month after sentencing, and before any journal entry or notice of\nappeal was filed, Garrison moved to correct an illegal sentence. He noted that he was\nsentenced for possession of methamphetamine when his crime of conviction was\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. Under K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1),\n\"[a]n attempt to commit a felony which prescribes a sentence on the drug grid shall\nreduce the prison term prescribed in the drug grid block for an underlying or completed\ncrime by six months.\" Accordingly, he argued, his sentence should have been reduced by\nsix months. The State agreed that Garrison's sentence should be reduced.\n\n\n       The district court granted Garrison's motion and the case proceeded to\nresentencing. The district court reduced Garrison's sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 2021\nSupp. 21-5301(d)(1), resulting in a 28-month prison sentence.\n\n\n       Relevant to this appeal, the $400 KBI lab fee was also discussed. Defense counsel\nstated that he did not believe there was a KBI fee in the case and that it should not be\nimposed. The prosecutor disagreed that there was no KBI fee and stated that she had the\n\n                                              2\n\fKBI lab reports. The prosecutor indicated that she had showed the report to defense\ncounsel, and she believed he agreed regarding the fee. Defense counsel stated his\nagreement by responding, \"Yeah.\" Defense counsel then stated that he did not receive the\nlab report before the original sentencing, so he thought there was not one. The district\ncourt assessed the $400 KBI lab fee and filed a journal entry reflecting the same. See\nK.S.A. 28-176(a).\n\n\n       Garrison appealed.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction to impose the\nKBI lab fee after it had elected not to do so at the initial sentencing.\n\n\n       Whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law, subject to unlimited appellate\nreview. State v. Hillard, 315 Kan. 732, 775, 511 P.3d 883 (2022). Subject matter\njurisdiction may be raised at any time, whether for the first time on appeal or even on the\nappellate court's own motion. State v. Clark, 313 Kan. 556, 560, 486 P.3d 591 (2021).\n\n\n       Generally, the district court retains jurisdiction over a case until an appeal is\ndocketed with the appellate court. State v. Thurber, 313 Kan. 1002, 1006, 492 P.3d 1185\n(2021). The district court's jurisdiction is limited after sentencing, because once the\ndistrict court pronounced a legal sentence, it generally loses jurisdiction to modify that\nsentence except to correct mathematical or clerical errors. State v. Johnson, 309 Kan.\n992, 996, 441 P.3d 1036 (2019).\n\n\n       Although a person's legal sentence cannot be modified after sentencing, costs are\nnot considered to be part of a defendant's sentence. Phillips, 289 Kan. at 34-35\n(explaining that costs are not punitive and therefore are not a part of the sentence\n\n                                               3\n\fimposed in a criminal case). KBI fees are one of the court costs that can be imposed on a\ndefendant under K.S.A. 28-176(a). In fact, K.S.A. 28-176(a) requires a fee be assessed by\nthe court anytime laboratory services are provided as part of the investigation in the case.\nThe court can only lessen or waive such fees if the defendant is indigent, and the court\nmakes such a finding on the record. K.S.A. 28-176(c). So to the extent laboratory\nservices were provided by the KBI, it would have been error for the district court not to\naccess the related fees.\n\n\n       Moreover, Kansas appellate courts have previously held that costs can be assessed\nafter sentencing. For example, in Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, the district court ordered the\ndefendant to pay a docket fee, booking fee, and a Board of Indigents' Defense Services\n(BIDS) application fee. The district court did not announce the imposition of these costs\nat sentencing. Rather, the district court merely included them in the journal entry of\njudgment. The Kansas Supreme Court found that this practice did not violate the rules\nrequiring a district court to announce a defendant's sentence in open court. 289 Kan. at\n40. While the court said that while \"announc[ing]the imposition of costs at the sentencing\nhearing . . . is a preferred practice . . . the failure to do so will not void an order to pay\ncosts.\" 289 Kan. at 45. The court also found that this practice did not violate K.S.A. 22-\n3803\u2014the statute governing taxation of costs in a criminal case. That statute provides\nthat costs \"'shall'\" be taxed \"'[a]t the conclusion of each criminal case.'\" 289 Kan. at 40\n(quoting K.S.A. 22-3803); see also State v. Dean, 12 Kan. App. 2d 321, 325, 743 P.2d 98\n(1987) (approving extradition costs imposed four months after sentencing). We have no\ntrouble finding that the district court had jurisdiction to impose lab fees at the second\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n       Garrison's brief also includes a single sentence in which he asserts that the district\ncourt erred in imposing the lab fee \"because there was no evidence of 'laboratory services'\nhaving been provided by the KBI. See K.S.A. 28-176(a).\" To the extent Garrison is\nchallenging the factual basis supporting the fee or the existence of a lab report, he did not\n\n                                                4\n\fpreserve this issue. Garrison did not object to the KBI lab fee on these grounds at his\nresentencing hearing. In fact, the brief exchange suggests that defense counsel agreed that\nthe fee should be imposed. So Garrison is raising this issue for the first time on appeal.\nGenerally, issues not raised before the district court cannot be raised on appeal. There are\nseveral exceptions to this rule, but Supreme Court Rule 6.02(a)(5) (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at\n36) requires an appellant to explain why this court should consider an issue for the first\ntime on appeal. State v. Williams, 298 Kan. 1075, 1085, 319 P.3d 528 (2014). Garrison\nmakes no such argument here.\n\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm the district court's order assessing $400 in KBI lab\nfees in this case.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n                                            ***\n\n\n       ATCHESON, J., concurring: For his only issue on appeal, Defendant Joseph\nGarrison submits the Leavenworth County District Court improperly ordered him to pay\na statutorily mandated laboratory fee when the district court declined to impose the fee\nduring his sentencing hearing but included it in the journal entry of judgment after\ndiscussing the matter with the prosecutor and his lawyer during a later proceeding. This\ncourt has held the laboratory fee\u2014to be assessed against defendants convicted of\nspecified crimes under K.S.A. 28-176 when the State's investigation requires laboratory\nor forensic services\u2014is an administrative court cost rather than a punitive sanction. State\nv. Likins, 21 Kan. App. 2d 420, 434, 903 P.2d 764 (1995); State v. Robinson, No. 122,251,\n2022 WL 17172086, at *3 (Kan. App. 2022) (unpublished opinion). The Kansas Supreme\nCourt, in turn, has held that a district court need not address, let alone order, the payment\nof statutory costs during a sentencing hearing and may simply include them in the journal\nentry of judgment. State v. Phillips, 289 Kan. 28, 34-35, 40, 210 P.3d 93 (2009)\n\n                                              5\n\f(explaining that costs are not punitive and, therefore, are not part of sentence imposed in\ncriminal case).\n\n\n       Accordingly, a district court has no obligation to \"pronounce\" payment of the\nstandard statutory laboratory fee of $400 during a sentencing hearing and may simply list\nthe fee, among other mandated costs, in the journal entry. See Phillips, 289 Kan. at 40;\nRobinson, 2022 WL 17172086, at *3 (affirming imposition of $400 laboratory fee,\namong other costs, included in journal entry of judgment even though district court did\nnot mention fee at sentencing). That's what effectively happened here. So Garrison's point\nis without merit, and the district court's order should be affirmed on that basis. I,\ntherefore, concur in the result the majority reaches, but I find its path to that conclusion\nunnecessarily rocky.\n\n\n       As part of an agreement with the State, Garrison pleaded guilty to one count of\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. The State dismissed several other charges. At\nthe sentencing hearing in mid-August 2021, the district court ordered Garrison to serve\n34 months in prison on the mistaken assumption that was the presumptive mid-level\nsentence under the guidelines. The district court denied Garrison's request for a\ndispositional departure to probation. During the hearing, the district court asked the\nprosecutor and Garrison's lawyer about the statutory laboratory fee. The lawyers told the\ndistrict court they had not seen a lab report and inferred no testing had been done, so no\nfee should be imposed. The district court, therefore, did not orally order Garrison to pay\nthe $400 fee.\n\n\n       On September 7, 2021, Garrison filed a motion to correct the sentence as illegally\nimposed because convictions for attempted drug felonies carry presumptive sentences six\nmonths shorter than for the completed crimes. See K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1). The\nrecord reflects that a journal entry of judgment had not yet been entered. At a hearing on\nthe motion about a week later, the State agreed that the 34-month sentence was illegal.\n\n                                               6\n\fThe district court granted Garrison's motion, ordered that a corrected presentence\ninvestigation report be prepared, and continued the matter for what it termed\nresentencing.\n\n\n       At the \"resentencing\" hearing on September 15, 2021, the district court again\nconsidered and rejected Garrison's motion for a dispositional departure and then imposed\na lawful guidelines sentence of 28 months in prison. The district court also raised the\nissue of the statutory laboratory fee. The prosecutor informed the district court a lab\nreport had been received, so Garrison should be ordered to pay the fee. After conferring\nwith the prosecutor, Garrison's lawyer agreed there was a lab report and did not object to\nthe fee being assessed. The district court ordered Garrison to pay that fee and other court\ncosts and waived reimbursement of the attorney fees for his appointed lawyer.\n\n\n       A journal entry of judgment that included the $400 laboratory fee was filed on\nSeptember 27, 2021. For some reason, a second journal entry of judgment, also including\nthe $400 laboratory fee and captioned as a journal entry nunc pro tunc, was filed on\nSeptember 23, 2022. Just why the second journal entry was prepared and filed has no\nbearing on this appeal.\n\n\n       Garrison offers a two-fold pitch as to why the district court erred in ordering him\nto pay the $400 laboratory fee. First, Garrison identifies the well-settled rule that when\nthe district court pronounces a lawful sentence from the bench, that sentence cannot later\nbe changed. State v. Hall, 298 Kan. 978, 983, 319 P.3d 506 (2014); State v. Deck, No.\n123,807, 2022 WL 983628, at *6 (Kan. App. 2022) (unpublished opinion), aff'd on other\ngrounds 317 Kan. 101, 525 P.3d 329 (2023). As I have indicated, Garrison would then\nhave us apply the rule to the imposition of the laboratory fee. But that aspect of\nGarrison's argument is plainly foreclosed by Phillips and Likins.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       For his second line of attack, Garrison says the district court should not have\norally ordered the laboratory fee in handling his motion to correct the illegal sentence\noriginally imposed on him for attempted possession of methamphetamine. In this respect,\nGarrison has a point. But it ultimately doesn't get him very far. If a district court grants a\nmotion to correct an illegal sentence, it then has the authority (and, indeed, the duty) to\nimpose a proper sentence. But that is the extent of its authority. See State v. Guder, 293\nKan. 763, 767, 267 P.3d 751 (2012) (when sentence on one conviction is vacated as\nillegal, district court on remand has no authority to modify lawful sentences already\nimposed on other convictions). So granting Garrison's motion did not occasion a new\nsentencing hearing to reconsider and again rule on anything and everything that typically\nwould be disposed of during such a hearing. (The term \"sentencing hearing\" is shorthand\nfor the proceeding following conviction in which the district court imposes punishment\non a defendant. But the district court typically also addresses and resolves various\nnonpunitive matters, including the imposition of court costs, such as the laboratory fee,\nand reimbursement of attorney fees for appointed counsel.)\n\n\n       The district court, therefore, likely erred in orally ordering Garrison to pay the\nlaboratory fee in conjunction with correcting his sentence. And the majority has likely\nstrayed in endorsing the notion that a full \"resentencing\" necessarily follows when the\ndistrict court grants a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The remedy presumably\nshould be confined to correcting the illegality. By the same token, however, the district\ncourt was free to discuss the matter of the laboratory fee with the lawyers while they were\npresent to argue the motion and at the continued hearing where the district court imposed\na corrected sentence.\n\n\n       Because no journal entry of judgment had yet been entered, the district court\nproperly included the laboratory fee, along with other costs, in the journal entry of\njudgment filed just after the hearing. The district court plainly had the authority under\nPhillips and Likins to include the fee in the journal entry whether or not the fee had been\n\n                                               8\n\forally ordered during any earlier hearing. The chronology of the various hearings\nfollowed by the filing of the journal entry of judgment including the laboratory fee\nundermines Garrison's argument for relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                          NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                             No. 125,635\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                         STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                             Appellee,\n\n                                                   v.\n\n                                  JOSEPH RANDALL GARRISON,\n                                          Appellant.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Appeal from Leavenworth District Court; GERALD R.

Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) fees are court costs under K.S.A.\n28-176(a)(1). Because KBI fees are not part of the sentence, we find the district court did\nnot lack jurisdiction when it imposed a KBI fee at Joseph Randall Garrison&#x27;s\nresentencing that it had rejected at his original sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Garrison pleaded guilty to attempted possession of methamphetamine as part of a\nplea agreement. The district court accepted Garrison&#x27;s plea and eventually sentenced him\nto 34 months in prison.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the district court initially ordered Garrison to pay a $400 KBI lab\nfee. Defense counsel said he did not believe there was a lab fee. The district court\nbelieved the PSI report showed a lab fee but said if there was not a lab fee then it should\nnot be assessed. The prosecutor informed the district court that it did not look like they\n&quot;ha[d] a lab result back on this one.&quot; Based on this statement, the district court concluded\nthat the KBI lab fee would not be imposed.\n\n\n       Less than a month after sentencing, and before any journal entry or notice of\nappeal was filed, Garrison moved to correct an illegal sentence. He noted that he was\nsentenced for possession of methamphetamine when his crime of conviction was\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. Under K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1),\n&quot;[a]n attempt to commit a felony which prescribes a sentence on the drug grid shall\nreduce the prison term prescribed in the drug grid block for an underlying or completed\ncrime by six months.&quot; Accordingly, he argued, his sentence should have been reduced by\nsix months. The State agreed that Garrison&#x27;s sentence should be reduced.\n\n\n       The district court granted Garrison&#x27;s motion and the case proceeded to\nresentencing. The district court reduced Garrison&#x27;s sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 2021\nSupp. 21-5301(d)(1), resulting in a 28-month prison sentence.\n\n\n       Relevant to this appeal, the $400 KBI lab fee was also discussed. Defense counsel\nstated that he did not believe there was a KBI fee in the case and that it should not be\nimposed. The prosecutor disagreed that there was no KBI fee and stated that she had the\n\n                                              2\n\fKBI lab reports. The prosecutor indicated that she had showed the report to defense\ncounsel, and she believed he agreed regarding the fee. Defense counsel stated his\nagreement by responding, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Defense counsel then stated that he did not receive the\nlab report before the original sentencing, so he thought there was not one. The district\ncourt assessed the $400 KBI lab fee and filed a journal entry reflecting the same. See\nK.S.A. 28-176(a).\n\n\n       Garrison appealed.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction to impose the\nKBI lab fee after it had elected not to do so at the initial sentencing.\n\n\n       Whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law, subject to unlimited appellate\nreview. State v. Hillard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">315 Kan. 732</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">511 P.3d 883</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022).

KBI fees are one of the court costs that can be imposed on a\ndefendant under K.S.A. 28-176(a). In fact, K.S.A. 28-176(a) requires a fee be assessed by\nthe court anytime laboratory services are provided as part of the investigation in the case.\nThe court can only lessen or waive such fees if the defendant is indigent, and the court\nmakes such a finding on the record. K.S.A. 28-176(c). So to the extent laboratory\nservices were provided by the KBI, it would have been error for the district court not to\naccess the related fees.\n\n\n       Moreover, Kansas appellate courts have previously held that costs can be assessed\nafter sentencing. For example, in Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575099\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575099/state-v-phillips/\">289 Kan. 28</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the district court ordered the\ndefendant to pay a docket fee, booking fee, and a Board of Indigents&#x27; Defense Services\n(BIDS) application fee. The district court did not announce the imposition of these costs\nat sentencing. Rather, the district court merely included them in the journal entry of\njudgment. The Kansas Supreme Court found that this practice did not violate the rules\nrequiring a district court to announce a defendant&#x27;s sentence in open court. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575099\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575099/state-v-phillips/\">289 Kan. at\n40</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

We have no\ntrouble finding that the district court had jurisdiction to impose lab fees at the second\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n       Garrison&#x27;s brief also includes a single sentence in which he asserts that the district\ncourt erred in imposing the lab fee &quot;because there was no evidence of &#x27;laboratory services&#x27;\nhaving been provided by the KBI. See K.S.A. 28-176(a).&quot; To the extent Garrison is\nchallenging the factual basis supporting the fee or the existence of a lab report, he did not\n\n                                                4\n\fpreserve this issue. Garrison did not object to the KBI lab fee on these grounds at his\nresentencing hearing. In fact, the brief exchange suggests that defense counsel agreed that\nthe fee should be imposed. So Garrison is raising this issue for the first time on appeal.\nGenerally, issues not raised before the district court cannot be raised on appeal. There are\nseveral exceptions to this rule, but Supreme Court Rule 6.02(a)(5) (2023 Kan. S. Ct.

The Kansas Supreme\nCourt, in turn, has held that a district court need not address, let alone order, the payment\nof statutory costs during a sentencing hearing and may simply include them in the journal\nentry of judgment. State v.

See Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575099\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575099/state-v-phillips/\">289 Kan. at 40</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nRobinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 WL 17172086</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (affirming imposition of $400 laboratory fee,\namong other costs, included in journal entry of judgment even though district court did\nnot mention fee at sentencing). That&#x27;s what effectively happened here. So Garrison&#x27;s point\nis without merit, and the district court&#x27;s order should be affirmed on that basis. I,\ntherefore, concur in the result the majority reaches, but I find its path to that conclusion\nunnecessarily rocky.\n\n\n       As part of an agreement with the State, Garrison pleaded guilty to one count of\nattempted possession of methamphetamine. The State dismissed several other charges. At\nthe sentencing hearing in mid-August 2021, the district court ordered Garrison to serve\n34 months in prison on the mistaken assumption that was the presumptive mid-level\nsentence under the guidelines. The district court denied Garrison&#x27;s request for a\ndispositional departure to probation. During the hearing, the district court asked the\nprosecutor and Garrison&#x27;s lawyer about the statutory laboratory fee. The lawyers told the\ndistrict court they had not seen a lab report and inferred no testing had been done, so no\nfee should be imposed. The district court, therefore, did not orally order Garrison to pay\nthe $400 fee.\n\n\n       On September 7, 2021, Garrison filed a motion to correct the sentence as illegally\nimposed because convictions for attempted drug felonies carry presumptive sentences six\nmonths shorter than for the completed crimes. See K.S.A. 2021 Supp. 21-5301(d)(1). The\nrecord reflects that a journal entry of judgment had not yet been entered. At a hearing on\nthe motion about a week later, the State agreed that the 34-month sentence was illegal.\n\n                                               6\n\fThe district court granted Garrison&#x27;s motion, ordered that a corrected presentence\ninvestigation report be prepared, and continued the matter for what it termed\nresentencing.\n\n\n       At the &quot;resentencing&quot; hearing on September 15, 2021, the district court again\nconsidered and rejected Garrison&#x27;s motion for a dispositional departure and then imposed\na lawful guidelines sentence of 28 months in prison. The district court also raised the\nissue of the statutory laboratory fee. The prosecutor informed the district court a lab\nreport had been received, so Garrison should be ordered to pay the fee. After conferring\nwith the prosecutor, Garrison&#x27;s lawyer agreed there was a lab report and did not object to\nthe fee being assessed. The district court ordered Garrison to pay that fee and other court\ncosts and waived reimbursement of the attorney fees for his appointed lawyer.\n\n\n       A journal entry of judgment that included the $400 laboratory fee was filed on\nSeptember 27, 2021. For some reason, a second journal entry of judgment, also including\nthe $400 laboratory fee and captioned as a journal entry nunc pro tunc, was filed on\nSeptember 23, 2022. Just why the second journal entry was prepared and filed has no\nbearing on this appeal.\n\n\n       Garrison offers a two-fold pitch as to why the district court erred in ordering him\nto pay the $400 laboratory fee. First, Garrison identifies the well-settled rule that when\nthe district court pronounces a lawful sentence from the bench, that sentence cannot later\nbe changed. State v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924155\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971722/state-v-hall/\">298 Kan. 978</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924155\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971722/state-v-hall/\">319 P.3d 506</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014); State v.

As I have indicated, Garrison would then\nhave us apply the rule to the imposition of the laboratory fee. But that aspect of\nGarrison&#x27;s argument is plainly foreclosed by Phillips and Likins.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       For his second line of attack, Garrison says the district court should not have\norally ordered the laboratory fee in handling his motion to correct the illegal sentence\noriginally imposed on him for attempted possession of methamphetamine. In this respect,\nGarrison has a point. But it ultimately doesn&#x27;t get him very far. If a district court grants a\nmotion to correct an illegal sentence, it then has the authority (and, indeed, the duty) to\nimpose a proper sentence. But that is the extent of its authority. See State v. Guder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923227\"><a href=\"/opinion/7970843/state-v-guder/\">293\nKan. 763</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923227\"><a href=\"/opinion/7970843/state-v-guder/\">267 P.3d 751</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (when sentence on one conviction is vacated as\nillegal, district court on remand has no authority to modify lawful sentences already\nimposed on other convictions). So granting Garrison&#x27;s motion did not occasion a new\nsentencing hearing to reconsider and again rule on anything and everything that typically\nwould be disposed of during such a hearing. (The term &quot;sentencing hearing&quot; is shorthand\nfor the proceeding following conviction in which the district court imposes punishment\non a defendant. But the district court typically also addresses and resolves various\nnonpunitive matters, including the imposition of court costs, such as the laboratory fee,\nand reimbursement of attorney fees for appointed counsel.)\n\n\n       The district court, therefore, likely erred in orally ordering Garrison to pay the\nlaboratory fee in conjunction with correcting his sentence. And the majority has likely\nstrayed in endorsing the notion that a full &quot;resentencing&quot; necessarily follows when the\ndistrict court grants a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The remedy presumably\nshould be confined to correcting the illegality. By the same token, however, the district\ncourt was free to discuss the matter of the laboratory fee with the lawyers while they were\npresent to argue the motion and at the continued hearing where the district court imposed\na corrected sentence.\n\n\n       Because no journal entry of judgment had yet been entered, the district court\nproperly included the laboratory fee, along with other costs, in the journal entry of\njudgment filed just after the hearing. The district court plainly had the authority under\nPhillips and Likins to include the fee in the journal entry whether or not the fee had been\n\n                                               8\n\forally ordered during any earlier hearing. The chronology of the various hearings\nfollowed by the filing of the journal entry of judgment including the laboratory fee\nundermines Garrison&#x27;s argument for relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2575099/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2604089/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2607275/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4402496/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923227/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924155/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924161/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925373/", "id": 9925373, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467535/state-v-jesse/", "cluster_id": 9467535, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467535/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:05:10.074578-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:26:29.967038-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "cfddb95ef174bbfea990b904ad933feba6b42c8f", "page_count": 11, "download_url": "https://www.kscourts.org/KSCourts/media/KsCourts/Opinions/125826.pdf?ext=.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/state_v._jesse.pdf", "plain_text": "                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,826\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                    v.\n\n                                        BRIAN CURTIS JESSE,\n                                            Appellant.\n\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Shawnee District Court; BRETT A.

LAHEY, S.J.\n\n\n        ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J.: Brian Curtis Jesse appeals the district court's decision to\nrevoke his probation and impose the underlying sentence. First, he contests the\nconclusion that he violated probation by committing the offense of interference with law\nenforcement. Second, he argues that his underlying prison sentence violates equal\nprotection principles. After reviewing the issues presented, we affirm the district court's\ndecision to revoke Jesse's probation and impose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Jesse agreed to plead guilty in Shawnee County to one felony count of possession\nof less than one gram of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute. The plea\nagreement anticipated that his criminal history would be an E, which would place Jesse in\na border box on the sentencing grid. The State agreed not to oppose border box findings\nif Jesse could produce evidence to support such findings. The district court accepted\nJesse's plea and ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\n\n       The PSI report reflected that Jesse had a criminal history score of C, because of a\nprior person felony conviction for attempted aggravated burglary in 2015. Jesse moved\nfor a downward dispositional or durational departure. He argued in part that the age and\nnature of his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction justified a departure because\nlegislative changes in 2016 made it so that his underlying conduct\u2014shoplifting from a\nWal-Mart after being banned from the store\u2014would no longer be considered aggravated\nburglary under current law. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-5807; L. 2016, ch. 90, \u00a7 3\n(amending definition of burglary to exclude \"entering into or remaining in a retail or\ncommercial premises at any time that it is open to the public after having received a\npersonal communication from the owner or manager of such premises not to enter such\npremises\"). To support this point Jesse included a copy of the complaint, which showed a\ncharge in 2014 for aggravated burglary based on an alleged shoplifting at Walmart after\nhe had been banned, as described in his motion.\n\n\n       The district court ultimately granted Jesse's motion for a dispositional departure,\nimposing an underlying 42-month prison sentence based on his C criminal history score,\nsuspended for an 18-month probation term. The district court explained that the\n\"strongest reason\" to grant a departure was that his prior conviction would have been\ncharged differently under current law. The district court also stated it would authorize the\ntransfer of Jesse's probation to Clay County because Jesse resided there.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Just three months later, the State moved to revoke Jesse's probation, alleging he\nhad failed to report to his probation officer and that he had committed a new felony\noffense of interference with law enforcement. At the hearing on the motion, the State\ncalled several witnesses and Jesse testified on his own behalf.\n\n\n       As to Jesse's alleged failure to report, his probation officer testified that she was\nassigned to Jesse's case on the day of sentencing. Jesse did not report as required after\nsentencing, so she sent him a letter to his address in Clay Center, directing him to report\nin Shawnee County on June 1, 2022. She received no response, but Jesse met with her in\nperson on the required date\u2014a clear indication that he had received the letter. She\nexplained the standard terms of probation and directed him to return a week later to\ncomplete an assessment, but Jesse failed to report as directed. She sent another letter to\nJesse's address in Clay Center on June 20, 2022, directing him to report on June 27, 2022.\nShe had no further contact with Jesse after that. According to her notes, Jesse's probation\ndid not include a transfer, but he did set a goal \"that he needs to get out of Clay Center.\"\nShe had no record of a transfer of probation to Clay County but said she usually tells her\nprobationers they must report to her before any transfer and that some counties require\ncompletion of a risk assessment for a transfer.\n\n\n       As to the interference with law enforcement charge, Clay Center Police Chief Bill\nRobinson testified that he received a tip on July 20, 2022, that someone resembling Cade\nSchultz\u2014who had an active felony arrest warrant\u2014had ridden his motorcycle into the\ngarage at Jesse's residence. Robinson went there and knocked on the front door while a\ndeputy kept watch at the back door. Two young children answered the door and\nresponded, \"Yes\" when Chief Robinson asked if Schultz was inside. Robinson asked if he\ncould speak to Schultz and the children again responded, \"Yes\" before closing the door.\n\n\n       After waiting a bit, Robinson knocked on the door again and Jesse answered.\nRobinson explained to Jesse that he had received a tip about Schultz and that the children\n\n                                              3\n\fhad just said Schultz was inside. Jesse responded that Schultz and his girlfriend had been\nthere earlier but left before Robinson arrived. Robinson clarified to Jesse that he believed\nhe had probable cause to get a warrant to search the house, so it would be a felony if\nJesse was discovered harboring a fugitive of a felony arrest warrant. Robinson said he\ntold Jesse to send Schultz out or they would obtain a search warrant. Jesse said he\nunderstood and went back inside, closing the door.\n\n\n       Robinson called for additional officers to surround the house, while he went back\nto his office to apply for a search warrant. Once the warrant was granted, he returned to\nJesse's house. As he was walking up to the house, Robinson heard officers yelling that\nSchultz had exited the house and was running. After apprehending Schultz, the officers\narrested Jesse for interference with law enforcement.\n\n\n       Jesse admitted that he last met with his probation officer on June 1, 2022, saying\nhe had no further contact with her after that meeting because he believed his probation\nwas being transferred to Clay County. Jesse denied receiving any other letters after the\nJune 1 meeting. Jesse said he tried to call his probation officer, but she never answered.\nHe did not report in Shawnee County due to not having a valid driver's license to\ntransport himself from Clay Center. Jesse testified that he did not know Schultz was still\npresent when he first spoke with Robinson and only found out after the conversation.\nJesse did not send Schultz outside or tell the officers because Schultz \"wouldn't let [him]\ngo outside.\"\n\n\n       At the end of the hearing, the district court found, based on the evidence\npresented, that Jesse had violated his probation by failing to report and remain law\nabiding. In particular, the district court found Jesse's testimony lacked credibility,\nincluding both in his statements that he believed his probation was being transferred to\nClay County and that he was unaware of Schultz' presence when he first spoke to\nRobinson. The district court found it was \"more likely to believe that the defendant was\n\n                                              4\n\faware of that fact, and closed the door, misinformed the law enforcement officers about\n[Schultz'] presence in the house for the specific purpose of thwarting the execution of\nservice of process.\"\n\n\n       Jesse opposed revocation of probation, but recognized that the district court could\ndo so and order him to serve his underlying sentence without imposing sanctions because\nhe had received a departure sentence. The district court revoked Jesse's probation and\nordered him to serve the underlying prison sentence, based on the two established\nprobation violations.\n\n\n       Jesse timely appeals.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n          THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REVOKING JESSE'S PROBATION\n\n       Typically, the procedure for revoking a defendant's probation requires two distinct\ninquiries by the district court: (1) a factual determination that the offender violated a\ncondition of probation; and (2) a discretionary determination of the appropriate\ndisposition given the established violation. State v. Horton, 308 Kan. 757, 760-61, 423\nP.3d 548 (2018) (citing State v. Skolaut, 286 Kan. 219, 227-28, 182 P.3d 1231 [2008]).\n\n\n       Under the first step, the State must establish a probation violation by a\npreponderance of the evidence. State v. Inkelaar, 38 Kan. App. 2d 312, 315, 164 P.3d\n844 (2007). \"A preponderance of the evidence is established when the evidence\ndemonstrates a fact is more probably true than not true.\" 38 Kan. App. 2d at 315.\nAppellate courts review a district court's factual findings for substantial competent\nevidence and then determine de novo whether those findings support the district court's\nlegal conclusions. State v. Weber, 297 Kan. 805, 816, 304 P.3d 1262 (2013). Substantial\n\n                                              5\n\fcompetent evidence is legal and relevant evidence that a reasonable person could accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion. State v. May, 293 Kan. 858, 862, 269 P.3d 1260\n(2012). When reviewing for substantial competent evidence, appellate courts do not\nreweigh the evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses. State v. Combs, 280 Kan. 45,\n50, 118 P.3d 1259 (2005).\n\n\n       Once a probation violation has been established, the appropriate disposition rests\nwithin the district court's sound discretion unless an intermediate sanction is statutorily\nrequired. State v. Tafolla, 315 Kan. 324, 328, 508 P.3d 351 (2022); see K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 22-3716(b) and (c) (requiring graduated sanctions before revocation in certain\ncircumstances). Judicial discretion is abused when its decision is (1) arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable; (2) based on an error of law; or (3) based on an error of fact. State v.\nIngham, 308 Kan. 1466, 1469, 430 P.3d 931 (2018). Jesse bears the burden of showing\nan abuse of discretion. See State v. Thomas, 307 Kan. 733, 739, 415 P.3d 430 (2018). It is\nnot disputed that an intermediate sanction was not required here because Jesse was on\nprobation due to a dispositional departure by the sentencing judge. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       Here, the district court found Jesse violated his probation in two ways: (1) by\nfailing to report to his probation officer; and (2) by committing the offense of interference\nwith law enforcement. Although Jesse recognizes both violations in his brief, he only\nchallenges the district court's conclusion that he violated probation by not remaining law\nabiding. Kansas appellate courts have long followed the rule that issues not briefed by an\nappellant are considered waived or abandoned. State v. Davis, 313 Kan. 244, 248, 485\nP.3d 174 (2021). Likewise, points raised incidentally in a brief and not argued in it are\nseen as abandoned. State v. Meggerson, 312 Kan. 238, 246, 474 P.3d 761 (2020).\n\n\n       Since Jesse does not challenge the district court's finding that he violated probation\nby failing to report, we find he has abandoned that challenge. So we are left with whether\n\n                                              6\n\fthe district court would have revoked Jesse's probation had the failure to report been the\nonly violation. If so, the district court's unchallenged finding is dispositive. See Quinn v.\nState, 317 Kan. 624, 627, 537 P. 3d 94 (2023) (where unchallenged ground for court's\ndecision was dispositive, no need to address other grounds).\n\n\n       We have no problem concluding that Jesse's failure to report and to pursue\nrehabilitation would have resulted in the revocation of his probation even absent the\nalleged failure to remain law abiding. The court discussed at length the fact that Jesse's\nprobation was the result of a dispositional departure\u2014a departure that was granted due to\nthe court's belief that Jesse warranted an opportunity to be free and pursue rehabilitation.\nAlthough the district court was specific in its finding that Jesse's failure to complete drug\ntreatment was not the basis for the revocation, the court found it relevant that Jesse had\ndone nothing to even pursue it. The court noted that Jesse had failed to follow through\nwith this foundational promise he made to the court to convince it to grant a departure\nsentence\u2014an indication that he was no longer amenable to probation, and he should\nserve his underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to revoke Jesse's probation.\n\n\n   JESSE CANNOT USE A MOTION TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE TO ARGUE HIS\n                 UNDERLYING SENTENCE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n       Although he combines their discussion, Jesse raises two arguments here: (1) The\nrevised Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6801 et seq.,\nis unconstitutional because it violates his equal protection rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and sections one and two of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights; and (2) his sentence is illegal because it does not conform to\nthe KSGA.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       Yet Jesse acknowledges that the correct application of the KSGA requires\ndesignating his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction as a person felony since\nthe crime was designated as such at the time of his current conviction. See State v.\nTerrell, 315 Kan. 68, Syl. \u00b6 2, 504 P.3d 405 (2022) (\"Under the Kansas Sentencing\nGuidelines Act, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6801 et seq., all prior convictions, whether out-of-\nstate, pre-guidelines, or amended post-guidelines, are to be classified as person or\nnonperson as of the time the new crime is committed.\"); State v. Lyon, 58 Kan. App. 2d\n474, 492, 471 P.3d 716 (2020) (affirming designation of 2010 aggravated burglary\nconviction as a person felony since the crime as amended in 2016 remained a person\nfelony). In other words, Jesse concedes the district court did not err in calculating his\ncriminal history score under the KSGA, but he contends that if his Kansas conviction for\nattempted aggravated burglary had been committed in 1992 instead of 2015, he would\nbenefit from a more lenient criminal history calculus. In that case his sentence would\nhave been calculated based on a lower criminal history score. Because the KSGA treats\nhim differently than people with convictions for the same crime before the KSGA's\nexistence, Jesse claims his sentence \"does not afford [him] equal protection.\"\n\n\n       This leaves Jesse solely with the argument that the KSGA is unconstitutional as it\napplies to his situation. But fatal to this argument is the well-established Kansas Supreme\nCourt mandate that a criminal defendant cannot use a motion to correct illegal sentence to\nargue their sentence is unconstitutional. See State v. Bryant, 310 Kan. 920, 922-23, 453\nP.3d 279 (2019) (holding that motion to correct an illegal sentence is an inappropriate\nvehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a sentence). Accordingly, we cannot consider\nhis constitutional claim at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n\n       In sum, we affirm the district court's decision to revoke Jesse's probation and\nimpose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n                                              8\n\f                                            ***\n\n\n       ATCHESON, J., concurring: The Shawnee County District Court acted within its\njudicial discretion to revoke Defendant Brian Curtis Jesse's probation. So I concur in\naffirming that decision and briefly elaborate on what I understand to be our reasoning for\nthat result.\n\n\n       In an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Jesse violated the conditions\nof probation when he failed to report to his probation officer as required and when he\ncommitted the new crime of interference with law enforcement, a violation of K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904(a)(3), by impeding Clay Center police officers in their efforts to\ncapture a fugitive. The district court revoked Jesse's probation and ordered him to serve\nhis original 42-month prison sentence for possession of methamphetamine with the intent\nto distribute. When the district court originally sentenced Jesse, it granted him a\ndispositional departure from presumptive imprisonment to probation. The district court,\ntherefore, had the authority to order Jesse to serve the prison sentence upon a proved\nprobation violation, bypassing lesser jail sanctions typically required for first violations.\nSee K.S.A. 22-3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       On appeal, Jesse does not dispute that he failed to report and, thus, concedes that\nprobation violation. But he submits the evidence did not establish that he violated K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904. See State v. Gumfory, 281 Kan. 1168, 1170, 135 P.3d 1191 (2006)\n(State bears burden of proving probation violation by preponderance of evidence). For\npurposes of resolving the appeal, the majority assumes Jesse is correct in that respect and\nconsiders whether the district court would have revoked the probation for the failure to\nreport as a stand-alone violation. Under the circumstances, that is analytically sufficient.\nThe majority then correctly points out the district court had the statutory right to revoke\nJesse's probation and to order him to serve his prison sentence. In other words, the district\n\n\n                                              9\n\fcourt could have chosen to do so in the exercise of its judicial discretion. But that doesn't\nresolve the issue.\n\n\n       To affirm the district court's decision, we must be able to say the district court\nwould have exercised its discretion in that way based solely on Jesse's failure to report\u2014\nthe sort of violation commonly considered a \"technical\" one. See State v. Brown, 51 Kan.\nApp. 2d 876, 880, 357 P.3d 296 (2015) (technical violation entails conduct contrary to\nconditions of probation but not otherwise unlawful); State v. Torres, No. 125,142, 2023\nWL 6324394, at *5 (Kan. App. 2023) (unpublished opinion). So the outcome\ndeterminative question is this: Would the district court, in fact, have revoked Jesse for the\ntechnical violation? Not whether it legally could have done so.\n\n\n       To answer the controlling question, we must be able to reasonably conclude from\nthe record how the district court would have exercised its judicial discretion in a factual\ncircumstance at least somewhat different from the one it did consider. Otherwise, we are\nsimply guessing about what the district court might have done. Appellate courts cannot\ndeploy mere guesswork to supersede a discretionary call a district court never actually\nmade. Cf. State v. Herring, 312 Kan. 192, 201, 474 P.3d 285 (2020) (Although a\nreviewing court \"may think\" it knows what a district court would have done absent a\nlegal error, \"it cannot know for sure until the lower court does the [proper] analysis.\");\nState v. Jackson, No. 124,540, 2023 WL 176079, at *3 (Kan. App.) (unpublished\nopinion) (when district court makes legal error in exercising judicial discretion, appellate\ncourt typically should remand for further consideration), rev. denied 317 Kan. 846\n(2023).\n\n\n       Here, however, we do not have to guess. In explaining its decision to revoke\nJesse's probation and to send him to prison rather than extending his probation, the\ndistrict court expressly relied on the failure to report and a failure to engage in drug\ncounseling or treatment. In that context, the district court did not mention Jesse's\n\n                                              10\n\fostensible interference with the Clay Center police officers. We, therefore, may\nreasonably conclude the district court would have done exactly what it did do even in the\nabsence of the probation violation for interference. See State v. Wilson, 314 Kan. 517,\n524, 501 P.3d 885 (2022) (appellate court declines to infer district court would have\nrevoked probation based on available legal grounds it \"did not refer to or make findings\nunder\"). Accordingly, the record is sufficient to affirm the district court's ruling while\ngiving full play to the analytical assumption discarding the new-crime violation.\n\n\n       As to Jesse's second issue, I agree that he gets no relief at this juncture on his\nclaim that the determination of his original sentence and the underlying criminal history\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and, thus, did not conform to the Kansas sentencing guidelines. In an appeal\nfrom a probation revocation, a defendant cannot challenge the legal bases for the original\nsentence. Wilkerson v. State, 38 Kan. App. 2d 732, 734, 171 P.3d 671 (2007); State v.\nResto-Isaac, No. 122,226, 2021 WL 2387474, at *4 (Kan. App. 2021) (unpublished\nopinion). If we were to construe the point as a request to correct an illegal sentence under\nK.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-3504, it would fail because that statutory remedy does not cover\nconstitutional challenges to a sentence. State v. Bryant, 310 Kan. 920, 922, 453 P.3d 279\n(2019).\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,826\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                    v.\n\n                                        BRIAN CURTIS JESSE,\n                                            Appellant.\n\n\n                                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Shawnee District Court; BRETT A.

Dunn, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, for appellant.\n\n\n        Jodi Litfin, deputy district attorney, Michael Kagay, district attorney, and Kris W. Kobach,\nattorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., ATCHESON, J., and TIMOTHY G. LAHEY, S.J.\n\n\n        ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J.: Brian Curtis Jesse appeals the district court&#x27;s decision to\nrevoke his probation and impose the underlying sentence. First, he contests the\nconclusion that he violated probation by committing the offense of interference with law\nenforcement. Second, he argues that his underlying prison sentence violates equal\nprotection principles. After reviewing the issues presented, we affirm the district court&#x27;s\ndecision to revoke Jesse&#x27;s probation and impose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       Jesse agreed to plead guilty in Shawnee County to one felony count of possession\nof less than one gram of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute. The plea\nagreement anticipated that his criminal history would be an E, which would place Jesse in\na border box on the sentencing grid. The State agreed not to oppose border box findings\nif Jesse could produce evidence to support such findings. The district court accepted\nJesse&#x27;s plea and ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\n\n       The PSI report reflected that Jesse had a criminal history score of C, because of a\nprior person felony conviction for attempted aggravated burglary in 2015. Jesse moved\nfor a downward dispositional or durational departure. He argued in part that the age and\nnature of his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction justified a departure because\nlegislative changes in 2016 made it so that his underlying conduct\u2014shoplifting from a\nWal-Mart after being banned from the store\u2014would no longer be considered aggravated\nburglary under current law. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-5807; L. 2016, ch. 90, \u00a7 3\n(amending definition of burglary to exclude &quot;entering into or remaining in a retail or\ncommercial premises at any time that it is open to the public after having received a\npersonal communication from the owner or manager of such premises not to enter such\npremises&quot;). To support this point Jesse included a copy of the complaint, which showed a\ncharge in 2014 for aggravated burglary based on an alleged shoplifting at Walmart after\nhe had been banned, as described in his motion.\n\n\n       The district court ultimately granted Jesse&#x27;s motion for a dispositional departure,\nimposing an underlying 42-month prison sentence based on his C criminal history score,\nsuspended for an 18-month probation term. The district court explained that the\n&quot;strongest reason&quot; to grant a departure was that his prior conviction would have been\ncharged differently under current law. The district court also stated it would authorize the\ntransfer of Jesse&#x27;s probation to Clay County because Jesse resided there.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Just three months later, the State moved to revoke Jesse&#x27;s probation, alleging he\nhad failed to report to his probation officer and that he had committed a new felony\noffense of interference with law enforcement. At the hearing on the motion, the State\ncalled several witnesses and Jesse testified on his own behalf.\n\n\n       As to Jesse&#x27;s alleged failure to report, his probation officer testified that she was\nassigned to Jesse&#x27;s case on the day of sentencing. Jesse did not report as required after\nsentencing, so she sent him a letter to his address in Clay Center, directing him to report\nin Shawnee County on June 1, 2022. She received no response, but Jesse met with her in\nperson on the required date\u2014a clear indication that he had received the letter. She\nexplained the standard terms of probation and directed him to return a week later to\ncomplete an assessment, but Jesse failed to report as directed. She sent another letter to\nJesse&#x27;s address in Clay Center on June 20, 2022, directing him to report on June 27, 2022.\nShe had no further contact with Jesse after that. According to her notes, Jesse&#x27;s probation\ndid not include a transfer, but he did set a goal &quot;that he needs to get out of Clay Center.&quot;\nShe had no record of a transfer of probation to Clay County but said she usually tells her\nprobationers they must report to her before any transfer and that some counties require\ncompletion of a risk assessment for a transfer.\n\n\n       As to the interference with law enforcement charge, Clay Center Police Chief Bill\nRobinson testified that he received a tip on July 20, 2022, that someone resembling Cade\nSchultz\u2014who had an active felony arrest warrant\u2014had ridden his motorcycle into the\ngarage at Jesse&#x27;s residence. Robinson went there and knocked on the front door while a\ndeputy kept watch at the back door. Two young children answered the door and\nresponded, &quot;Yes&quot; when Chief Robinson asked if Schultz was inside. Robinson asked if he\ncould speak to Schultz and the children again responded, &quot;Yes&quot; before closing the door.\n\n\n       After waiting a bit, Robinson knocked on the door again and Jesse answered.\nRobinson explained to Jesse that he had received a tip about Schultz and that the children\n\n                                              3\n\fhad just said Schultz was inside. Jesse responded that Schultz and his girlfriend had been\nthere earlier but left before Robinson arrived. Robinson clarified to Jesse that he believed\nhe had probable cause to get a warrant to search the house, so it would be a felony if\nJesse was discovered harboring a fugitive of a felony arrest warrant. Robinson said he\ntold Jesse to send Schultz out or they would obtain a search warrant. Jesse said he\nunderstood and went back inside, closing the door.\n\n\n       Robinson called for additional officers to surround the house, while he went back\nto his office to apply for a search warrant. Once the warrant was granted, he returned to\nJesse&#x27;s house. As he was walking up to the house, Robinson heard officers yelling that\nSchultz had exited the house and was running. After apprehending Schultz, the officers\narrested Jesse for interference with law enforcement.\n\n\n       Jesse admitted that he last met with his probation officer on June 1, 2022, saying\nhe had no further contact with her after that meeting because he believed his probation\nwas being transferred to Clay County. Jesse denied receiving any other letters after the\nJune 1 meeting. Jesse said he tried to call his probation officer, but she never answered.\nHe did not report in Shawnee County due to not having a valid driver&#x27;s license to\ntransport himself from Clay Center. Jesse testified that he did not know Schultz was still\npresent when he first spoke with Robinson and only found out after the conversation.\nJesse did not send Schultz outside or tell the officers because Schultz &quot;wouldn&#x27;t let [him]\ngo outside.&quot;\n\n\n       At the end of the hearing, the district court found, based on the evidence\npresented, that Jesse had violated his probation by failing to report and remain law\nabiding. In particular, the district court found Jesse&#x27;s testimony lacked credibility,\nincluding both in his statements that he believed his probation was being transferred to\nClay County and that he was unaware of Schultz&#x27; presence when he first spoke to\nRobinson. The district court found it was &quot;more likely to believe that the defendant was\n\n                                              4\n\faware of that fact, and closed the door, misinformed the law enforcement officers about\n[Schultz&#x27;] presence in the house for the specific purpose of thwarting the execution of\nservice of process.&quot;\n\n\n       Jesse opposed revocation of probation, but recognized that the district court could\ndo so and order him to serve his underlying sentence without imposing sanctions because\nhe had received a departure sentence. The district court revoked Jesse&#x27;s probation and\nordered him to serve the underlying prison sentence, based on the two established\nprobation violations.\n\n\n       Jesse timely appeals.\n\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n\n          THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REVOKING JESSE&#x27;S PROBATION\n\n       Typically, the procedure for revoking a defendant&#x27;s probation requires two distinct\ninquiries by the district court: (1) a factual determination that the offender violated a\ncondition of probation; and (2) a discretionary determination of the appropriate\ndisposition given the established violation.

It is\nnot disputed that an intermediate sanction was not required here because Jesse was on\nprobation due to a dispositional departure by the sentencing judge. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       Here, the district court found Jesse violated his probation in two ways: (1) by\nfailing to report to his probation officer; and (2) by committing the offense of interference\nwith law enforcement. Although Jesse recognizes both violations in his brief, he only\nchallenges the district court&#x27;s conclusion that he violated probation by not remaining law\nabiding. Kansas appellate courts have long followed the rule that issues not briefed by an\nappellant are considered waived or abandoned. State v.

So we are left with whether\n\n                                              6\n\fthe district court would have revoked Jesse&#x27;s probation had the failure to report been the\nonly violation. If so, the district court&#x27;s unchallenged finding is dispositive. See Quinn v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">317 Kan. 624</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">537 P. 3d 94</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2023) (where unchallenged ground for court&#x27;s\ndecision was dispositive, no need to address other grounds).\n\n\n       We have no problem concluding that Jesse&#x27;s failure to report and to pursue\nrehabilitation would have resulted in the revocation of his probation even absent the\nalleged failure to remain law abiding. The court discussed at length the fact that Jesse&#x27;s\nprobation was the result of a dispositional departure\u2014a departure that was granted due to\nthe court&#x27;s belief that Jesse warranted an opportunity to be free and pursue rehabilitation.\nAlthough the district court was specific in its finding that Jesse&#x27;s failure to complete drug\ntreatment was not the basis for the revocation, the court found it relevant that Jesse had\ndone nothing to even pursue it. The court noted that Jesse had failed to follow through\nwith this foundational promise he made to the court to convince it to grant a departure\nsentence\u2014an indication that he was no longer amenable to probation, and he should\nserve his underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court&#x27;s decision to revoke Jesse&#x27;s probation.\n\n\n   JESSE CANNOT USE A MOTION TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE TO ARGUE HIS\n                 UNDERLYING SENTENCE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n       Although he combines their discussion, Jesse raises two arguments here: (1) The\nrevised Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6801 et seq.,\nis unconstitutional because it violates his equal protection rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and sections one and two of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights; and (2) his sentence is illegal because it does not conform to\nthe KSGA.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       Yet Jesse acknowledges that the correct application of the KSGA requires\ndesignating his 2015 attempted aggravated burglary conviction as a person felony since\nthe crime was designated as such at the time of his current conviction. See State v.\nTerrell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">315 Kan. 68</span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. \u00b6 2, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">504 P.3d 405</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022) (&quot;Under the Kansas Sentencing\nGuidelines Act, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6801 et seq., all prior convictions, whether out-of-\nstate, pre-guidelines, or amended post-guidelines, are to be classified as person or\nnonperson as of the time the new crime is committed.&quot;); State v. Lyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">58 Kan. App. 2d\n474</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">471 P.3d 716</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2020) (affirming designation of 2010 aggravated burglary\nconviction as a person felony since the crime as amended in 2016 remained a person\nfelony). In other words, Jesse concedes the district court did not err in calculating his\ncriminal history score under the KSGA, but he contends that if his Kansas conviction for\nattempted aggravated burglary had been committed in 1992 instead of 2015, he would\nbenefit from a more lenient criminal history calculus. In that case his sentence would\nhave been calculated based on a lower criminal history score. Because the KSGA treats\nhim differently than people with convictions for the same crime before the KSGA&#x27;s\nexistence, Jesse claims his sentence &quot;does not afford [him] equal protection.&quot;\n\n\n       This leaves Jesse solely with the argument that the KSGA is unconstitutional as it\napplies to his situation. But fatal to this argument is the well-established Kansas Supreme\nCourt mandate that a criminal defendant cannot use a motion to correct illegal sentence to\nargue their sentence is unconstitutional. See State v. Bryant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">310 Kan. 920</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922-23, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">453\nP.3d 279</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2019) (holding that motion to correct an illegal sentence is an inappropriate\nvehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a sentence). Accordingly, we cannot consider\nhis constitutional claim at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n\n       In sum, we affirm the district court&#x27;s decision to revoke Jesse&#x27;s probation and\nimpose the underlying sentence.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n                                              8\n\f                                            ***\n\n\n       ATCHESON, J., concurring: The Shawnee County District Court acted within its\njudicial discretion to revoke Defendant Brian Curtis Jesse&#x27;s probation. So I concur in\naffirming that decision and briefly elaborate on what I understand to be our reasoning for\nthat result.\n\n\n       In an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Jesse violated the conditions\nof probation when he failed to report to his probation officer as required and when he\ncommitted the new crime of interference with law enforcement, a violation of K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904(a)(3), by impeding Clay Center police officers in their efforts to\ncapture a fugitive. The district court revoked Jesse&#x27;s probation and ordered him to serve\nhis original 42-month prison sentence for possession of methamphetamine with the intent\nto distribute. When the district court originally sentenced Jesse, it granted him a\ndispositional departure from presumptive imprisonment to probation. The district court,\ntherefore, had the authority to order Jesse to serve the prison sentence upon a proved\nprobation violation, bypassing lesser jail sanctions typically required for first violations.\nSee K.S.A. 22-3716(c)(7)(B).\n\n\n       On appeal, Jesse does not dispute that he failed to report and, thus, concedes that\nprobation violation. But he submits the evidence did not establish that he violated K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-5904. See State v. Gumfory, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639546/state-v-gumfory/\">281 Kan. 1168</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1170, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639546/state-v-gumfory/\">135 P.3d 1191</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006)\n(State bears burden of proving probation violation by preponderance of evidence). For\npurposes of resolving the appeal, the majority assumes Jesse is correct in that respect and\nconsiders whether the district court would have revoked the probation for the failure to\nreport as a stand-alone violation. Under the circumstances, that is analytically sufficient.\nThe majority then correctly points out the district court had the statutory right to revoke\nJesse&#x27;s probation and to order him to serve his prison sentence. In other words, the district\n\n\n                                              9\n\fcourt could have chosen to do so in the exercise of its judicial discretion. But that doesn&#x27;t\nresolve the issue.\n\n\n       To affirm the district court&#x27;s decision, we must be able to say the district court\nwould have exercised its discretion in that way based solely on Jesse&#x27;s failure to report\u2014\nthe sort of violation commonly considered a &quot;technical&quot; one. See State v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2851416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2851416/state-v-brown/\">51 Kan.\nApp. 2d 876</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 880, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2851416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2851416/state-v-brown/\">357 P.3d 296</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015) (technical violation entails conduct contrary to\nconditions of probation but not otherwise unlawful); State v.

So the outcome\ndeterminative question is this: Would the district court, in fact, have revoked Jesse for the\ntechnical violation? Not whether it legally could have done so.\n\n\n       To answer the controlling question, we must be able to reasonably conclude from\nthe record how the district court would have exercised its judicial discretion in a factual\ncircumstance at least somewhat different from the one it did consider. Otherwise, we are\nsimply guessing about what the district court might have done. Appellate courts cannot\ndeploy mere guesswork to supersede a discretionary call a district court never actually\nmade. Cf. State v. Herring, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">312 Kan. 192</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">474 P.3d 285</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2020) (Although a\nreviewing court &quot;may think&quot; it knows what a district court would have done absent a\nlegal error, &quot;it cannot know for sure until the lower court does the [proper] analysis.&quot;);\nState v.

In explaining its decision to revoke\nJesse&#x27;s probation and to send him to prison rather than extending his probation, the\ndistrict court expressly relied on the failure to report and a failure to engage in drug\ncounseling or treatment. In that context, the district court did not mention Jesse&#x27;s\n\n                                              10\n\fostensible interference with the Clay Center police officers. We, therefore, may\nreasonably conclude the district court would have done exactly what it did do even in the\nabsence of the probation violation for interference. See State v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">314 Kan. 517</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n524, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">501 P.3d 885</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022) (appellate court declines to infer district court would have\nrevoked probation based on available legal grounds it &quot;did not refer to or make findings\nunder&quot;). Accordingly, the record is sufficient to affirm the district court&#x27;s ruling while\ngiving full play to the analytical assumption discarding the new-crime violation.\n\n\n       As to Jesse&#x27;s second issue, I agree that he gets no relief at this juncture on his\nclaim that the determination of his original sentence and the underlying criminal history\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and, thus, did not conform to the Kansas sentencing guidelines. In an appeal\nfrom a probation revocation, a defendant cannot challenge the legal bases for the original\nsentence. Wilkerson v.

Kellner of aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child for his inappropriate touching of the six-year-old victim. He was sentenced\nto the statutory penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years served before\nany possibility of parole. On appeal Kellner claims that his conviction should be\nreversed, and he is entitled to a new trial because trial errors from prosecutorial missteps\nto erroneous jury instructions deprived him of a fair trial. In the event this court was\nunpersuaded to reverse the jury's decision based on those alleged errors, he also argues\nthat the district court abused its discretion by denying him a durational or dispositional\n\n                                                    1\n\fdeparture from the presumptive sentence. Despite the litany of errors asserted, this court\nfinds no reversible error and affirms Kellner's conviction and sentence.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On February 27, 2019, the State charged Timothy E. Kellner with two counts of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, arising from his alleged abuse of a then six-\nyear-old child on or between February 21 to 22, 2019, and sometime on or between\nDecember 25, 2018, and February 20, 2019. Although the State dismissed one of the\ncounts, after a trial in January 2022 the jury found Kellner guilty of one count of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child. Among Kellner\u2019s many allegations, he claims\nthere was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions, which requires this court to\nrecite the relevant facts underlying his conviction.\n\n\n       At trial the victim testified that she told her mom that Kellner \"had touched me in\nmy private\" and that her mom took her to talk to the police. The victim said that when she\nwas in her bed in the basement Kellner \"came in my room and laid beside me and started\nto pull down my pants. And then [he] had touched me\" with his \"arm and his hand\" on\nthe butt. She later testified that Kellner also pulled down her underwear at that time. On\ncross-examination the victim confirmed that Kellner touched her once in this manner.\n\n\n       The victim's mother testified that on the night of February 21, 2019, she and the\nvictim, her daughter, had fallen asleep on the living room couches, but she awoke at\nabout 12:30-1:00 a.m. and went to bed while her daughter continued to sleep on the\ncouch. The next day, on February 22, 2019, the victim's mother and her friend were in the\nliving room when the victim \"described a scenario from the evening before, at which\n[Kellner] caressed in between her legs with . . . what she believes is his arm.\" The\nvictim's mother and her friend took the victim to a police substation and met an officer\nwho interviewed the mother and her friend. The Axon video footage of that police\n\n                                              2\n\finterview was admitted at trial. On cross-examination, the victim's mother testified that at\nthat time she wanted to talk to Kellner because she did not want to jump to conclusions\nbut confirmed the officer did not allow her to talk to Kellner.\n\n\n       The officer transported the victim and her mother to the Child Advocacy Center\n(CAC) where the victim was interviewed outside the presence of her mother. The officer\nlater transported the victim and her mother to the hospital where nurses photographed and\nswabbed the victim.\n\n\n       The forensic nurse examined the victim at the hospital from 12:32 a.m. until after\n1:30 a.m. and documented on a diagram admitted into evidence that the victim had \"red,\npurple bruise with swelling\" on the labia majora and \"excess skin to the anal area\" in the\ntop part of her anus. The forensic nurse also confirmed that she took swabs from the\nvictim's labia majora where the bruising was seen, her labia minora, anal area, and the\nspace between her anus and vagina, as well as an oral swab so that they could gather the\nvictim's genetic information and compare it to any genetic material found elsewhere on\nher body. The forensic nurse confirmed that she did not see any pubic hairs, lubricants, or\nclothing fibers on the victim. She also confirmed that it was possible for a man to\ndischarge seminal fluid while sleeping.\n\n\n       On cross-examination, the victim's mother confirmed that at the time of the\nincident, the victim had a history of wetting the bed and that cleaning her up would\ngenerally require wiping between her legs and in her vaginal area. She also confirmed\nthat Kellner would sometimes clean the victim and the victim would sometimes sleep in\ntheir bed or want to be close to them. Although she testified that the next morning\nKellner told her that he had taken the victim to bed, she confirmed that Kellner did not\nreport changing the victim the night of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The mother's friend also testified about the victim's disclosure and that the victim\n\"came up to her mom and I, and told us that [Kellner] had touched her.\" After being\nasked, the victim said she was sure about what happened and then demonstrated that\nKellner touched her on her butt. The friend estimated that about an hour passed between\nthe victim's initial disclosure and getting to the police substation.\n\n\n       A detective interviewed the victim at the CAC at about 10:00 p.m. on February 22,\n2019, and a video of the Exploited and Missing Child Unit (EMCU) interview of the\nvictim was admitted at trial. During the EMCU interview, the detective stated that the\nvictim disclosed that two incidents occurred\u2014one after Christmas 2018 and one the night\nbefore the interview. During cross-examination, the detective confirmed that during the\ninitial victim interview she described that Kellner was standing during the incident but\ntestified at trial that he was laying down behind her. The detective also confirmed that a\nfew days after the interview, he spoke to the victim again and she told him that she had a\nwreck on her bicycle and had been scratched by a cat.\n\n\n       The detective also interviewed Kellner late in the evening of February 22, 2019,\nand confirmed that Kellner was able to answer the initial personal information questions,\nappeared to understand the questions, and gave appropriate responses. At trial the\ndetective recounted what Kellner said during the interrogation. The detective testified that\nKellner said \"he woke up around 3:00 in the morning. Went upstairs. Found [the victim]\nasleep on the couch . . . So he carried her back downstairs and placed her in bed.\" The\ndetective stated that during the interrogation, Kellner was very talkative about things\nirrelevant to the case but that he did not seem overly nervous. Kellner stated that he\npulled down the victim's pants and was \"rubbing his penis in between her legs.\" After that\ndisclosure, the detective testified that Kellner explained that when he was carrying the\nvictim, she told him that she loved him and \"that that's what set things in motion.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       During the interrogation Kellner explained that he accessed a video on his phone\nfrom the internet that he characterized as a Japanese video with a young-looking girl\nwhose father character in the video did something similar to the girl. The detective\nconfirmed that Kellner was describing placing his penis between the victim's legs. After\nobtaining a search warrant for Kellner's phone, the detective was able to view the video\nKellner described.\n\n\n       The detective confirmed that Kellner was not permitted to speak to his wife or\nother family during the interrogation. The detective also confirmed that during the\ninterrogation he was not wearing a firearm and was wearing a badge that was likely\ncovered by his jacket. However, the detective denied that Kellner was handcuffed and\nstated that Kellner \"could have asked to leave\" but confirmed that Kellner was placed in a\nlocked interrogation room with no windows and no phone and would have needed\nassistance to leave. The detective testified that Kellner likely sat in the interrogation room\nprior to the interrogation for about an hour and 15 minutes. The detective confirmed that\nhe continued to question Kellner despite knowing that he had a cold, had little sleep, and\nwas tired.\n\n\nThe Video and Forensic Data\n\n\n       A digital forensic examiner with the Wichita Police Department EMCU, Internet\nCrimes Against Children Task Force, testified that she examined Kellner's cell phone and\ncreated a report. She found the video described by Kellner as the Japanese video in the\nphone's deleted area \u2014 meaning it had previously been stored on the phone. The digital\nforensic examiner confirmed that in searching Kellner's cell phone she identified that he\nhad searched for pornography at 4:00 a.m. on the date of the alleged incident. The report\nshowing Kellner's relevant internet searches were admitted at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       A KBI forensic scientist testified that she received a synopsis of the allegations\nand the victim's sexual assault kit. She explained that after swabbing the victim's labia\nmajora and buttocks, she conducted two different tests for seminal fluid on the swabs.\nThe first chemical indicator test was negative for the presence of seminal fluid, but when\nshe viewed the swabs through a microscope she saw sperm, indicating the presence of\nseminal fluid. She then conducted a DNA profile analysis of the seminal fluid on the\nswab which revealed that the DNA profile from the seminal fluid was consistent with\nKellner's DNA profile. The forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-\nejaculation or ejaculation and that there \"needs to be some sort of stimulation and release\nin order for seminal fluid to be present.\" She confirmed that seminal fluid could be\nproduced during a \"wet dream\" and leak through clothing onto other items and confirmed\nthat DNA can be transferred by contact such as if a person picks up another.\n\n\n       A former crime scene investigator with the Wichita Police Department testified\nthat during the search of Kellner's home they used an alternative light source to identify\nfluids such as urine, semen, and sweat stains on the victim's bedsheets. However, stains\nidentified on the bedsheets did not indicate the presence of seminal fluid. So, there was\nno semen found on the victim's bedsheets.\n\n\n       The jury found Kellner guilty of one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a\nchild, and the State dismissed the second count. Kellner, through his attorney, moved for\ndispositional and durational departure. After a hearing on the motion, the district court\ndenied Kellner's motion and he was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25\nyears. Kellner appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Kellner appeals his conviction alleging the following errors: (1) the district court\nerred in admitting his statements made during interrogation; (2) the district court erred in\nfinding he waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16\nL. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) ; (3) the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss\nfor constitutional speedy trial violations; (4) there was insufficient evidence to show he\ntouched the victim with the required statutory intent; (5) the district court erred by\nomitting an essential element of the aggravated indecent liberties with a child jury\ninstruction; (6) the prosecutor erred in closing argument; (7) cumulative error denied him\na fair trial; and (8) the district court erred in denying his motion for durational and\ndispositional departure in sentencing. This court will address each allegation in turn.\n\n\nI. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING KELLNER VOLUNTARILY MADE THE\nINCULPATORY STATEMENTS DURING INTERROGATION\n\n\n\n       Kellner claims that his statements during interrogation were involuntary, and as\nsuch, the statements should not be admitted during trial. After a Jackson v. Denno\nhearing, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964), requested by the State,\nthe district court found Kellner's statements were freely, voluntarily, and knowingly made\nand thus admissible. This court reviews the district court's ruling after a hearing on the\nadmissibility of the victim's statements to police using a bifurcated standard by reviewing\n\"the factual underpinnings of the decision under a substantial competent evidence\nstandard and reviews the ultimate legal conclusion drawn from those facts de novo.\"\nState v. Lowery, 308 Kan. 1183, 1218, 427 P.3d 865 (2018) (quoting State v. Harris, 279\nKan. 163, 167, 105 P.3d 1258 [2005]). Substantial competent evidence is \"legal and\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as being sufficient to support a\nconclusion.\" State v. Walker, 283 Kan. 587, 595, 153 P.3d 1257 (2007). This court \"does\n\n\n                                               7\n\fnot reweigh evidence or assess the credibility of the witnesses but will give deference to\nthe trial court's findings of fact.\" Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1218.\n\n\n       The State has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\nKellner's statements were voluntarily made, that they were the product of his free and\nindependent will. See State v. Mattox, 305 Kan. 1015, 1042, 390 P.3d 514 (2017). This\ncourt considers the totality of the circumstances surrounding Kellner's confession to\ndetermine voluntariness. Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1218-19. The nonexclusive list of factors to\nconsider include: (1) the accused's mental condition; (2) the manner and duration of the\ninterrogation; (3) the ability of the accused to communicate on request with the outside\nworld; (4) the accused's age, intellect, and background; (5) the fairness of the officers in\nconducting the interrogation; and (6) the accused's fluency with the English language.\nState v. Parker, 311 Kan. 255, 259, 459 P.3d 793 (2020) (citing State v. Davis, 306 Kan.\n400, 417, 394 P.3d 817 [2017]); see also State v. Garcia, 297 Kan. 182, 188, 301 P.3d\n658 (2013) (\"These factors, even if established as true, do not necessarily conclusively\nestablish that the confession was involuntary.\").\n\n\n       \"'These factors are not to be weighed against one another with those favorable to a free\n       and voluntary confession offsetting those tending to the contrary. Instead, the situation\n       surrounding the giving of a confession may dissipate the import of an individual factor\n       that might otherwise have a coercive effect. Even after analyzing such dilution, if any, a\n       single factor or a combination of factors considered together may inevitably lead to a\n       conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect's will was overborne and the\n       confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.' [Citation omitted.]\" Mattox, 305\n       Kan. at 1043.\n\n\nAnalysis of this issue requires the court to review the facts surrounding Kellner's\ninculpatory statements during his interrogations. Kellner was taken to the CAC in the\nback of a police car and the detective confirmed that the police car door was probably\nlocked. Once inside the CAC, the detective testified that Kellner was brought directly to\n\n                                                    8\n\fan interview room, which locks the person inside, and the police interrogation started at\nabout 11:00 p.m. The video recording of the interrogation was admitted into evidence and\nshows that prior to questioning, Kellner denied having consumed illegal drugs or alcohol\nwithin the previous 24 hours but said he had taken ibuprofen and Nyquil or Dayquil due\nto a cold. He stated that he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that \"I've\nhad special ed,\" that he had slept the previous night from 8:30 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. and\nconfirmed that he understood the questions being asked. However, when asked, Kellner\ncould not recall his children's birthdays and said, \"My brain is just not, I'm trying to\nfigure out what's going on, trying to process why I'm here and what is going on in my\nworld right now and so my brain isn't where it needs to be.\"\n\n\n       After gathering initial information from Kellner, at approximately 11:20 p.m., the\ndetective notified Kellner they wanted to talk to him about a report that had been made\nand said \"because you're sitting down here in a room at a police station I'm going to go\nover your rights so you're aware of what your rights are . . . and then once we get to that\nif you want to talk to me then we'll get into why we're here, okay.\" The detective gave\nKellner a paper copy of his Miranda rights individually listed and a pen, then read\nthrough each right one at a time and asked Kellner each time whether he understood the\nright. Kellner verbally acknowledged that he understood his rights and initialed each line.\nThe detective also explained that \"you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and\nnot answer any questions or make any statements\" and Kellner said he understood that\nright. The detective then asked Kellner if he wanted to talk. Kellner paused for several\nseconds and responded, \"I'd just like to know what's going on.\" He then paused again for\nabout 20 seconds and eventually said \"Yeah.\" Kellner signed and dated the Miranda\nform, demonstrating he was willing to talk to the police at that time.\n\n\n       Before any questioning, Kellner knew that he was at the police station related to a\nreport from his wife. The detective had explained that \"a lot of times reports are made\nand, you know, we get a small piece of the puzzle \u2026 we won't know the full story until\n\n                                              9\n\fwe talk to you about it.\" Kellner later said \"I wish my wife would just talk to me. She just\nleaves and goes [to] Walmart and calls the cops on her husband.\" The detective then said,\n\" you know obviously a report was made tonight, um, saying some things had happened,\nyou know, earlier today or last night . . . .\"\n\n\n       Throughout the interview, Kellner talked about his home life, work schedule, the\nhome layout, where his kids sleep in the home, and how he feels like his life just consists\nof work and sleep and that he and his wife had been arguing. Kellner offered random\ninformation about his life\u2014chaos with the kids, lack of money, and accused his wife of\n\"planting things into [the kids'] heads.\" Eventually, the detective asked Kellner if he was\nhaving a hard time communicating, and Kellner responded \"Oh, I'm ADHD so I\nmean. . . . My mind breaks down into like a thousand different things.\" The detective\ntried to redirect Kellner to the victim's allegations, but Kellner was reluctant to talk about\nthe allegations.\n\n\nKellner's Inculpatory Statements\n\n\n       The detective suggested that perhaps Kellner put the victim in her bed and his\n\"mind slipped to a place it shouldn't have been for a minute\" and that the victim described\nit in a way to indicate that Kellner \"realized what's going on isn't right and it stopped.\" In\nresponse, Kellner said, \"That's all I could think about at work today,\" and the detective\nasked if Kellner was referring to \"what happened last night.\" Kellner then asked, \"Have\nyou ever had those moments where you just wish you could beat yourself up?\" Kellner\nexplained that he was \"scared\" because the detective had \"the power to essentially ruin\nmy life,\" and said that the detective had \"the power to take something that's not in family\nhistory, it's not, it's not in my upbringing.\" When the detective again asked what\nhappened with the victim, Kellner stated that his wife watches crime shows so he has\n\"seen how all this ends,\" that he would not be allowed to leave, and \"if I keep going\nforward that's exactly where I'm going to end.\"\n\n                                                 10\n\f       When the detective asked if Kellner laid down in the bed with the victim after he\nbrought her downstairs Kellner replied, \"Well I'm beat, I'm tired.\" The detective said,\n\"You're not saying no.\" Kellner then stated that he was tired and \"running on hardly any\nsleep.\" He then said, \"But I did not have a relationship with [the victim],\" to which the\ndetective said that the victim was not describing that but was \"describing something very\nclose to that.\" That is when Kellner said, \"I may have rubbed up against her\" with a \"hard\non.\"\n\n\n       After Kellner confirmed that he had an erection while lying next to the victim, the\ndetective asked a series of questions about how Kellner's penis became exposed during\nthat time. Kellner then said, \"I did make a mistake,\" \"It's crazy, one hour of my life,\" and\n\"It's not even one hour it's more like thirty minutes of my life.\" Kellner denied ejaculating\nwhile with the victim and explained that he went back to his room and ejaculated\n\"[b]ecause who I really wanted to be with was my wife.\" The detective asked what part of\nthe victim touched Kellner's penis and he said, \"Between her legs man.\" Kellner\neventually explained that the victim said she loved him, and \"[m]aybe what turned me on\nis the fact that [the victim] actually loved me.\" He had previously stated that \"[i]t was\nbeing close to her and just knowing that somebody loved you.\" Kellner said, \"the fact that\nit feels like somebody else obviously loves you or shows affection to you that your wife\nis not showing you.\" Kellner stated twice that \"I gave the wrong affection to the wrong\nperson,\" and that \"it wasn't planned\" and \"it was a mistake.\" He explained that his actions\nmimicked \"something I saw on the video\" showing a Japanese father with his daughter.\n\n\n       At approximately 1:40 a.m., the detective left and Kellner was given a smoke\nbreak. As the detective was leaving the room, Kellner said, \"My life is going to be ruined\nby one mistake,\" to which the detective replied, \"That isn't up to me.\" The detective\nreturned at 2:22 a.m. and asked if Kellner would consent to a search of his phone. Kellner\nexpressed concern that he had made a bad choice, and that he did not \"have legal\nrepresentation here, I don't know nothing about any of this process\" and that \"I can tell\n\n                                             11\n\fyou now it never ends well.\" The detective repeatedly asked Kellner to make a decision\nabout the phone, and told Kellner he could refuse. Kellner never responded so the\ndetective took his refusal to respond to be a no, and concluded the interview. When\nKellner asked the detective what he was supposed to do, the detective responded, \"That's\nnot an answer I can give you.\" The detective eventually notified Kellner he would be\ngoing to jail, and the evidence would be submitted to the district attorney's office. The\ninterview concluded at approximately 2:30 a.m.\n\n\nThe State's Jackson v. Denno Hearing\n\n\n       At the State's request and before the trial began, the district court held a hearing to\ndetermine whether Kellner's interview statements were voluntarily made under the\ntotality of the circumstances. The district court found that Kellner's mental state\nsupported a finding of voluntariness because Kellner was able to understand and respond\nto the detective's questions appropriately and did not appear to be under the influence,\nthough he was tired and veered off topic several times. Regarding the manner and\nduration of the interview, the court noted that Kellner was not under arrest or handcuffed,\nhe was given water and a smoke break, he was offered food, and the interview was not\nparticularly lengthy, which supported a finding of voluntariness. However, the interview\nwas late at night, Kellner was tired, he was driven to the CAC in a police car, was\nescorted inside by an officer, and was then locked inside an interrogation room. The court\nexplained that the detective acted fairly in conducting the interrogation, weighing in favor\nof voluntariness, as evidenced by the lack of threats or promises used, that the detective\ndid not raise his voice and accommodated Kellner's tendency to go off topic. The court\nfound Kellner's age and intellect also indicated voluntariness, though it did not describe\nits reasoning. The audio recording of the interrogation was admitted as evidence at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fKellner's Mental State\n\n\n       Kellner claims that his mental state weighs in favor of finding his statements\ninvoluntary because his ADHD, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, anxiety, and tiredness\nduring the interview made it difficult for him to understand and communicate. He also\nalleges that the detective implied that it would be in Kellner's best interest to confess, and\nthat a competency evaluation showed that Kellner needed things explained to him slowly.\nThe video and transcript of Kellner's interview clearly demonstrate that he had difficulty\nstaying focused, staying on topic, and appropriately responding to prompts from the\ndetective. Though Kellner's lack of focus could relate to his ADHD or other mental\nconditions, it could also be viewed as his desire to evade the topic. He verbalized his\nthoughts, answered direct questions, said he was worried about the consequences of his\nstatements, and clearly understood the questions and reason they were being asked. Much\nof Kellner's off-topic discussion includes shifting blame to his wife and lengthy\nexplanations or excuses for his behavior\u2014demonstrating that Kellner understood the\ndetective's questions and why he was being interviewed. Kellner also made several\nstatements demonstrating that he understood the detective was attempting to get Kellner\nto inculpate himself and that disclosure could lead to Kellner facing legal consequences.\nAlthough it is likely that Kellner was tired, he did not request to cease questioning but in\nfact continued talking and offering information for the entire interview. There is\nsubstantial competent evidence supporting the district court's determination that Kellner's\nmental state did not render his statements involuntary. See Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1222-23\n(declining to reweigh the evidence where the court found he was \"'responsive'\" to\nquestioning and not impaired by a lack of sleep or possible head injury).\n\n\nThe Manner and Duration of the Interview\n\n\n       Kellner was unrestrained during the interrogation, had access to water, was given a\nbreak to smoke, and the interrogation was relatively short, lasting less than three and a\n\n                                             13\n\fhalf hours including breaks. Additionally, the interviewing detective remained calm\nthroughout: he did not raise his voice, did not act physically imposing, did not threaten\nKellner, and did not engage in deception. Moreover, Kellner began making statements\nindicating knowledge of wrongdoing within an hour and a half. Although the interview\noccurred late at night and into the early morning hours, the totality of the interview\ndemonstrates that the late hour did not impact the manner of the interview in such a way\nas to make Kellner's statements involuntary. See e.g., Mattox, 305 Kan. at 1045 (finding\nstatements voluntary when the interviewer remained calm, the interrogation was about\nthree hours long, and the defendant began confessing shortly after the start of the\ninterrogation).\n\n\n       Kellner claims that he was denied requests to communicate with the outside world,\nspecifically that he was denied the ability to speak to his wife, who was his primary\nsupport, which made his statements involuntary. \"While isolation from the outside world\ncan be a factor in making an interrogation coercive, it is to be expected that police will\ntake steps to limit the ability of potential witnesses and suspects to communicate and,\npotentially, conspire during an investigation.\" Walker, 283 Kan. at 598. Additionally,\ndenial of a request to contact the outside world is not coercive where the defendant's\nrequest \"suggest[ed] his motivation for seeking outside contact was to gather information\nand, in turn, explains the police officers' reluctance to grant his request.\" 283 Kan. at 598.\nKellner knew that his wife called the police, and Kellner indicated that is why he wanted\nto talk to her. Kellner wanted information from his wife about the investigation and\nallegations, and the detectives very reasonably denied his request to speak to her. See 283\nKan. at 598.\n\n\nKellner's Age, Intellect, and Background\n\n\n       On appeal, Kellner argues that his age, intellect, and background do not support a\nfinding that his statements were voluntary under the circumstances. Although Kellner\n\n                                             14\n\fcompleted high school, took some technical classes at a community college, and\nmaintained employment, he claims that he also took special education courses\n\"throughout his life.\" Although Kellner had ADHD and some special education courses, a\nsocial worker who assessed his competency to stand trial found him of average intellect.\nAt the time of interrogation, he was 34 years old, had attended \"some college,\" worked as\na diesel tech and had an employment history. Moreover, during the interrogation, Kellner\nappeared to understand why he was there and why he was being asked the questions, and\nthe interrogators did not deceive him about the available evidence. Substantial competent\nevidence supports the district court's finding that, under the totality of the circumstances,\nKellner's age, intellect, and background demonstrate he made voluntary statements to\npolice officers.\n\n\nFairness of Interrogation Techniques\n\n\n       Kellner next argues the detective acted unfairly in conducting the interrogation by\ntelling Kellner the outcome would be better for him if he told the truth. He refers to the\ndetective's statement that \"'when it's all said and done I can say you know what, Tim\nmade a mistake but he owned up to it,'\" and that \"'if we can talk about why that happened\nand if it's just a, a lapse in judgment that something happened for a moment that should\nnot have happened, let's talk about that.'\" Unlike other cases where interrogators have\npromised or threatened outcomes related to the interrogee's statements\u2014here, the\ndetective did not cross that line. The detective's statements are general advice about how\nKellner's actions and willingness to be truthful could be viewed by the detective. \"'[M]ere\nadvice or admonition to the defendant to speak the truth, which does not import either a\nthreat or benefit, will not make a following confession incompetent.'\" State v. Farmer,\n285 Kan. 541, 554, 175 P.3d 221 (2008) (quoting State v. Kornstett, 62 Kan. 221, 227, 61\nP. 805 [1900], wherein a police officer told a defendant he would feel better if he told the\ntruth). The detective did not threaten worse treatment or promise benefits related to\nKellner talking.\n\n                                             15\n\f       Moreover, the detective explicitly said he could not make Kellner any guarantees\nor promises about the outcome, and Kellner acknowledged he understood. Kellner said\nthat his fear of repercussions was keeping him from talking freely and said, \"The only\nway I can talk about it then is if you tell me what they're going to do to me.\" The\ndetective replied that \"when I'm done talking to you I'm going to talk to my supervisor\nand a decision is going to be made.\" When Kellner expressed concern about what would\nbe done to him, the detective responded by saying, \"I'm not going to do anything to you.\nOkay. But we need to talk about this.\" Lastly, Kellner stated, \"I don't know what's going\nto happen to me man,\" and the detective replied that he didn't know what was going to\nhappen to Kellner but that he had seen cases go \"all which ways.\" The detective avoided\npromising Kellner leniency or a change in circumstance that could result from Kellner's\nstatements, which does not tend to show coercion. See State v. Swanigan, 279 Kan. 18,\n39, 106 P.3d 39 (2005) (finding threats of specific charges or increased penalty under the\nother circumstances of the interrogation showed the statements were not voluntary).\n\n\n       Kellner also claims that the detective's faux empathy and claims of helping\neffectively diluted the Miranda warning by decreasing Kellner's understanding that the\ndetective was an adversary. However, Kellner's own statements during the interrogation\nundermine his assertion on appeal. Kellner told the detective \"I know exactly what your\njob is,\" and that he had seen crime shows and knows \"exactly how this works.\" Kellner\nalso said that that he understood \"[y]ou're not going to let me walk out of this place.\" He\nalso expressed that talking to the detective could \"essentially ruin my life.\" Nothing about\nKellner's actions during the interrogation, his age, experience, or relationship with the\ninterrogating officer demonstrated that he believed the detective was acting as anything\nother than a legal authority investigating a report of wrongdoing.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances, including the manner and duration of the\ninterrogation, Kellner's intellect and age, his inability to communicate with his wife, and\nthe fairness of the interrogation techniques, demonstrate that Kellner's will was not\n\n                                             16\n\foverborne and that his statements were freely and voluntarily made. See Mattox, 305\nKan. at 1042-43. The district court did not err in admitting Kellner's statements at trial.\n\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING KELLNER WAIVED HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently\u2014\neither expressly or implicitly\u2014waive his right to remain silent during the interrogation.\n\n\n       The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords individuals the\nright to not be compelled to incriminate themselves. See e.g. Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU.S. at 439. This privilege provides that \"statements stemming from custodial\ninterrogation must be excluded unless the State demonstrates it used procedural\nsafeguards, i.e., Miranda warnings, to secure the defendant's privilege against self-\nincrimination.\" State v. Regelman, 309 Kan. 52, 59, 430 P.3d 946 (2018). However, once\nalerted to their rights, a suspect may waive those rights and inculpate themselves. \"If a\ndefendant voluntarily waives Miranda rights, any subsequent inculpatory statement must\nstill be voluntarily given.\" Khalil-Alsalaami v. State, 313 Kan. 472, 500, 486 P.3d 1216\n(2021). This waiver may be explicit or implicit.\n\n\n       A suspect may waive their Miranda privileges, either explicitly or implicitly, and\nlaw enforcement is not required to follow a specific, step-by-step procedure to obtain\nsuch waiver. State v. Parker, 311 Kan. 255, 258-59 (2020) (discussing methods and\nrequirements for obtaining waiver of Miranda privileges); State v. Kirtdoll, 281 Kan.\n1138, 1144, 136 P.3d 417 (2006) (finding Miranda waiver may be implicit or explicit).\nThis court reviews de novo whether a defendant voluntarily waived Miranda rights under\na totality of the circumstances. Kirtdoll, 281 Kan. at 1144. Typically, whether a\ndefendant's statements to law enforcement were voluntarily made\u2014as discussed above\u2014\nis a separate determination from whether the defendant waived their Miranda rights.\nKhalil-Alsalaami, 313 Kan. at 500; see also Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483. However, when as\n\n                                             17\n\fhere the waiver is arguably implicit, \"the issue of whether the defendant waived his or her\nMiranda rights can be virtually indistinguishable from the issue of whether the\ndefendant's statement was voluntary.\" Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Kellner knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently waived\u2014whether explicitly or implicitly\u2014his right to\nremain silent. The detective told Kellner that he wanted to talk to Kellner about a report\nthat was made to learn the whole story. He explained that because Kellner was sitting in a\npolice station, he wanted to go over Kellner's rights so that Kellner was \"aware of what\n[his] rights are.\" He then read through each right, asked Kellner if he understood them,\nand asked Kellner to initial if he understood the rights. This list of rights included\nKellner's right to decide at any time to invoke his right to remain silent and not answer\nany questions or make any statements, his right to speak to a lawyer, or have a lawyer\nappointed\u2014all of which Kellner acknowledged. Kellner verbally answered that he\nunderstood each right. The detective then asked, \"[H]aving these rights in mind do you\nwish to talk to me now?\" After a short pause, and expressing his desire to speak to his\nwife, Kellner eventually said, \"[Y]eah\" and signed and dated the form that he agreed to\nwaive his rights. There can be few more explicit acts to demonstrate waiver. Kellner did\nnot say he was confused about his rights, did not ask questions about the Miranda rights\nwhen they were explained, and never expressed his desire to exercise them at any time\nlater in the interrogation.\n\n\n       Although the detective did not fully explain the underlying reason for\nadministering Kellner's Miranda rights or the possible consequences of the interrogation,\nthis lack of disclosure was not deceptive and was not required. This court has reviewed\nmany interrogations where officers openly explained that the Miranda rights were being\nprovided because the accused was facing possible criminal charges, and still the accused\nvoluntarily waived their rights and made inculpatory statements. Although that scenario\nis preferred, officers are not required to rise to that level of disclosure. See e.g., Parker,\n\n                                               18\n\f311 Kan. at 258-59 (finding that officers met the minimum requirements by giving the\naccused a written copy of his Miranda rights and reading the rights aloud even though\nthey did not ask if he understood the rights). While the reason for giving Kellner his\nMiranda rights could have been more thorough, the detective did tell Kellner that the\npolice received a report, and the detective wanted to ask him questions related to that\nreport. Kellner also knew that his wife had called the police and that\u2014as he expressed\nduring the interrogation\u2014police investigate crimes and talking to them could have\nsignificant consequences. The detective did not deceive Kellner about the reason for the\ndetective's questions or the reason for the Miranda rights.\n\n\n       The detective read Kellner each Miranda right, asked if he understood them,\nallowed Kellner to initial his understanding, and then asked Kellner if he wished to waive\nthe rights and talk to the detective. Under the totality of these circumstances, Kellner\nexpressly and knowingly waived his Miranda rights and voluntarily talked to the\ndetective. Even if Kellner's waiver were insufficient to be explicit, his actions also\ndemonstrate an implicit waiver. When, as here, there is no evidence of coercion, a\ndefendant can implicitly waive their right to remain silent by confirming they understand\ntheir rights and engaging in conduct that demonstrates waiver, such as talking. Kirtdoll,\n281 Kan. at 1146.\n\n\n       The district court did not err in finding Kellner waived his right to remain silent\nduring the interrogation.\n\n\nIII. THE STATE DID NOT VIOLATE KELLNER'S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial\nbecause his case was pending for two years and ten months before the trial. The Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\u2014which is applicable to the states through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2014provides that \"the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n\n                                             19\n\fand public trial.\" State v. Owens, 310 Kan. 865, 869, 451 P.3d 467 (2019); Klopfer v.\nState of N.C., 386 U.S. 213, 222-23, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967). Unlike\nKansas's statutory right to speedy trial under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-3402, which provides\na specific number of days within which to bring a defendant to trial, the constitutional\nspeedy trial right does not create a strict timeframe. Rather, whether a trial is speedy\ndepends on the circumstances of each case. State v. Ford, 316 Kan. 558, 560, 519 P.3d\n456, 458 (2022).\n\n\n       This court exercises an unlimited review of Kellner's constitutional speedy trial\nclaim and considers the length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion\nof his right, and any resulting prejudice to the defendant to determine whether the State\nviolated a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S.\n514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972); State v. Shockley, 314 Kan. 46, 62,\n494 P.3d 832 (2021). These factors are considered and weighed against one another, and\nno one factor is controlling. State v. Weaver, 276 Kan. 504, 506, 78 P.3d 397 (2003).\n\n\nLength of Delay\n\n\n       \"'The constitutional protection of a speedy trial attaches when one becomes\naccused and the criminal prosecution begins, usually by either an indictment, an\ninformation, or an arrest, whichever first occurs.'\" Ford, 316 Kan. at 561 (quoting State v.\nRivera, 277 Kan. 109, 112, 83 P.3d 169 [2004]). Only if the delay is presumptively\nprejudicial does this court need to inquire further into the analysis. Weaver, 276 Kan. at\n506. Kellner was charged on February 27, 2019, and his trial began on January 18,\n2022\u2014a delay of two years and nearly eleven months.\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       The United States Supreme Court and Kansas Supreme Court have both found that\ndelays of more than three years triggered examination of the other three factors. See\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 533 (delay of five years); State v. Dolack, 216 Kan. 622,\n636, 533 P.2d 1282 (1975) (delay of over three years); State v. Hemminger, 210 Kan.\n587, 594, 502 P.2d 791 (1972) (delay of over four years). Assuming this almost three-\nyear delay is presumptively prejudicial, as did the district court, this court considers the\nother factors to determine if Kellner's constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.\n\n\nReason for Delay\n\n\n       Kellner acknowledges that his trial date was repeatedly delayed to accommodate\nhis three counsel changes, allow a competency evaluation, and due to the COVID-19\npandemic which halted trials for several months. The State did not request any\ncontinuances of the trial date. Kellner argues this factor should not weigh against him\nbecause the delays were due to \"more neutral reason[s].\" Although Kellner classifies his\nrequested continuances for trial preparation and a competency evaluation as \"neutral,\"\nthis court disagrees. See Rivera, 277 Kan. at 117 (where the court found defendant's\nrequests for continuance to prepare attributable to the defendant).\n\n\n       Here, only one delay is attributable to the State\u2014the time between the October\n2019 preliminary hearing and November 2019 jury trial control date. The rest of the\ncontinuances were attributable to Kellner to allow him to seek new counsel, allow his\nnew counsel time to prepare, and to allow his counsel to seek a competency evaluation of\nhim. As a result, this factor weights against Kellner.\n\n\nKellner's Assertion of the Right to Speedy Trial\n\n\n       Although it is the State's obligation to timely bring a defendant to trial, the court\ncan weigh a defendant's efforts to assert their right to a speedy trial. \"'[F]ailure to assert\n\n                                               21\n\fthe right will make it difficult for the defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy\ntrial.'\" Rivera, 277 Kan. at 117. Kellner first asserted his right to a speedy trial by filing a\npro se motion on November 24, 2021\u2014roughly two years and nine months after the State\nbrought charges against him. His attorney then filed a motion asserting his right to speedy\ntrial on January 8, 2022\u2014shortly before the scheduled trial.\n\n\n          Kellner waited until shortly before trial to assert his right, when little more could\nbe done to speed up the process, and only after repeatedly causing and requesting\ncontinuances of the trial date. This factor does not weigh against the State.\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner\n\n\n          Ultimately, the most important factor in this analysis is whether and to what\nextent, if any, Kellner was prejudiced by the delay. In analyzing whether the defendant\nsuffered prejudice, this court determines whether the defendant suffered (1) oppressive\npretrial incarceration, (2) constitutionally cognizable anxiety, (3) or impairment to the\nability to present a defense. Harris v. Champion, 15 F.3d 1538, 1559 (10th Cir. 1994).\nThe most important of these factors is the last because \"the inability of a defendant\nadequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\" Weaver, 276 Kan.\nat 511.\n\n\n          Kellner argues that his liberty was significantly restrained pre-trial for almost three\nyears which also caused him anxiety. Even assuming that the almost three-year pretrial\nincarceration was oppressive, there is no evidence that Kellner suffered particularized\nanxiety violative of his constitutional rights. A defendant asserting a cognizable claim for\nprejudice stemming from anxiety associated with prolonged pretrial incarceration must\nmake a \"'particularized and substantial showing of anxiety distinguishable from anxiety\nsuffered by other similarly situated defendants.'\" State v. Hurst, 62 Kan. App. 2d 614,\n623, 521 P.3d 1 (2022) (quoting State v. Bussart-Savaloja, 40 Kan. App. 2d 916, 925,\n\n                                                22\n\f198 P.3d 163 [2008]). Kellner asserts no allegations of particularized anxiety associated\nwith his pretrial incarceration.\n\n\n       Kellner lastly argues that the delay impacted his ability to assert a defense. Kellner\nclaims that the following line of trial testimony where the victim was unable to remember\ncertain details resulted from the trial delay and affected his ability to cross examine her:\n\n\n       \"Q.    Okay. And your testimony was that it was like with his arm or his hand?\n       \"A.    Yes.\n       \"Q.    Okay. Do you know if there was like a towel or some sort of clothing or\n       something that maybe was in his hands?\n       \"A.    No.\n       \"Q.    You don't know, or you - -\n       \"A.    I don't know.\n       \"Q.    Pardon me?\n       \"A.    I don't really know.\n       ...\n       \"Q.    Okay. Also, do you remember back in that timeframe liking to sleep with your\n       mom?\n       \"A.    Sometimes.\n       \"Q.    And liking to sleep with your dad sometimes?\n       \"A.    I don't remember that.\n       \"Q.    Okay. How about sleeping with your sister?\n       \"A.    Yes, I remember that.\"\n\n\n       While the victim testified that she did not recall facts related to a couple of\nquestions, such responses are not abnormal nor are they necessarily attributable to the\ndelay in trial. The victim was young\u2014under age seven\u2014at the time of the incident and\nstill young at the time of trial which makes it understandable that she may not recall\ndetails from her childhood. Moreover, Kellner fails to show how the victim's memory\nlapses as to these facts impeded his defense. The victim's memory as to these facts is not\n\n\n                                                23\n\fexculpatory, and if she had recalled in the negative as to either question, her testimony\ncould have been worse for the defendant. This court cannot guess or assume how Kellner\nbelieves the victim's inability to recall in the cited circumstances hurt his ability to form a\ndefense. Nor has he shown that the victim at such a young age would have recalled more\nas to these questions in a manner that would have helped his case had the trial proceeded\nearlier.\n\n\n       Here, the prejudice factors weigh heavily in favor of the State. Although the delay\nin the trial date was presumptively prejudicial, Kellner ultimately did not suffer any\nprejudice from that delay that violated his constitutional rights. Kellner caused, created,\nor requested most of the delays, he failed to assert his right to speedy trial until shortly\nbefore trial, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay.\n\n\nIV.    THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT KELLNER TOUCHED THE MINOR VICTIM\nWITH THE INTENT TO AROUSE OR SATISFY SEXUAL DESIRES\n\n\n\n       Kellner claims the State failed to prove that his lewd touching of the victim was\n\"done with\" the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires, and thus the State failed to\nprove he violated the aggravated indecent liberties with a child statute. The aggravated\nindecent liberties with a child statute under which Kellner was convicted provides that:\n\n\n       \"(b) Aggravated indecent liberties with a child is:\n       \". . .\n       \"(3) engaging in any of the following acts with a child who is under 14 years of age:\n       \"(A) Any lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the offender, done\n       or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of either the child\n       or the offender, or both.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A).\n\n\nKellner argues that \"[a] person might engage in lewd touching for other reasons or for no\nreason and might separately have an intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\" He claims,\n                                                    24\n\f\"The record is devoid of any evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that any\ntouching in this case was done with the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\" He\ndoes not claim that he was not sexually aroused, but claims the lewd touching was not\nwhat caused his arousal but that he was aroused because the victim said she loved him,\nand then he satisfied his sexual desire away from the victim.\n\n\n       This court reviews a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by reviewing the\nevidence in the most favorable light to the State \"to determine whether a rational\nfactfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\" without\nreweighing the credibility of the evidence. State v. Aguirre, 313 Kan. 189, 209, 485 P.3d\n576 (2021). This is a high burden, and this court will not reverse a guilty verdict without\nfinding the evidence \"so incredible that no reasonable fact-finder could find guilt beyond\na reasonable doubt.\" State v. Meggerson, 312 Kan. 238, 247, 474 P.3d 761 (2020).\n\n\n       Kellner fails to present evidence to meet this high burden. Although Kellner did\nnot admit his intent in touching the victim, that is not required. \"Intent is usually proven\nby inference arising from circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of a\ndefendant's state of mind is rarely available.\" State v. Gonzalez, 311 Kan. 281, 288, 460\nP.3d 348 (2020). Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support even the most serious\nconviction even when it does not exclude every other possible conclusion. State v.\nColson, 312 Kan. 739, 750, 480 P.3d 167 (2021); State v. Pattillo, 311 Kan. 995, 1003,\n469 P.3d 1250 (2020).\n\n\n       Kellner told the detective that \"[m]aybe what turned me on is the fact that [the\nvictim] actually loved me\" and told him \"I love you . . . .\" Kellner told the detective that\nwhile he was putting his penis between the victim's legs (like what he saw in the video he\nwatched on his phone) \"who I really wanted to be with was my wife. I wanted to be close\nto my wife.\" The evidence presented at trial was that seminal fluid consistent with\nKellner's DNA profile was found on the victim's labia and the KBI forensic scientist\n\n                                             25\n\ftestified that there \"needs to be some sort of stimulation and release in order for seminal\nfluid to be present.\" In closing, Kellner's counsel argued that the victim's description was\nconsistent with Kellner cleaning her after she wet the bed, that the detective\nacknowledged to Kellner that he did not believe Kellner's actions were intentional, and\nthat Kellner would not have left the victim after getting an erection if he wished to satisfy\nhis sexual desires with her.\n\n\n       The evidence most favorable to the State is sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder\nto infer that Kellner lewdly touched the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire and thus find him guilty of aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nV.     THE JURY INSTRUCTION CONTAINED THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AGGRAVATED\nINDECENT LIBERTIES WITH A CHILD\n\n\n\n       The parties agreed, without objection from Kellner, to use the standard PIK Crim.\n4th 55.121 (2016 Supp.) jury instruction language for the aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child charges. The jury instruction stated:\n\n\n       \"INSTRUCTION 6\n               \"In count one, the defendant is charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a\n       child. The defendant pleads not guilty.\n               \"To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n               \"1. The defendant engaged in lewd fondling or touching of [the victim].\n               \"2. The defendant intended to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the\n       defendant.\n               \"3. At the time of the act, [the victim] was less than 14 years old.\n               \"4. The defendant was 18 or more years old at the time the act occurred.\n               \"5. This act occurred on or between the 21st day of February, 2019 and the 22nd\n       day of February, 2019 in Sedgwick County, Kansas.\n\n\n                                                   26\n\f                \"'Lewd fondling or touching' means fondling or touching in a manner which\n       tends to undermine the morals of a child and is so clearly offensive as to outrage the\n       moral senses of a reasonable person. Lewd fondling or touching does not require contact\n       with the sex organ of one or the other.\n\n\n                \"The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\n       defendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant's desire or conscious objective to do\n       the act complained about by the State.\"\n\n\nThe elements of the instruction and definition of \"lewd fondling or touching\" are\nconsistent with the PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea of\nintent, is consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th 52.010\n(2021 Supp.).\n\n\n       Kellner argues for the first time on appeal that the provided jury instruction failed\nto connect the element of lewd fondling with the element of arousal or sexual desire and\nthus misstated the law. This court evaluates alleged jury instruction errors using a three-\nstep process to determine whether (1) there is appellate jurisdiction; (2) error occurred;\nand (3) any identified errors require reversal. Whether the defendant preserved their\nclaim for appeal at step one impacts any reversibility inquiry at step three. Before\nevaluating reversibility, this court must determine whether the jury instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate applying a de novo standard. State v. Holley, 313 Kan.\n249, 253-54, 485 P.3d 614 (2021).\n\n\nStep One: Kellner Failed to Object to the Jury Instruction at Trial\n\n\n       It is undisputed that Kellner failed to object to the provided jury instruction before\nthe district court. In fact, his attorney stated, \"I think that elements of the offense are\nlisted.\" Kellner's failure to preserve this issue by objecting at trial does not prohibit its\nappellate review but rather changes the review standard. Holley, 313 Kan. at 254. This\n\n                                                   27\n\fcourt reviews the unpreserved claim of jury instruction error for clear error. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 22-3414(3) (\"No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an\ninstruction . . . unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its\nverdict . . . unless the instruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly\nerroneous.\"). A jury instruction is clearly erroneous if it is legally or factually\ninappropriate and the appellate court is firmly convinced the jury would have reached a\ndifferent verdict if the erroneous instruction had not been given. The party claiming clear\nerror has the burden to show both error and prejudice. State v. Crosby, 312 Kan. 630,\n639, 479 P.3d 167 (2021).\n\n\nStep Two: The Provided Jury Instruction Was Legally And Factually Appropriate\n\n\n       This court evaluates jury instruction error by determining if it was legally and\nfactually appropriate. An instruction is legally appropriate if it fairly and accurately states\nthe applicable law. State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, 302, 382 P.3d 373 (2016). The jury\ninstruction is factually appropriate if it is \"supported by the particular facts of the case at\nbar.\" State v. Plummer, 295 Kan. 156, 161, 283 P.3d 202 (2012). In evaluating whether\nan instruction is factually appropriate, courts must determine whether there was sufficient\nfavorable evidence to the defendant to support the instruction. Holley, 313 Kan. at 255.\n\n\n       The jury instructions were taken from and matched the PIK instruction for\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, including the elements and definition of \"lewd\nfondling or touching.\" PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea\nof intent, was consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th\n52.010. As was done in this case, the Kansas Supreme Court \"'strongly recommend[s] the\nuse of PIK instructions, which knowledgeable committees develop to bring accuracy,\nclarity, and uniformity to instructions.'\" State v. Butler, 307 Kan. 831, 847, 416 P.3d 116\n(2018).\n\n\n                                               28\n\f       A \"trial court has the duty to inform the jury of every essential element of the\ncrime that is charged\" by using the language of the statute or other appropriate and\naccurate language. State v. Richardson, 290 Kan. 176, 181, 224 P.3d 553 (2010). The\njury instruction given matched the PIK and the statutory language of the offense, which\nprovides \"[a]ny lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the\noffender, done or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of\neither the child or the offender, or both.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A). The jury\ninstruction given included each essential element of the crime.\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the phrase \"done with\" should be considered an essential\nelement of the crime because it connects Kellner's intent of arousal or satisfying sexual\ndesire to the act of lewd touching. Although perhaps an interesting intellectual exercise,\nthis argument lacks merit in law and fact. The jury instruction contained the essential\nelement of the act followed by the essential element of the intent. A natural reading of the\ninstruction connects the act with the intent. In fact, if Kellner had merely desired to be\nsexually aroused or satisfy sexual desire, but had not lewdly touched the victim then there\nwould not be sufficient evidence to support a conviction for aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child. Additionally, the jury instruction explained that \"[t]he State must prove that\nthe defendant committed the crime intentionally,\" which means the defendant had the\n\"desire or conscious objective to do the act\" which further connected the act of lewd\ntouching to the required intent.\n\n\n       Kellner also argues that the instruction was factually inappropriate because at trial\nhe argued that his erection occurred before he laid the victim down; that he may have\nbumped against her with his erection; and he later got out of her bed to watch\npornography. So, Kellner apparently attempted to assert that he was aroused and/or\nsatisfied his sexual desire both before and after lewdly touching the victim but the arousal\nand/or sexual desire were wholly unrelated to the intervening lewd touching. He argues,\ntherefore, that inclusion of the was \"done with\" language would have been factually\n\n                                             29\n\fappropriate because the jury could have found that his lewd touching of the victim was\nnot \u201cdone with\u201d the requisite intent even though he was simultaneously sexually aroused\nand did contemporaneously satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       Kellner attempts to argue on appeal that the instruction could be read to find a\ndefendant guilty after engaging in lewd fondling or touching while contemporaneously\nintending to arouse or satisfy their sexual desires from unrelated acts. Such a\ncircumstance is difficult to imagine and was not presented in this case. The facts of this\ncase readily and easily connected Kellner's arousal to his lewd touching of the victim\nbecause Kellner admitted the victim's statement to him began his arousal that evening and\nthat he had watched a pornographic video that matched the allegations of his lewd\ntouching. Then, shortly after the lewd touching, he completed the physical release of his\narousal. There are no facts in this case demonstrating that Kellner engaged in lewd\ntouching separate and unrelated to his intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       There are other pattern jury instructions with separate illegal acts and requisite\nintent that use connective language to relate the act and intent. See, e.g., PIK Crim. 4th\n55.090 (2021 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant \"touched\" the victim, and\nthat \"touching was done with the intent\" to arouse or satisfy sexual desires); PIK Crim.\n4th 55.181 (2017 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant possessed a type of\nvisual depiction and \"did so\" with the requisite intent). While adding the \"done with\"\nlanguage would have been both legally and factually appropriate, its omission was not\nfactually or legally inappropriate. The aggravated indecent liberties with a child jury\ninstruction, including definitions, naturally connected the essential elements of the act\nand intent even without the \"done with\" language, which fairly and accurately states the\nlaw and is supported by the case facts. Just because a jury instruction could be better,\nclearer, or more complete does not make it factually or legally inappropriate or\ninaccurate. There was no error.\n\n\n                                             30\n\fStep Three: The Error Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Even assuming an error occurred, Kellner is not entitled to reversal of his\nconviction unless he can show the instruction was clearly erroneous and the jury would\nhave reached a different verdict absent the erroneous instruction. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3414(3) (\"No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction . . .\nunless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict . . . unless the\ninstruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly erroneous.\"); Crosby, 312 Kan.\nat 639. Kellner bears this heightened burden because he failed to object to the jury\ninstruction at trial and thus deprived the district court of an opportunity to avoid the\nalleged error and present the jury with an instruction that more clearly connected the act\nwith the intent.\n\n\n       As explained previously, there was ample evidence that Kellner engaged in lewd\nfondling or touching of the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desires.\nSeminal fluid consistent with Kellner's DNA was found on the victim's labia; Kellner\nadmitted to the detective that he rubbed his penis between the victim's legs imitating a\nvideo he saw and that he regretted the action; Kellner stated that he became aroused by\nthe victim's statement of love which occurred just before he touched her with his penis;\nand the forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-ejaculate or\nejaculate and that \"stimulation and release\" is needed for seminal fluid to be present.\nKellner presented no evidence that he was not intending to be aroused or satisfy sexual\ndesire when he lewdly touched the victim. His only evidence that his arousal or\nsatisfaction of sexual desire was not related to the lewd touching of the victim is that he\nleft the room before completing his masturbatory act, and perhaps that he wished he was\ntouching his wife when touching the victim.\n\n\n       There is no evidence that convinces this court that the jury would have reached a\ndifferent result had the jury instruction more clearly connected the actus reus: Kellner's\n\n                                               31\n\flewd touching of the victim, with the means rea, Kellner's intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire. To be clear, the instruction was not erroneous, and this analysis is provided\nsimply for completeness. But even assuming the provided jury instruction was not legally\nor factually appropriate, it was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nVI.    KELLNER'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Kellner asserts that during closing argument, the prosecutor made several \"we\nknow\" statements, provided his opinion, and misstated the law, cumulatively creating\nreversible error. This court evaluates claims of prosecutorial misconduct in two steps to\ndetermine whether an error occurred and then determining if the identified error\nprejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial. State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 109, 378\nP.3d 1060 (2016). An error occurs when this court finds that \"the prosecutor's comments\nfall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors\" and offends the defendant's rights.\nState v. Alfaro-Valleda, 314 Kan. 526, 538, 502 P.3d 66 (2022). If such an error occurred,\nthis court must then determine if that error prejudiced the defendant. 314 Kan. at 538.\nWhen both constitutional and nonconstitutional prosecutorial errors have occurred, an\nappellate court applies the constitutional harmless standard to determine whether the\nState can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of will not or\ndid not affect the outcome of the trial in light of the entire record. Sherman, 305 Kan. at\n100 (citing State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, Syl \u00b6 6, 256 P.3d 801 [2011]).\n\n\nThe Prosecutor's \"We know\" Statements\n\n\n       First, Kellner argues the prosecutor erred in making the following \"we know\"\nstatements regarding allegedly disputed facts:\n\n\n       1. \"So let's walk through the timeline. We know how the disclosure happened based on\n          the evidence. This is the evidence of what happened. [The victim] goes to sleep. [The\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f           victim] goes to school. When she gets home from school, [the mom's friend] is over\n           there with her mom. And she tells her: 'Daddy touched my butt.'\"\n\n\n       2. \"And what do we also know from the DNA? We know that seminal fluid was found\n           on [the victim]. Now you can debate whether you believe that's pre-ejaculate or\n           ejaculation. The defendant told Detective Ribble he did not ejaculate. Nevertheless,\n           seminal fluid comes from a male, undisputed. It's on [the victim]. That's what the\n           evidence shows. The DNA\u2014this man, the defendant.\"\n\n\n       3. \"And remember, pornography in itself is not the issue here. It's not illegal to view it.\n           Adult pornography, it's not the issue. It's reliving a sexual fantasy with a child that is\n           illegal. That's the focus here. And we know from the sperm found in that seminal\n           fluid what he wanted to accomplish, that he had to go elsewhere to finish.\"\n\n\n       4. \"I will submit to you, the evidence tells you very clearly this wasn't a mistake. This\n           wasn't an accident. He made a decision. He intended to gratify himself sexually. He\n           may not have completed the entire mission, but that's what his intent was when he\n           touched her, and that's what the law requires the State to prove.\n\n           \"How do we know that? How do you know that? Look at his words again, his\n           consciousness. The struggles he goes through in that interview with Detective\n           Ribble.\"\n\n\n       A prosecutor's use of \"we know\" statements in closing argument can lead to error\nwhen those statements are used \"in the context of making inferences for the jury because\nthat use convey[s] the prosecutor's opinion, which is irrelevant.\" Alfaro-Valleda, 314\nKan. at 538. The use of \"we know\" statements related to disputed or controverted facts or\nto draw conclusions or inferences creates a risk of the prosecutor's opinion\u2014even if\nbased on reasonable inference\u2014being presented as evidence to the jury. However, the\n\"use of a 'we know' statement is not prosecutorial error when the evidence being\ndiscussed is not controverted.\" 314 Kan. at 538.\n\n\n\n                                                    33\n\f       Although he alleges the prosecutor's \"we know\" statements concerned\ncontroverted facts, Kellner fails to identify how the statements are controverted. The first\n\"we know\" statement\u2014that \"[w]e know how the disclosure happened\"\u2014 was an\nuncontroverted fact. The victim's mom testified as to the disclosure, and there was no\nevidence to controvert its occurrence. Kellner attempted to elicit testimony from the\nvictim's mom that the disclosure was nonchalant but did not contest its occurrence.\n\n\n       The second statement regarding the presence of seminal fluid with DNA matching\nKellner was controverted. Although Kellner did not present his own expert, his attorney\nattempted to elicit testimony from the State's expert to draw the DNA and presence of\nseminal fluid into question. Whether Kellner succeeded in drawing the KBI expert's\ntestimony into question is a matter of weight for the jury to decide. State v. Burton, 35\nKan. App. 2d 876, 882, 136 P.3d 945 (2006) (\"It is the jury's prerogative to decide the\ncredibility of witnesses, the weight to be given evidence, and the reasonable inferences to\nbe drawn from the evidence.\"). Therefore, the prosecutor's use of \"we know\" statements\ndrawing inferences from the DNA evidence\u2014no matter how reasonable\u2014was an error.\n\n\n       The third and fourth statements\u2014regarding evidence of Kellner's intent to gratify\nhimself sexually\u2014also referenced a controverted fact. Kellner denied ejaculating or\nleaving seminal fluid on the victim. The prosecutor discussed Kellner's demeanor in the\ninterview and his statements from which the jury could infer Kellner's intent, which\nexceeds the prosecutor's wide latitude. \"A prosecutor inferring from evidence and adding\nthat 'we know' the inference is valid crosses the line by giving the prosecutor's opinion\nabout the strength and meaning of the evidence.\" Alfaro-Valleda, 314 Kan. at 540.\n\n\n       Three of the \"we know\" statements Kellner points to constitute error as they\nreferred to controverted facts, but that is not the end of the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\fThe Prosecutor's Personal Opinion\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that the prosecutor erroneously inserted his personal opinion\ninto the argument by stating:\n\n\n                \"He talks about where he put his penis. The swabs of the DNA show you how\n       lewd it was, because there's seminal fluid there. Remember, there's bruising. Use your\n       common sense. If rubbing against a little girl for 30 minutes with your erection, is that\n       causing any type of injury? You could say: But it could have been anything. It could have\n       been a bicycle accident. I'm not going to believe that. The seminal fluid is not from a\n       bicycle accident. It's from his penis.\"\n\n\nAs Kellner alleges, the prosecutor stating his opinion that the victim's labia bruising\ncould not have been caused from a source other than Kellner is prosecutorial error. The\nprosecutor's opinion statement goes beyond reciting the evidence to create an inference\nfor the jury to draw, and inappropriately completes the inferential loop. State v. Pribble,\n304 Kan. 824, 835, 375 P.3d 966 (2016) (arguing the evidence contradicts the\ndefendant's testimony is acceptable, but a prosecutor's statement that they \"don't believe\"\nthe defendant's statement crosses the line).\n\n\nMisstatement of the Law\n\n\n       Kellner next alleges that the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument\nwhen he said:\n                \"So this is a question that I submit that you need to answer. Did he lewdly fondle\n       or touch her? What does the evidence show you? This is the instruction, the definition of\n       lewd fondling and touching. It's in your packet on both of the counts.\n                \"What you don't see here is whether it's an intentional touching. The intent comes\n       about the sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching? The\n       definition of what the lewd fondling, touching is about, whether the type and manner in\n\n\n                                                   35\n\f       which it occurs would undermine the morals of a child and clearly be offensive to the\n       outrage and moral senses of a reasonable person.\"\n\n\nAs with his previous argument regarding the jury instruction, Kellner asserts that because\nthe prosecutor's explanation of the charge did not include the phrase \"done with\"\nconnecting the lewd touching with the arousal or sexual desire intent, the prosecutor's\nstatement was an incorrect recitation of the law.\n\n\n       As previously explained, the prosecutor's statement of the law was not erroneous.\nFirst, the prosecutor explained the definition of \"lewd fondling or touching\" by pointing\nto the jury instruction. The prosecutor then explained that Kellner's \"intent comes about\nthe sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching?\" In making this\nstatement, the prosecutor explained that Kellner's intent must be connected to his lewd\ntouching of the victim. This is an accurate statement of the law. See also State v. Dinh\nLoc Ta, 296 Kan. 230, 242-43, 290 P.3d 652 (2012) (both intent and a lewd touch are\nnecessary to commit aggravated indecent liberties with a child, but the intent does not\nmake every touch lewd).\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner from the Prosecutorial Errors\n\n\n       After finding four of the prosecutor's statements constitute error, this court must\ndetermine if the defendant was prejudiced by those errors by determining whether \"there\nis no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict.\" Sherman, 305 Kan.\nat 109. Kellner argues that the State cannot meet this burden because there is no evidence\nthat his lewd touching was \"done with\" the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\n\n\n       The court considered several factors to determine harmlessness, including the\nstrength of the evidence, mitigating factors, the prosecutor's statements surrounding the\nerroneous statements, and the strength of the case. See State v. Brown, 316 Kan. 154,\n\n                                                  36\n\f172, 513 P.3d 1207 (2022) (requiring analysis of multiple factors because prejudice may\nbe found even in strong cases). Although the State heavily relies on the overwhelming\nevidence of Kellner's guilt, there is other evidence of harmlessness. First, the district\ncourt mitigated potential prejudice to the defendant by instructing the jury prior to closing\nthat the \"[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are intended to help you in\nunderstanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they're not evidence. If any\nstatements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should be disregarded.\"\nThen again, immediately before the prosecutor's closing argument the judge said, \"[a]nd\nremember . . . that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence.\" Such\ninstructions are intended to ensure that jurors understand the attorneys are advocates for\ntheir case, and that their statements do not constitute evidence. Courts assume that jurors\nunderstand and follow these instructions, and this type of instruction can be weighed by\nappellate courts in determining whether a prosecutor's erroneous statements were\nharmless to the defendant's right to a fair trial. Brown, 316 Kan at 170.\n\n\n       Second, the prosecutor made the erroneous \"we know\" and opinion statements in\nthe context of discussing the evidence supporting those inferences and opinion. Each\nerroneous statement was made during the prosecutor's initial closing argument\u2014which\ncomprised fourteen transcript pages\u2014and were surrounded by statements of\nuncontroverted facts. The prosecutor did not make isolated assertions of opinion, and\nthese erroneous inference statements were based on or supported by the uncontroverted\nfacts of the case. For example, the prosecutor's opinion statement about the cause of the\nvictim's labia injury was presented with the evidence of Kellner's inculpatory statements\nabout his actions, the victim's contemporaneous statement, and the DNA evidence.\nMoreover, the jury was free to disagree with and had been instructed to disregard the\nprosecutor's opinion statement about the cause of the victim's labia injury. This was not a\nrunning theme or repetitive statement but rather an isolated comment within fourteen\npages of argument.\n\n\n                                              37\n\f       Finally, the prosecutor's closing argument demonstrated the strength of the\nprosecutor's case. Kellner's own inculpatory statements made most of the facts\nuncontroverted. The victim very quickly reported Kellner's inappropriate touching. The\nvideo that inspired Kellner's conduct was located, and the seminal fluid with a DNA\nprofile consistent with Kellner was found on the victim's labia. Given the repeated\nmitigating statements from the court, the context of the erroneous statements, the number\nand timing of the erroneous statements in the context of the closing argument, and the\nstrength of the State's case, this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there is\nno reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's erroneous statements contributed to the\nverdict. See Brown, 316 Kan. at 170-72 (finding no prejudice from the prosecutor's \"we\nknow\" statements surrounded with discussions of the evidence that supported the\nconclusions when the inferences were reasonable and the evidence of guilt strong).\n\n\nVII.   CUMULATIVE ERROR DID NOT DEPRIVE KELLNER OF A FAIR TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the prosecutor's improper statements during closing and the\nlack of clarity in the jury instruction\u2014even if individually insufficient to require\nreversal\u2014constitute cumulative error that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCumulative trial errors, when considered together, may require reversal of the defendant's\nconviction when the totality of the circumstances establish that the defendant was\nsubstantially prejudiced by the errors and denied a fair trial. This court analyzes the\ncumulative effect of errors similarly to its analysis of each individual error by examining\nthe errors and how the judge dealt with the errors as they arose in context; evaluating the\nnature and number of errors and whether they are interrelated; and analyzing the overall\nstrength of the evidence. Just as with the individual errors discussed herein, because some\nof the alleged cumulative errors are constitutional, the State must establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the cumulative effect did not affect the outcome of the trial. Alfaro-\nValleda, 314 Kan. at 551-52. But the cumulative error analysis does not apply unless\n\n\n                                             38\n\fmultiple errors have been found. State v. Gonzalez, 307 Kan. 575, 598, 412 P.3d 968\n(2018).\n\n\n       Kellner successfully showed error only in the prosecutor's statements. Had Kellner\nshown the jury instruction was factually or legally erroneous\u2014even if it were not clearly\nerroneous\u2014then it could still be used to evaluate cumulative error to determine if the\ndefendant was deprived of the right to a fair trial. Because he failed to make such a\nshowing, and this court has already evaluated the cumulative effect of the prosecutorial\nerrors, additional inquiry is unnecessary.\n\n\nVIII. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING KELLNER'S\nMOTION FOR DISPOSITIONAL AND DURATIONAL DEPARTURE\n\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his\nmotion for departure and instead sentencing him to life imprisonment with a minimum of\n25 years served. Following trial, Kellner moved for dispositional and durational departure\ndue to: (1) his age, (2) his lack of prior criminal history, (3) mitigating circumstances\nincluding his stress, ADHD diagnosis, and addiction which interfered with his normal\nbehavior, (4) his willingness to abide by conditions set by the court including\nparticipating in programs for family preservation, and (5) that there was less harm in this\ncase than normally associated with this type of crime.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the court noted that the presentence investigation report (PSI) did\nnot provide a criminal history score because Kellner's crime of conviction was an off-grid\nperson felony. However, because Kellner had filed a motion for departure, the court\nnoted for the record that his history would have been \"I,\" meaning he had no scorable\nprior convictions pursuant to the grid. At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended\na life sentence with a mandatory 25-year minimum, and argued there was no substantial\nand compelling reason to depart from that statutory sentence. The victim's mother\n\n                                             39\n\fprovided a statement and asked the \"Court to take into consideration how much this has,\nnot only broken apart my family, but has created a series of kind of lifelong struggles that\nwe have to now deal with because of the actions that Mr. Kellner chose to take on that\nevening.\" The victim's guardian told the court that the victim wanted it \"to know that this\nhas all messed up my family and life since it happened.\"\n\n\n       In support of his motion for departure, Kellner's attorney argued that the\nlegislature used to leave it to families to resolve these types of inter-family issues, but\nnow \"there are situations where the legislature feels that the family needs to be\ncompletely destroyed and an individual sent to prison for essentially the rest of their life.\"\nThe attorney suggested that the court could take the opportunity to avoid destroying the\nfamily and instead treat sentencing as an \"opportunity to repair and rebuild and\nstrengthen the family\" because \"this is a case where family preservation appears to be\nwanted by all the parties.\" He argued the cost to the State for imprisoning Kellner could\nbe better used, and that with supportive services such as counseling, \"[w]e could reunite\nthis family and get them back to a healthy place. And that starts with a dispositional\ndeparture.\" The attorney then stated that \"it's not that big of a risk\" to depart because\nKellner would be on lifetime registration and lifetime parole with the underlying threat of\nreturning to prison if he did not follow through. As a result, departing downward and\nreturning back to the grid would be a \"win-win situation. It's a win for the family; it's a\nwin for the State.\"\n\n\n       Kellner's attorney also argued that Kellner had essentially no prior criminal\nhistory, there were no allegations of vaginal penetration, no allegations of intercourse,\nand no allegations of extensive sexual abuse. Rather, \"this is far from the worst situation\nthat any of us have ever listened to evidence on, or been presented in a courtroom.\"\nFurther, the attorney stated Kellner was suffering from \"some pressure and some stress,\nand so forth, that was involved in the family,\" and may have had an addiction to\npornography.\n\n                                              40\n\f       Kellner then provided his own statement to the court. He stated that he was a\nChristian and \"[i]n this whole process, I've forgiven everybody in this courtroom\u2014the\njury, my own family, and all my coworkers\u2014anybody I've ever come into contact with\nthat I felt was to blame for the reason why my life went the way it went.\" He eventually\nconcluded by stating that \"I love my kids. I love my wife, even to this day, and I forgive\nher, whether she forgives me or not.\"\n\n\n       Before ruling, the district court stated that \"what happened to that six-year-old . . .\nis not a family issue. It has never been a family issue. The legislature and people in the\nstate have never turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children because it happened\nwithin a family.\" Further, the court stated, \"one could argue that nobody involved in this\ncase needs your forgiveness for anything that happened in this case.\"\n\n\n       The court then went on to consider the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented\nwithout weighing them in relation to each other or in relation to any aggravating\ncircumstances. Regarding the evidence presented, the court stated that the DNA analysis\nwas credible and found Kellner's sperm on the victim in the place where she disclosed\nKellner touched her; Kellner admitted to something happening; and the alleged event was\nconsistent with the Japanese video Kellner said inspired him. Further, the court noted that\nit could take into consideration evidence which the State declined to present to the jury\u2014\nincluding that Kellner had \"websites of little kids dressed up in ballet outfits or\nHalloween costumes or nurse's costumes, and things of that nature.\"\n\n\n       The court stated that \"[w]hether it happens once or twice or twenty or a hundred\ntimes, you don't get a pass from molesting a child because it only happened once.\" In\nassessing the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented, the court noted his lack of\ncriminal history and allegation that he was under \"extreme stress.\" The district court\nrecognized that in the interrogation, Kellner spent a lot of time complaining to the officer\n\"about how hard your life was, and how unfair things were for you, and things of that\n\n                                              41\n\fnature. None rise to the level of excusing the behavior in which you were convicted of\nhere.\" Regarding Kellner's argument to preserve the family, the district court stated that it\nunderstood but it \"did not get the impression that the family wishes to\u2014has that same\nwish with you as part of it.\"\n\n\n       After considering the mitigating circumstances, the court found that there were \"no\nsubstantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence in this case.\"\nThe district court sentenced Kellner to a term of imprisonment for life, with a mandatory\nminimum term of 25 years; lifetime sex offender registration; and lifetime parole with\nelectronic monitoring. On appeal, this court must determine whether the sentencing court\nabused its discretion in declining to depart, and Kellner bears the burden of\ndemonstrating such abuse of discretion. State v. Thomas, 307 Kan. 733, 739, 415 P.3d\n430 (2018). \"A district court abuses its discretion when: (1) a ruling is based on an error\nof law; (2) a ruling is based on an error of fact, . . . or (3) a ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable.\" State v. Powell, 308 Kan. 895, 902, 425 P.3d 309 (2018).\n\n\n       When an adult defendant is convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child,\nthey \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life with a mandatory minimum\nterm of imprisonment of not less than 25 years . . . .\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(a)(1).\nHowever, for first time offenders, the court may depart\u2014and give a more lenient\nsentence\u2014if \"the judge finds substantial and compelling reasons, following a review of\nmitigating circumstances . . . .\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(d)(1). Those \"mitigating\ncircumstances\" include, but are not limited to, consideration of the defendant's lack of\nsignificant criminal history, that the defendant committed the crime while \"under the\ninfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbances,\" and the defendant's age at the\ntime of the crime. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6627(d)(2)(A), (B), (F). Also see State v. Jolly,\n301 Kan. 313, 322, 342 P.3d 935 (2015) (the plain language of the Jessica's Law\nsentencing statute instructs the sentencing court to conduct a review of mitigating\ncircumstances without balancing them against any aggravating circumstances).\n\n                                                42\n\f       The district court must first review the mitigating circumstances without weighing\nthem against any aggravating circumstance and then determine whether the mitigating\nfactors are substantial and compelling reason to depart from the mandatory sentence.\nJolly, 301 Kan. at 324. In this context, \"[s]omething is '\"substantial\" if it is \"real, not\nimagined; something with substance and not ephemeral,\" while the term \"compelling\"\nimplies that the court is forced, by the facts of a case, to leave the status quo or go beyond\nwhat is ordinary.'\" Powell, 308 Kan. at 914 (quoting Jolly, 301 Kan. at 323).\n\n\n       Kellner argues the district court failed to properly consider the mitigating factor of\nKellner not having any prior criminal history because it stated that \"[w]hether it happens\nonce or twice or twenty or a hundred times, you don't get a pass from molesting a child\nbecause it only happened once.\" This mischaracterizes the court's statement, which was\nmade in the context of explaining that the legislature requires a certain penalty for the\ncrime of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, and that is true regardless of how\nmany times the crime is committed. Ultimately, the district court stated that it considered\nKellner's lack of criminal history, and there is no indication that it failed to consider the\nfactor. The district court is not required to provide a detailed reason for why it determines\nthat each factor is not substantial enough to warrant departure from the statutory\nsentence. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 908 (Explaining that although the sentencing statute\nrequires a judge to explain the reasons for departure the \"statute does not oblige a district\ncourt to state its reasons for denying a departure motion.\")\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the district court failed to adequately consider his mental and\nemotional disturbance at the time he committed the crime as a mitigating factor. The\nsentencing court stated that it considered Kellner's assertion that the crime was\ncommitted while he was under extreme stress and that Kellner spent a great deal of time\nduring the interrogation talking about his life and why he felt it was unfair. However, the\ncourt then stated these circumstances did not \"rise to the level of excusing the behavior in\nwhich you were convicted of here.\" Kellner alleges that this statement demonstrates the\n\n                                               43\n\fcourt did not \"understand its responsibility to meaningfully consider mitigating\ncircumstances.\" The record indicates otherwise. The district court provided extensive\ndetail on its understanding of the process it was required to follow in sentencing Kellner,\nspecifically avoided inappropriately weighing any potential \"aggravating circumstances,\"\nand stated why it was denying his motion for departure.\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argued that the degree of harm caused in this case was less than\nusually associated with a crime of this nature. He argues the incident with the victim was\nbrief and she hardly remembered it; there was no evidence Kellner planned the\nencounter; he did not force the victim to do anything; he did not threaten victim or injure\nher; and did not hold her down and penetrate her vagina with anything including his\npenis. The victim testified clearly to the details of the assault, and her impact statement\nand the mother's statements at sentencing show Kellner's assault will have a lifetime\nimpact on the victim. Kellner is right that the district court provided no specific comment\nas to this asserted mitigating factor, but it did state that it considered Kellner's motion and\noral argument which meets the requirements when denying a departure motion. See\nPowell, 308 Kan. at 908-09.\n\n\n       The district court explained its reasoning and analysis in denying Kellner's motion\nfor departure. It appears to have considered each of the argued mitigating factors and did\nnot inappropriately weigh \"aggravating circumstances.\" The court's finding was not based\non an error of law or fact, and it was not arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable. While some\npeople or courts may have found Kellner's lack of criminal history and the facts of this\nassault warranted departure, this court cannot say that no reasonable person could take\nthe view adopted by the district court. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 902. \"[E]ven though\nmitigating circumstances must be present for a finding of substantial and compelling\nreasons, mitigating circumstances do not necessarily equal substantial and compelling\nreasons\" to depart. Jolly, 301 Kan. at 323. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner's motion for durational and dispositional departure.\n\n                                              44\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Kellner was convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, a heinous\ncrime against a young victim that affected the life of multiple people. Kellner waived his\nrights under Miranda, voluntarily made inculpatory statements during interrogation, and\nwas responsible for nearly all pretrial delays. The evidence supporting his conviction was\nstrong, and although some errors occurred during the trial, none of those individually or\ncumulatively warrant reversal. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner's motion for dispositional or durational departure. A jury convicted\nKellner of a serious crime, based in part on Kellner's own admissions, and the district\ncourt being in the best position to know all the facts and impact sentenced him\naccordingly. Finding no reversible error, this court affirms.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,086\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                    v.\n\n                                       TIMOTHY E.

Kellner of aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child for his inappropriate touching of the six-year-old victim. He was sentenced\nto the statutory penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years served before\nany possibility of parole. On appeal Kellner claims that his conviction should be\nreversed, and he is entitled to a new trial because trial errors from prosecutorial missteps\nto erroneous jury instructions deprived him of a fair trial. In the event this court was\nunpersuaded to reverse the jury&#x27;s decision based on those alleged errors, he also argues\nthat the district court abused its discretion by denying him a durational or dispositional\n\n                                                    1\n\fdeparture from the presumptive sentence. Despite the litany of errors asserted, this court\nfinds no reversible error and affirms Kellner&#x27;s conviction and sentence.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On February 27, 2019, the State charged Timothy E. Kellner with two counts of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, arising from his alleged abuse of a then six-\nyear-old child on or between February 21 to 22, 2019, and sometime on or between\nDecember 25, 2018, and February 20, 2019. Although the State dismissed one of the\ncounts, after a trial in January 2022 the jury found Kellner guilty of one count of\naggravated indecent liberties with a child. Among Kellner\u2019s many allegations, he claims\nthere was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions, which requires this court to\nrecite the relevant facts underlying his conviction.\n\n\n       At trial the victim testified that she told her mom that Kellner &quot;had touched me in\nmy private&quot; and that her mom took her to talk to the police. The victim said that when she\nwas in her bed in the basement Kellner &quot;came in my room and laid beside me and started\nto pull down my pants. And then [he] had touched me&quot; with his &quot;arm and his hand&quot; on\nthe butt. She later testified that Kellner also pulled down her underwear at that time. On\ncross-examination the victim confirmed that Kellner touched her once in this manner.\n\n\n       The victim&#x27;s mother testified that on the night of February 21, 2019, she and the\nvictim, her daughter, had fallen asleep on the living room couches, but she awoke at\nabout 12:30-1:00 a.m. and went to bed while her daughter continued to sleep on the\ncouch. The next day, on February 22, 2019, the victim&#x27;s mother and her friend were in the\nliving room when the victim &quot;described a scenario from the evening before, at which\n[Kellner] caressed in between her legs with . . . what she believes is his arm.&quot; The\nvictim&#x27;s mother and her friend took the victim to a police substation and met an officer\nwho interviewed the mother and her friend. The Axon video footage of that police\n\n                                              2\n\finterview was admitted at trial. On cross-examination, the victim&#x27;s mother testified that at\nthat time she wanted to talk to Kellner because she did not want to jump to conclusions\nbut confirmed the officer did not allow her to talk to Kellner.\n\n\n       The officer transported the victim and her mother to the Child Advocacy Center\n(CAC) where the victim was interviewed outside the presence of her mother. The officer\nlater transported the victim and her mother to the hospital where nurses photographed and\nswabbed the victim.\n\n\n       The forensic nurse examined the victim at the hospital from 12:32 a.m. until after\n1:30 a.m. and documented on a diagram admitted into evidence that the victim had &quot;red,\npurple bruise with swelling&quot; on the labia majora and &quot;excess skin to the anal area&quot; in the\ntop part of her anus. The forensic nurse also confirmed that she took swabs from the\nvictim&#x27;s labia majora where the bruising was seen, her labia minora, anal area, and the\nspace between her anus and vagina, as well as an oral swab so that they could gather the\nvictim&#x27;s genetic information and compare it to any genetic material found elsewhere on\nher body. The forensic nurse confirmed that she did not see any pubic hairs, lubricants, or\nclothing fibers on the victim. She also confirmed that it was possible for a man to\ndischarge seminal fluid while sleeping.\n\n\n       On cross-examination, the victim&#x27;s mother confirmed that at the time of the\nincident, the victim had a history of wetting the bed and that cleaning her up would\ngenerally require wiping between her legs and in her vaginal area. She also confirmed\nthat Kellner would sometimes clean the victim and the victim would sometimes sleep in\ntheir bed or want to be close to them. Although she testified that the next morning\nKellner told her that he had taken the victim to bed, she confirmed that Kellner did not\nreport changing the victim the night of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The mother&#x27;s friend also testified about the victim&#x27;s disclosure and that the victim\n&quot;came up to her mom and I, and told us that [Kellner] had touched her.&quot; After being\nasked, the victim said she was sure about what happened and then demonstrated that\nKellner touched her on her butt. The friend estimated that about an hour passed between\nthe victim&#x27;s initial disclosure and getting to the police substation.\n\n\n       A detective interviewed the victim at the CAC at about 10:00 p.m. on February 22,\n2019, and a video of the Exploited and Missing Child Unit (EMCU) interview of the\nvictim was admitted at trial. During the EMCU interview, the detective stated that the\nvictim disclosed that two incidents occurred\u2014one after Christmas 2018 and one the night\nbefore the interview. During cross-examination, the detective confirmed that during the\ninitial victim interview she described that Kellner was standing during the incident but\ntestified at trial that he was laying down behind her. The detective also confirmed that a\nfew days after the interview, he spoke to the victim again and she told him that she had a\nwreck on her bicycle and had been scratched by a cat.\n\n\n       The detective also interviewed Kellner late in the evening of February 22, 2019,\nand confirmed that Kellner was able to answer the initial personal information questions,\nappeared to understand the questions, and gave appropriate responses. At trial the\ndetective recounted what Kellner said during the interrogation. The detective testified that\nKellner said &quot;he woke up around 3:00 in the morning. Went upstairs. Found [the victim]\nasleep on the couch . . . So he carried her back downstairs and placed her in bed.&quot; The\ndetective stated that during the interrogation, Kellner was very talkative about things\nirrelevant to the case but that he did not seem overly nervous. Kellner stated that he\npulled down the victim&#x27;s pants and was &quot;rubbing his penis in between her legs.&quot; After that\ndisclosure, the detective testified that Kellner explained that when he was carrying the\nvictim, she told him that she loved him and &quot;that that&#x27;s what set things in motion.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       During the interrogation Kellner explained that he accessed a video on his phone\nfrom the internet that he characterized as a Japanese video with a young-looking girl\nwhose father character in the video did something similar to the girl. The detective\nconfirmed that Kellner was describing placing his penis between the victim&#x27;s legs. After\nobtaining a search warrant for Kellner&#x27;s phone, the detective was able to view the video\nKellner described.\n\n\n       The detective confirmed that Kellner was not permitted to speak to his wife or\nother family during the interrogation. The detective also confirmed that during the\ninterrogation he was not wearing a firearm and was wearing a badge that was likely\ncovered by his jacket. However, the detective denied that Kellner was handcuffed and\nstated that Kellner &quot;could have asked to leave&quot; but confirmed that Kellner was placed in a\nlocked interrogation room with no windows and no phone and would have needed\nassistance to leave. The detective testified that Kellner likely sat in the interrogation room\nprior to the interrogation for about an hour and 15 minutes. The detective confirmed that\nhe continued to question Kellner despite knowing that he had a cold, had little sleep, and\nwas tired.\n\n\nThe Video and Forensic Data\n\n\n       A digital forensic examiner with the Wichita Police Department EMCU, Internet\nCrimes Against Children Task Force, testified that she examined Kellner&#x27;s cell phone and\ncreated a report. She found the video described by Kellner as the Japanese video in the\nphone&#x27;s deleted area \u2014 meaning it had previously been stored on the phone. The digital\nforensic examiner confirmed that in searching Kellner&#x27;s cell phone she identified that he\nhad searched for pornography at 4:00 a.m. on the date of the alleged incident. The report\nshowing Kellner&#x27;s relevant internet searches were admitted at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       A KBI forensic scientist testified that she received a synopsis of the allegations\nand the victim&#x27;s sexual assault kit. She explained that after swabbing the victim&#x27;s labia\nmajora and buttocks, she conducted two different tests for seminal fluid on the swabs.\nThe first chemical indicator test was negative for the presence of seminal fluid, but when\nshe viewed the swabs through a microscope she saw sperm, indicating the presence of\nseminal fluid. She then conducted a DNA profile analysis of the seminal fluid on the\nswab which revealed that the DNA profile from the seminal fluid was consistent with\nKellner&#x27;s DNA profile. The forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-\nejaculation or ejaculation and that there &quot;needs to be some sort of stimulation and release\nin order for seminal fluid to be present.&quot; She confirmed that seminal fluid could be\nproduced during a &quot;wet dream&quot; and leak through clothing onto other items and confirmed\nthat DNA can be transferred by contact such as if a person picks up another.\n\n\n       A former crime scene investigator with the Wichita Police Department testified\nthat during the search of Kellner&#x27;s home they used an alternative light source to identify\nfluids such as urine, semen, and sweat stains on the victim&#x27;s bedsheets. However, stains\nidentified on the bedsheets did not indicate the presence of seminal fluid. So, there was\nno semen found on the victim&#x27;s bedsheets.\n\n\n       The jury found Kellner guilty of one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a\nchild, and the State dismissed the second count. Kellner, through his attorney, moved for\ndispositional and durational departure. After a hearing on the motion, the district court\ndenied Kellner&#x27;s motion and he was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25\nyears. Kellner appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Kellner appeals his conviction alleging the following errors: (1) the district court\nerred in admitting his statements made during interrogation; (2) the district court erred in\nfinding he waived his rights under Miranda v.

Kellner was taken to the CAC in the\nback of a police car and the detective confirmed that the police car door was probably\nlocked. Once inside the CAC, the detective testified that Kellner was brought directly to\n\n                                                    8\n\fan interview room, which locks the person inside, and the police interrogation started at\nabout 11:00 p.m. The video recording of the interrogation was admitted into evidence and\nshows that prior to questioning, Kellner denied having consumed illegal drugs or alcohol\nwithin the previous 24 hours but said he had taken ibuprofen and Nyquil or Dayquil due\nto a cold. He stated that he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that &quot;I&#x27;ve\nhad special ed,&quot; that he had slept the previous night from 8:30 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. and\nconfirmed that he understood the questions being asked. However, when asked, Kellner\ncould not recall his children&#x27;s birthdays and said, &quot;My brain is just not, I&#x27;m trying to\nfigure out what&#x27;s going on, trying to process why I&#x27;m here and what is going on in my\nworld right now and so my brain isn&#x27;t where it needs to be.&quot;\n\n\n       After gathering initial information from Kellner, at approximately 11:20 p.m., the\ndetective notified Kellner they wanted to talk to him about a report that had been made\nand said &quot;because you&#x27;re sitting down here in a room at a police station I&#x27;m going to go\nover your rights so you&#x27;re aware of what your rights are . . . and then once we get to that\nif you want to talk to me then we&#x27;ll get into why we&#x27;re here, okay.&quot; The detective gave\nKellner a paper copy of his Miranda rights individually listed and a pen, then read\nthrough each right one at a time and asked Kellner each time whether he understood the\nright. Kellner verbally acknowledged that he understood his rights and initialed each line.\nThe detective also explained that &quot;you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and\nnot answer any questions or make any statements&quot; and Kellner said he understood that\nright. The detective then asked Kellner if he wanted to talk. Kellner paused for several\nseconds and responded, &quot;I&#x27;d just like to know what&#x27;s going on.&quot; He then paused again for\nabout 20 seconds and eventually said &quot;Yeah.&quot; Kellner signed and dated the Miranda\nform, demonstrating he was willing to talk to the police at that time.\n\n\n       Before any questioning, Kellner knew that he was at the police station related to a\nreport from his wife. The detective had explained that &quot;a lot of times reports are made\nand, you know, we get a small piece of the puzzle \u2026 we won&#x27;t know the full story until\n\n                                              9\n\fwe talk to you about it.&quot; Kellner later said &quot;I wish my wife would just talk to me. She just\nleaves and goes [to] Walmart and calls the cops on her husband.&quot; The detective then said,\n&quot; you know obviously a report was made tonight, um, saying some things had happened,\nyou know, earlier today or last night . . . .&quot;\n\n\n       Throughout the interview, Kellner talked about his home life, work schedule, the\nhome layout, where his kids sleep in the home, and how he feels like his life just consists\nof work and sleep and that he and his wife had been arguing. Kellner offered random\ninformation about his life\u2014chaos with the kids, lack of money, and accused his wife of\n&quot;planting things into [the kids&#x27;] heads.&quot; Eventually, the detective asked Kellner if he was\nhaving a hard time communicating, and Kellner responded &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m ADHD so I\nmean. . . . My mind breaks down into like a thousand different things.&quot; The detective\ntried to redirect Kellner to the victim&#x27;s allegations, but Kellner was reluctant to talk about\nthe allegations.\n\n\nKellner&#x27;s Inculpatory Statements\n\n\n       The detective suggested that perhaps Kellner put the victim in her bed and his\n&quot;mind slipped to a place it shouldn&#x27;t have been for a minute&quot; and that the victim described\nit in a way to indicate that Kellner &quot;realized what&#x27;s going on isn&#x27;t right and it stopped.&quot; In\nresponse, Kellner said, &quot;That&#x27;s all I could think about at work today,&quot; and the detective\nasked if Kellner was referring to &quot;what happened last night.&quot; Kellner then asked, &quot;Have\nyou ever had those moments where you just wish you could beat yourself up?&quot; Kellner\nexplained that he was &quot;scared&quot; because the detective had &quot;the power to essentially ruin\nmy life,&quot; and said that the detective had &quot;the power to take something that&#x27;s not in family\nhistory, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s not in my upbringing.&quot; When the detective again asked what\nhappened with the victim, Kellner stated that his wife watches crime shows so he has\n&quot;seen how all this ends,&quot; that he would not be allowed to leave, and &quot;if I keep going\nforward that&#x27;s exactly where I&#x27;m going to end.&quot;\n\n                                                 10\n\f       When the detective asked if Kellner laid down in the bed with the victim after he\nbrought her downstairs Kellner replied, &quot;Well I&#x27;m beat, I&#x27;m tired.&quot; The detective said,\n&quot;You&#x27;re not saying no.&quot; Kellner then stated that he was tired and &quot;running on hardly any\nsleep.&quot; He then said, &quot;But I did not have a relationship with [the victim],&quot; to which the\ndetective said that the victim was not describing that but was &quot;describing something very\nclose to that.&quot; That is when Kellner said, &quot;I may have rubbed up against her&quot; with a &quot;hard\non.&quot;\n\n\n       After Kellner confirmed that he had an erection while lying next to the victim, the\ndetective asked a series of questions about how Kellner&#x27;s penis became exposed during\nthat time. Kellner then said, &quot;I did make a mistake,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s crazy, one hour of my life,&quot; and\n&quot;It&#x27;s not even one hour it&#x27;s more like thirty minutes of my life.&quot; Kellner denied ejaculating\nwhile with the victim and explained that he went back to his room and ejaculated\n&quot;[b]ecause who I really wanted to be with was my wife.&quot; The detective asked what part of\nthe victim touched Kellner&#x27;s penis and he said, &quot;Between her legs man.&quot; Kellner\neventually explained that the victim said she loved him, and &quot;[m]aybe what turned me on\nis the fact that [the victim] actually loved me.&quot; He had previously stated that &quot;[i]t was\nbeing close to her and just knowing that somebody loved you.&quot; Kellner said, &quot;the fact that\nit feels like somebody else obviously loves you or shows affection to you that your wife\nis not showing you.&quot; Kellner stated twice that &quot;I gave the wrong affection to the wrong\nperson,&quot; and that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t planned&quot; and &quot;it was a mistake.&quot; He explained that his actions\nmimicked &quot;something I saw on the video&quot; showing a Japanese father with his daughter.\n\n\n       At approximately 1:40 a.m., the detective left and Kellner was given a smoke\nbreak. As the detective was leaving the room, Kellner said, &quot;My life is going to be ruined\nby one mistake,&quot; to which the detective replied, &quot;That isn&#x27;t up to me.&quot; The detective\nreturned at 2:22 a.m. and asked if Kellner would consent to a search of his phone. Kellner\nexpressed concern that he had made a bad choice, and that he did not &quot;have legal\nrepresentation here, I don&#x27;t know nothing about any of this process&quot; and that &quot;I can tell\n\n                                             11\n\fyou now it never ends well.&quot; The detective repeatedly asked Kellner to make a decision\nabout the phone, and told Kellner he could refuse. Kellner never responded so the\ndetective took his refusal to respond to be a no, and concluded the interview. When\nKellner asked the detective what he was supposed to do, the detective responded, &quot;That&#x27;s\nnot an answer I can give you.&quot; The detective eventually notified Kellner he would be\ngoing to jail, and the evidence would be submitted to the district attorney&#x27;s office. The\ninterview concluded at approximately 2:30 a.m.\n\n\nThe State&#x27;s Jackson v. Denno Hearing\n\n\n       At the State&#x27;s request and before the trial began, the district court held a hearing to\ndetermine whether Kellner&#x27;s interview statements were voluntarily made under the\ntotality of the circumstances. The district court found that Kellner&#x27;s mental state\nsupported a finding of voluntariness because Kellner was able to understand and respond\nto the detective&#x27;s questions appropriately and did not appear to be under the influence,\nthough he was tired and veered off topic several times. Regarding the manner and\nduration of the interview, the court noted that Kellner was not under arrest or handcuffed,\nhe was given water and a smoke break, he was offered food, and the interview was not\nparticularly lengthy, which supported a finding of voluntariness. However, the interview\nwas late at night, Kellner was tired, he was driven to the CAC in a police car, was\nescorted inside by an officer, and was then locked inside an interrogation room. The court\nexplained that the detective acted fairly in conducting the interrogation, weighing in favor\nof voluntariness, as evidenced by the lack of threats or promises used, that the detective\ndid not raise his voice and accommodated Kellner&#x27;s tendency to go off topic. The court\nfound Kellner&#x27;s age and intellect also indicated voluntariness, though it did not describe\nits reasoning. The audio recording of the interrogation was admitted as evidence at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fKellner&#x27;s Mental State\n\n\n       Kellner claims that his mental state weighs in favor of finding his statements\ninvoluntary because his ADHD, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, anxiety, and tiredness\nduring the interview made it difficult for him to understand and communicate. He also\nalleges that the detective implied that it would be in Kellner&#x27;s best interest to confess, and\nthat a competency evaluation showed that Kellner needed things explained to him slowly.\nThe video and transcript of Kellner&#x27;s interview clearly demonstrate that he had difficulty\nstaying focused, staying on topic, and appropriately responding to prompts from the\ndetective. Though Kellner&#x27;s lack of focus could relate to his ADHD or other mental\nconditions, it could also be viewed as his desire to evade the topic. He verbalized his\nthoughts, answered direct questions, said he was worried about the consequences of his\nstatements, and clearly understood the questions and reason they were being asked. Much\nof Kellner&#x27;s off-topic discussion includes shifting blame to his wife and lengthy\nexplanations or excuses for his behavior\u2014demonstrating that Kellner understood the\ndetective&#x27;s questions and why he was being interviewed. Kellner also made several\nstatements demonstrating that he understood the detective was attempting to get Kellner\nto inculpate himself and that disclosure could lead to Kellner facing legal consequences.\nAlthough it is likely that Kellner was tired, he did not request to cease questioning but in\nfact continued talking and offering information for the entire interview. There is\nsubstantial competent evidence supporting the district court&#x27;s determination that Kellner&#x27;s\nmental state did not render his statements involuntary. See Lowery, 308 Kan. at 1222-23\n(declining to reweigh the evidence where the court found he was &quot;&#x27;responsive&#x27;&quot; to\nquestioning and not impaired by a lack of sleep or possible head injury).\n\n\nThe Manner and Duration of the Interview\n\n\n       Kellner was unrestrained during the interrogation, had access to water, was given a\nbreak to smoke, and the interrogation was relatively short, lasting less than three and a\n\n                                             13\n\fhalf hours including breaks. Additionally, the interviewing detective remained calm\nthroughout: he did not raise his voice, did not act physically imposing, did not threaten\nKellner, and did not engage in deception. Moreover, Kellner began making statements\nindicating knowledge of wrongdoing within an hour and a half. Although the interview\noccurred late at night and into the early morning hours, the totality of the interview\ndemonstrates that the late hour did not impact the manner of the interview in such a way\nas to make Kellner&#x27;s statements involuntary. See e.g., Mattox, 305 Kan. at 1045 (finding\nstatements voluntary when the interviewer remained calm, the interrogation was about\nthree hours long, and the defendant began confessing shortly after the start of the\ninterrogation).\n\n\n       Kellner claims that he was denied requests to communicate with the outside world,\nspecifically that he was denied the ability to speak to his wife, who was his primary\nsupport, which made his statements involuntary. &quot;While isolation from the outside world\ncan be a factor in making an interrogation coercive, it is to be expected that police will\ntake steps to limit the ability of potential witnesses and suspects to communicate and,\npotentially, conspire during an investigation.&quot; Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628003/state-v-walker/\">283 Kan. at 598</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Additionally,\ndenial of a request to contact the outside world is not coercive where the defendant&#x27;s\nrequest &quot;suggest[ed] his motivation for seeking outside contact was to gather information\nand, in turn, explains the police officers&#x27; reluctance to grant his request.&quot; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628003/state-v-walker/\">283 Kan. at 598</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nKellner knew that his wife called the police, and Kellner indicated that is why he wanted\nto talk to her. Kellner wanted information from his wife about the investigation and\nallegations, and the detectives very reasonably denied his request to speak to her. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628003/state-v-walker/\">283\nKan. at 598</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\nKellner&#x27;s Age, Intellect, and Background\n\n\n       On appeal, Kellner argues that his age, intellect, and background do not support a\nfinding that his statements were voluntary under the circumstances. Although Kellner\n\n                                             14\n\fcompleted high school, took some technical classes at a community college, and\nmaintained employment, he claims that he also took special education courses\n&quot;throughout his life.&quot; Although Kellner had ADHD and some special education courses, a\nsocial worker who assessed his competency to stand trial found him of average intellect.\nAt the time of interrogation, he was 34 years old, had attended &quot;some college,&quot; worked as\na diesel tech and had an employment history. Moreover, during the interrogation, Kellner\nappeared to understand why he was there and why he was being asked the questions, and\nthe interrogators did not deceive him about the available evidence. Substantial competent\nevidence supports the district court&#x27;s finding that, under the totality of the circumstances,\nKellner&#x27;s age, intellect, and background demonstrate he made voluntary statements to\npolice officers.\n\n\nFairness of Interrogation Techniques\n\n\n       Kellner next argues the detective acted unfairly in conducting the interrogation by\ntelling Kellner the outcome would be better for him if he told the truth. He refers to the\ndetective&#x27;s statement that &quot;&#x27;when it&#x27;s all said and done I can say you know what, Tim\nmade a mistake but he owned up to it,&#x27;&quot; and that &quot;&#x27;if we can talk about why that happened\nand if it&#x27;s just a, a lapse in judgment that something happened for a moment that should\nnot have happened, let&#x27;s talk about that.&#x27;&quot; Unlike other cases where interrogators have\npromised or threatened outcomes related to the interrogee&#x27;s statements\u2014here, the\ndetective did not cross that line. The detective&#x27;s statements are general advice about how\nKellner&#x27;s actions and willingness to be truthful could be viewed by the detective. &quot;&#x27;[M]ere\nadvice or admonition to the defendant to speak the truth, which does not import either a\nthreat or benefit, will not make a following confession incompetent.&#x27;&quot; State v. Farmer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623034\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623034/state-v-farmer/\">285 Kan. 541</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623034\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623034/state-v-farmer/\">175 P.3d 221</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008) (quoting State v.

The detective did not threaten worse treatment or promise benefits related to\nKellner talking.\n\n                                             15\n\f       Moreover, the detective explicitly said he could not make Kellner any guarantees\nor promises about the outcome, and Kellner acknowledged he understood. Kellner said\nthat his fear of repercussions was keeping him from talking freely and said, &quot;The only\nway I can talk about it then is if you tell me what they&#x27;re going to do to me.&quot; The\ndetective replied that &quot;when I&#x27;m done talking to you I&#x27;m going to talk to my supervisor\nand a decision is going to be made.&quot; When Kellner expressed concern about what would\nbe done to him, the detective responded by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything to you.\nOkay. But we need to talk about this.&quot; Lastly, Kellner stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going\nto happen to me man,&quot; and the detective replied that he didn&#x27;t know what was going to\nhappen to Kellner but that he had seen cases go &quot;all which ways.&quot; The detective avoided\npromising Kellner leniency or a change in circumstance that could result from Kellner&#x27;s\nstatements, which does not tend to show coercion. See State v. Swanigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508499/state-v-swanigan/\">279 Kan. 18</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n39, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508499/state-v-swanigan/\">106 P.3d 39</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005) (finding threats of specific charges or increased penalty under the\nother circumstances of the interrogation showed the statements were not voluntary).\n\n\n       Kellner also claims that the detective&#x27;s faux empathy and claims of helping\neffectively diluted the Miranda warning by decreasing Kellner&#x27;s understanding that the\ndetective was an adversary. However, Kellner&#x27;s own statements during the interrogation\nundermine his assertion on appeal. Kellner told the detective &quot;I know exactly what your\njob is,&quot; and that he had seen crime shows and knows &quot;exactly how this works.&quot; Kellner\nalso said that that he understood &quot;[y]ou&#x27;re not going to let me walk out of this place.&quot; He\nalso expressed that talking to the detective could &quot;essentially ruin my life.&quot; Nothing about\nKellner&#x27;s actions during the interrogation, his age, experience, or relationship with the\ninterrogating officer demonstrated that he believed the detective was acting as anything\nother than a legal authority investigating a report of wrongdoing.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances, including the manner and duration of the\ninterrogation, Kellner&#x27;s intellect and age, his inability to communicate with his wife, and\nthe fairness of the interrogation techniques, demonstrate that Kellner&#x27;s will was not\n\n                                             16\n\foverborne and that his statements were freely and voluntarily made.

THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING KELLNER WAIVED HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently\u2014\neither expressly or implicitly\u2014waive his right to remain silent during the interrogation.\n\n\n       The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords individuals the\nright to not be compelled to incriminate themselves. See e.g. Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\">384\nU.S. at 439</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Typically, whether a\ndefendant&#x27;s statements to law enforcement were voluntarily made\u2014as discussed above\u2014\nis a separate determination from whether the defendant waived their Miranda rights.\nKhalil-Alsalaami, 313 Kan. at 500; see also Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483. However, when as\n\n                                             17\n\fhere the waiver is arguably implicit, &quot;the issue of whether the defendant waived his or her\nMiranda rights can be virtually indistinguishable from the issue of whether the\ndefendant&#x27;s statement was voluntary.&quot; Mattox, 280 Kan. at 483.\n\n\n       The totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Kellner knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently waived\u2014whether explicitly or implicitly\u2014his right to\nremain silent. The detective told Kellner that he wanted to talk to Kellner about a report\nthat was made to learn the whole story. He explained that because Kellner was sitting in a\npolice station, he wanted to go over Kellner&#x27;s rights so that Kellner was &quot;aware of what\n[his] rights are.&quot; He then read through each right, asked Kellner if he understood them,\nand asked Kellner to initial if he understood the rights. This list of rights included\nKellner&#x27;s right to decide at any time to invoke his right to remain silent and not answer\nany questions or make any statements, his right to speak to a lawyer, or have a lawyer\nappointed\u2014all of which Kellner acknowledged. Kellner verbally answered that he\nunderstood each right. The detective then asked, &quot;[H]aving these rights in mind do you\nwish to talk to me now?&quot; After a short pause, and expressing his desire to speak to his\nwife, Kellner eventually said, &quot;[Y]eah&quot; and signed and dated the form that he agreed to\nwaive his rights. There can be few more explicit acts to demonstrate waiver. Kellner did\nnot say he was confused about his rights, did not ask questions about the Miranda rights\nwhen they were explained, and never expressed his desire to exercise them at any time\nlater in the interrogation.\n\n\n       Although the detective did not fully explain the underlying reason for\nadministering Kellner&#x27;s Miranda rights or the possible consequences of the interrogation,\nthis lack of disclosure was not deceptive and was not required. This court has reviewed\nmany interrogations where officers openly explained that the Miranda rights were being\nprovided because the accused was facing possible criminal charges, and still the accused\nvoluntarily waived their rights and made inculpatory statements. Although that scenario\nis preferred, officers are not required to rise to that level of disclosure. See e.g., Parker,\n\n                                               18\n\f311 Kan. at 258-59 (finding that officers met the minimum requirements by giving the\naccused a written copy of his Miranda rights and reading the rights aloud even though\nthey did not ask if he understood the rights). While the reason for giving Kellner his\nMiranda rights could have been more thorough, the detective did tell Kellner that the\npolice received a report, and the detective wanted to ask him questions related to that\nreport. Kellner also knew that his wife had called the police and that\u2014as he expressed\nduring the interrogation\u2014police investigate crimes and talking to them could have\nsignificant consequences. The detective did not deceive Kellner about the reason for the\ndetective&#x27;s questions or the reason for the Miranda rights.\n\n\n       The detective read Kellner each Miranda right, asked if he understood them,\nallowed Kellner to initial his understanding, and then asked Kellner if he wished to waive\nthe rights and talk to the detective. Under the totality of these circumstances, Kellner\nexpressly and knowingly waived his Miranda rights and voluntarily talked to the\ndetective. Even if Kellner&#x27;s waiver were insufficient to be explicit, his actions also\ndemonstrate an implicit waiver. When, as here, there is no evidence of coercion, a\ndefendant can implicitly waive their right to remain silent by confirming they understand\ntheir rights and engaging in conduct that demonstrates waiver, such as talking.

THE STATE DID NOT VIOLATE KELLNER&#x27;S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial\nbecause his case was pending for two years and ten months before the trial. The Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\u2014which is applicable to the states through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2014provides that &quot;the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n\n                                             19\n\fand public trial.&quot; State v.

Unlike\nKansas&#x27;s statutory right to speedy trial under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-3402, which provides\na specific number of days within which to bring a defendant to trial, the constitutional\nspeedy trial right does not create a strict timeframe. Rather, whether a trial is speedy\ndepends on the circumstances of each case. State v.

Assuming this almost three-\nyear delay is presumptively prejudicial, as did the district court, this court considers the\nother factors to determine if Kellner&#x27;s constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.\n\n\nReason for Delay\n\n\n       Kellner acknowledges that his trial date was repeatedly delayed to accommodate\nhis three counsel changes, allow a competency evaluation, and due to the COVID-19\npandemic which halted trials for several months. The State did not request any\ncontinuances of the trial date. Kellner argues this factor should not weigh against him\nbecause the delays were due to &quot;more neutral reason[s].&quot; Although Kellner classifies his\nrequested continuances for trial preparation and a competency evaluation as &quot;neutral,&quot;\nthis court disagrees. See Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629247/state-v-rivera/\">277 Kan. at 117</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (where the court found defendant&#x27;s\nrequests for continuance to prepare attributable to the defendant).\n\n\n       Here, only one delay is attributable to the State\u2014the time between the October\n2019 preliminary hearing and November 2019 jury trial control date. The rest of the\ncontinuances were attributable to Kellner to allow him to seek new counsel, allow his\nnew counsel time to prepare, and to allow his counsel to seek a competency evaluation of\nhim. As a result, this factor weights against Kellner.\n\n\nKellner&#x27;s Assertion of the Right to Speedy Trial\n\n\n       Although it is the State&#x27;s obligation to timely bring a defendant to trial, the court\ncan weigh a defendant&#x27;s efforts to assert their right to a speedy trial. &quot;&#x27;[F]ailure to assert\n\n                                               21\n\fthe right will make it difficult for the defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy\ntrial.&#x27;&quot; Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629247/state-v-rivera/\">277 Kan. at 117</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Kellner first asserted his right to a speedy trial by filing a\npro se motion on November 24, 2021\u2014roughly two years and nine months after the State\nbrought charges against him. His attorney then filed a motion asserting his right to speedy\ntrial on January 8, 2022\u2014shortly before the scheduled trial.\n\n\n          Kellner waited until shortly before trial to assert his right, when little more could\nbe done to speed up the process, and only after repeatedly causing and requesting\ncontinuances of the trial date. This factor does not weigh against the State.\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner\n\n\n          Ultimately, the most important factor in this analysis is whether and to what\nextent, if any, Kellner was prejudiced by the delay. In analyzing whether the defendant\nsuffered prejudice, this court determines whether the defendant suffered (1) oppressive\npretrial incarceration, (2) constitutionally cognizable anxiety, (3) or impairment to the\nability to present a defense. Harris v. Champion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6929658\"><a href=\"/opinion/7027901/harris-v-champion/\">15 F.3d 1538</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1559 (10th Cir. 1994).\nThe most important of these factors is the last because &quot;the inability of a defendant\nadequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.&quot; Weaver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2549249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2549249/state-v-weaver/\">276 Kan.\nat 511</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n          Kellner argues that his liberty was significantly restrained pre-trial for almost three\nyears which also caused him anxiety. Even assuming that the almost three-year pretrial\nincarceration was oppressive, there is no evidence that Kellner suffered particularized\nanxiety violative of his constitutional rights. A defendant asserting a cognizable claim for\nprejudice stemming from anxiety associated with prolonged pretrial incarceration must\nmake a &quot;&#x27;particularized and substantial showing of anxiety distinguishable from anxiety\nsuffered by other similarly situated defendants.&#x27;&quot; State v. Hurst, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">62 Kan. App. 2d 614</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n623, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">521 P.3d 1</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022) (quoting State v. Bussart-Savaloja, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512453\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512453/state-v-bussart-savaloja/\">40 Kan. App. 2d 916</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925,\n\n                                                22\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512453\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512453/state-v-bussart-savaloja/\">198 P.3d 163</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [2008]). Kellner asserts no allegations of particularized anxiety associated\nwith his pretrial incarceration.\n\n\n       Kellner lastly argues that the delay impacted his ability to assert a defense. Kellner\nclaims that the following line of trial testimony where the victim was unable to remember\ncertain details resulted from the trial delay and affected his ability to cross examine her:\n\n\n       &quot;Q.    Okay. And your testimony was that it was like with his arm or his hand?\n       &quot;A.    Yes.\n       &quot;Q.    Okay. Do you know if there was like a towel or some sort of clothing or\n       something that maybe was in his hands?\n       &quot;A.    No.\n       &quot;Q.    You don&#x27;t know, or you - -\n       &quot;A.    I don&#x27;t know.\n       &quot;Q.    Pardon me?\n       &quot;A.    I don&#x27;t really know.\n       ...\n       &quot;Q.    Okay. Also, do you remember back in that timeframe liking to sleep with your\n       mom?\n       &quot;A.    Sometimes.\n       &quot;Q.    And liking to sleep with your dad sometimes?\n       &quot;A.    I don&#x27;t remember that.\n       &quot;Q.    Okay. How about sleeping with your sister?\n       &quot;A.    Yes, I remember that.&quot;\n\n\n       While the victim testified that she did not recall facts related to a couple of\nquestions, such responses are not abnormal nor are they necessarily attributable to the\ndelay in trial. The victim was young\u2014under age seven\u2014at the time of the incident and\nstill young at the time of trial which makes it understandable that she may not recall\ndetails from her childhood. Moreover, Kellner fails to show how the victim&#x27;s memory\nlapses as to these facts impeded his defense. The victim&#x27;s memory as to these facts is not\n\n\n                                                23\n\fexculpatory, and if she had recalled in the negative as to either question, her testimony\ncould have been worse for the defendant. This court cannot guess or assume how Kellner\nbelieves the victim&#x27;s inability to recall in the cited circumstances hurt his ability to form a\ndefense. Nor has he shown that the victim at such a young age would have recalled more\nas to these questions in a manner that would have helped his case had the trial proceeded\nearlier.\n\n\n       Here, the prejudice factors weigh heavily in favor of the State. Although the delay\nin the trial date was presumptively prejudicial, Kellner ultimately did not suffer any\nprejudice from that delay that violated his constitutional rights. Kellner caused, created,\nor requested most of the delays, he failed to assert his right to speedy trial until shortly\nbefore trial, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay.\n\n\nIV.    THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT KELLNER TOUCHED THE MINOR VICTIM\nWITH THE INTENT TO AROUSE OR SATISFY SEXUAL DESIRES\n\n\n\n       Kellner claims the State failed to prove that his lewd touching of the victim was\n&quot;done with&quot; the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires, and thus the State failed to\nprove he violated the aggravated indecent liberties with a child statute. The aggravated\nindecent liberties with a child statute under which Kellner was convicted provides that:\n\n\n       &quot;(b) Aggravated indecent liberties with a child is:\n       &quot;. . .\n       &quot;(3) engaging in any of the following acts with a child who is under 14 years of age:\n       &quot;(A) Any lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the offender, done\n       or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of either the child\n       or the offender, or both.&quot; K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A).\n\n\nKellner argues that &quot;[a] person might engage in lewd touching for other reasons or for no\nreason and might separately have an intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.&quot; He claims,\n                                                    24\n\f&quot;The record is devoid of any evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that any\ntouching in this case was done with the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.&quot; He\ndoes not claim that he was not sexually aroused, but claims the lewd touching was not\nwhat caused his arousal but that he was aroused because the victim said she loved him,\nand then he satisfied his sexual desire away from the victim.\n\n\n       This court reviews a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by reviewing the\nevidence in the most favorable light to the State &quot;to determine whether a rational\nfactfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; without\nreweighing the credibility of the evidence. State v. Aguirre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">313 Kan. 189</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">485 P.3d\n576</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021). This is a high burden, and this court will not reverse a guilty verdict without\nfinding the evidence &quot;so incredible that no reasonable fact-finder could find guilt beyond\na reasonable doubt.&quot; State v. Meggerson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">312 Kan. 238</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">474 P.3d 761</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2020).\n\n\n       Kellner fails to present evidence to meet this high burden. Although Kellner did\nnot admit his intent in touching the victim, that is not required. &quot;Intent is usually proven\nby inference arising from circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of a\ndefendant&#x27;s state of mind is rarely available.&quot; State v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">311 Kan. 281</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">460\nP.3d 348</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2020).

I wanted to be close\nto my wife.&quot; The evidence presented at trial was that seminal fluid consistent with\nKellner&#x27;s DNA profile was found on the victim&#x27;s labia and the KBI forensic scientist\n\n                                             25\n\ftestified that there &quot;needs to be some sort of stimulation and release in order for seminal\nfluid to be present.&quot; In closing, Kellner&#x27;s counsel argued that the victim&#x27;s description was\nconsistent with Kellner cleaning her after she wet the bed, that the detective\nacknowledged to Kellner that he did not believe Kellner&#x27;s actions were intentional, and\nthat Kellner would not have left the victim after getting an erection if he wished to satisfy\nhis sexual desires with her.\n\n\n       The evidence most favorable to the State is sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder\nto infer that Kellner lewdly touched the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire and thus find him guilty of aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nV.     THE JURY INSTRUCTION CONTAINED THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AGGRAVATED\nINDECENT LIBERTIES WITH A CHILD\n\n\n\n       The parties agreed, without objection from Kellner, to use the standard PIK Crim.\n4th 55.121 (2016 Supp.) jury instruction language for the aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child charges. The jury instruction stated:\n\n\n       &quot;INSTRUCTION 6\n               &quot;In count one, the defendant is charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a\n       child. The defendant pleads not guilty.\n               &quot;To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n               &quot;1. The defendant engaged in lewd fondling or touching of [the victim].\n               &quot;2. The defendant intended to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the\n       defendant.\n               &quot;3. At the time of the act, [the victim] was less than 14 years old.\n               &quot;4. The defendant was 18 or more years old at the time the act occurred.\n               &quot;5. This act occurred on or between the 21st day of February, 2019 and the 22nd\n       day of February, 2019 in Sedgwick County, Kansas.\n\n\n                                                   26\n\f                &quot;&#x27;Lewd fondling or touching&#x27; means fondling or touching in a manner which\n       tends to undermine the morals of a child and is so clearly offensive as to outrage the\n       moral senses of a reasonable person. Lewd fondling or touching does not require contact\n       with the sex organ of one or the other.\n\n\n                &quot;The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\n       defendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant&#x27;s desire or conscious objective to do\n       the act complained about by the State.&quot;\n\n\nThe elements of the instruction and definition of &quot;lewd fondling or touching&quot; are\nconsistent with the PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea of\nintent, is consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th 52.010\n(2021 Supp.).\n\n\n       Kellner argues for the first time on appeal that the provided jury instruction failed\nto connect the element of lewd fondling with the element of arousal or sexual desire and\nthus misstated the law. This court evaluates alleged jury instruction errors using a three-\nstep process to determine whether (1) there is appellate jurisdiction; (2) error occurred;\nand (3) any identified errors require reversal. Whether the defendant preserved their\nclaim for appeal at step one impacts any reversibility inquiry at step three. Before\nevaluating reversibility, this court must determine whether the jury instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate applying a de novo standard. State v. Holley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">313 Kan.\n249</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253-54, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">485 P.3d 614</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021).\n\n\nStep One: Kellner Failed to Object to the Jury Instruction at Trial\n\n\n       It is undisputed that Kellner failed to object to the provided jury instruction before\nthe district court. In fact, his attorney stated, &quot;I think that elements of the offense are\nlisted.&quot; Kellner&#x27;s failure to preserve this issue by objecting at trial does not prohibit its\nappellate review but rather changes the review standard. Holley, 313 Kan. at 254. This\n\n                                                   27\n\fcourt reviews the unpreserved claim of jury instruction error for clear error. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 22-3414(3) (&quot;No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an\ninstruction . . . unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its\nverdict . . . unless the instruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly\nerroneous.&quot;). A jury instruction is clearly erroneous if it is legally or factually\ninappropriate and the appellate court is firmly convinced the jury would have reached a\ndifferent verdict if the erroneous instruction had not been given. The party claiming clear\nerror has the burden to show both error and prejudice. State v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">312 Kan. 630</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n639, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">479 P.3d 167</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021).\n\n\nStep Two: The Provided Jury Instruction Was Legally And Factually Appropriate\n\n\n       This court evaluates jury instruction error by determining if it was legally and\nfactually appropriate. An instruction is legally appropriate if it fairly and accurately states\nthe applicable law. State v. Kleypas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">305 Kan. 224</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">382 P.3d 373</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016).

In evaluating whether\nan instruction is factually appropriate, courts must determine whether there was sufficient\nfavorable evidence to the defendant to support the instruction. Holley, 313 Kan. at 255.\n\n\n       The jury instructions were taken from and matched the PIK instruction for\naggravated indecent liberties with a child, including the elements and definition of &quot;lewd\nfondling or touching.&quot; PIK Crim. 4th 55.121. The last paragraph, describing the mens rea\nof intent, was consistent with the culpable mental state instruction in PIK Crim. 4th\n52.010. As was done in this case, the Kansas Supreme Court &quot;&#x27;strongly recommend[s] the\nuse of PIK instructions, which knowledgeable committees develop to bring accuracy,\nclarity, and uniformity to instructions.&#x27;&quot; State v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4270594\"><a href=\"/opinion/4493341/state-v-butler/\">307 Kan. 831</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4270594\"><a href=\"/opinion/4493341/state-v-butler/\">416 P.3d 116</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2018).\n\n\n                                               28\n\f       A &quot;trial court has the duty to inform the jury of every essential element of the\ncrime that is charged&quot; by using the language of the statute or other appropriate and\naccurate language. State v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637722\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637722/state-v-richardson/\">290 Kan. 176</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637722\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637722/state-v-richardson/\">224 P.3d 553</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010). The\njury instruction given matched the PIK and the statutory language of the offense, which\nprovides &quot;[a]ny lewd fondling or touching of the person of either the child or the\noffender, done or submitted to with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of\neither the child or the offender, or both.&quot; K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5506(b)(3)(A). The jury\ninstruction given included each essential element of the crime.\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the phrase &quot;done with&quot; should be considered an essential\nelement of the crime because it connects Kellner&#x27;s intent of arousal or satisfying sexual\ndesire to the act of lewd touching. Although perhaps an interesting intellectual exercise,\nthis argument lacks merit in law and fact. The jury instruction contained the essential\nelement of the act followed by the essential element of the intent. A natural reading of the\ninstruction connects the act with the intent. In fact, if Kellner had merely desired to be\nsexually aroused or satisfy sexual desire, but had not lewdly touched the victim then there\nwould not be sufficient evidence to support a conviction for aggravated indecent liberties\nwith a child. Additionally, the jury instruction explained that &quot;[t]he State must prove that\nthe defendant committed the crime intentionally,&quot; which means the defendant had the\n&quot;desire or conscious objective to do the act&quot; which further connected the act of lewd\ntouching to the required intent.\n\n\n       Kellner also argues that the instruction was factually inappropriate because at trial\nhe argued that his erection occurred before he laid the victim down; that he may have\nbumped against her with his erection; and he later got out of her bed to watch\npornography. So, Kellner apparently attempted to assert that he was aroused and/or\nsatisfied his sexual desire both before and after lewdly touching the victim but the arousal\nand/or sexual desire were wholly unrelated to the intervening lewd touching. He argues,\ntherefore, that inclusion of the was &quot;done with&quot; language would have been factually\n\n                                             29\n\fappropriate because the jury could have found that his lewd touching of the victim was\nnot \u201cdone with\u201d the requisite intent even though he was simultaneously sexually aroused\nand did contemporaneously satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       Kellner attempts to argue on appeal that the instruction could be read to find a\ndefendant guilty after engaging in lewd fondling or touching while contemporaneously\nintending to arouse or satisfy their sexual desires from unrelated acts. Such a\ncircumstance is difficult to imagine and was not presented in this case. The facts of this\ncase readily and easily connected Kellner&#x27;s arousal to his lewd touching of the victim\nbecause Kellner admitted the victim&#x27;s statement to him began his arousal that evening and\nthat he had watched a pornographic video that matched the allegations of his lewd\ntouching. Then, shortly after the lewd touching, he completed the physical release of his\narousal. There are no facts in this case demonstrating that Kellner engaged in lewd\ntouching separate and unrelated to his intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desire.\n\n\n       There are other pattern jury instructions with separate illegal acts and requisite\nintent that use connective language to relate the act and intent. See, e.g., PIK Crim. 4th\n55.090 (2021 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant &quot;touched&quot; the victim, and\nthat &quot;touching was done with the intent&quot; to arouse or satisfy sexual desires); PIK Crim.\n4th 55.181 (2017 Supp.) (requiring the State to prove the defendant possessed a type of\nvisual depiction and &quot;did so&quot; with the requisite intent). While adding the &quot;done with&quot;\nlanguage would have been both legally and factually appropriate, its omission was not\nfactually or legally inappropriate. The aggravated indecent liberties with a child jury\ninstruction, including definitions, naturally connected the essential elements of the act\nand intent even without the &quot;done with&quot; language, which fairly and accurately states the\nlaw and is supported by the case facts. Just because a jury instruction could be better,\nclearer, or more complete does not make it factually or legally inappropriate or\ninaccurate. There was no error.\n\n\n                                             30\n\fStep Three: The Error Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Even assuming an error occurred, Kellner is not entitled to reversal of his\nconviction unless he can show the instruction was clearly erroneous and the jury would\nhave reached a different verdict absent the erroneous instruction. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 22-\n3414(3) (&quot;No party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction . . .\nunless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict . . . unless the\ninstruction or the failure to give an instruction is clearly erroneous.&quot;); Crosby, 312 Kan.\nat 639. Kellner bears this heightened burden because he failed to object to the jury\ninstruction at trial and thus deprived the district court of an opportunity to avoid the\nalleged error and present the jury with an instruction that more clearly connected the act\nwith the intent.\n\n\n       As explained previously, there was ample evidence that Kellner engaged in lewd\nfondling or touching of the victim with the intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desires.\nSeminal fluid consistent with Kellner&#x27;s DNA was found on the victim&#x27;s labia; Kellner\nadmitted to the detective that he rubbed his penis between the victim&#x27;s legs imitating a\nvideo he saw and that he regretted the action; Kellner stated that he became aroused by\nthe victim&#x27;s statement of love which occurred just before he touched her with his penis;\nand the forensic scientist testified that seminal fluid is present in pre-ejaculate or\nejaculate and that &quot;stimulation and release&quot; is needed for seminal fluid to be present.\nKellner presented no evidence that he was not intending to be aroused or satisfy sexual\ndesire when he lewdly touched the victim. His only evidence that his arousal or\nsatisfaction of sexual desire was not related to the lewd touching of the victim is that he\nleft the room before completing his masturbatory act, and perhaps that he wished he was\ntouching his wife when touching the victim.\n\n\n       There is no evidence that convinces this court that the jury would have reached a\ndifferent result had the jury instruction more clearly connected the actus reus: Kellner&#x27;s\n\n                                               31\n\flewd touching of the victim, with the means rea, Kellner&#x27;s intent to arouse or satisfy his\nsexual desire. To be clear, the instruction was not erroneous, and this analysis is provided\nsimply for completeness. But even assuming the provided jury instruction was not legally\nor factually appropriate, it was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nVI.    KELLNER&#x27;S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Kellner asserts that during closing argument, the prosecutor made several &quot;we\nknow&quot; statements, provided his opinion, and misstated the law, cumulatively creating\nreversible error. This court evaluates claims of prosecutorial misconduct in two steps to\ndetermine whether an error occurred and then determining if the identified error\nprejudiced the defendant&#x27;s right to a fair trial. State v. Sherman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">305 Kan. 88</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">378\nP.3d 1060</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016). An error occurs when this court finds that &quot;the prosecutor&#x27;s comments\nfall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors&quot; and offends the defendant&#x27;s rights.\nState v. Alfaro-Valleda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">314 Kan. 526</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502 P.3d 66</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022). If such an error occurred,\nthis court must then determine if that error prejudiced the defendant. 314 Kan. at 538.\nWhen both constitutional and nonconstitutional prosecutorial errors have occurred, an\nappellate court applies the constitutional harmless standard to determine whether the\nState can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of will not or\ndid not affect the outcome of the trial in light of the entire record. Sherman, 305 Kan. at\n100 (citing State v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460345/state-v-ward/\">292 Kan. 541</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl \u00b6 6, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460345/state-v-ward/\">256 P.3d 801</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [2011]).\n\n\nThe Prosecutor&#x27;s &quot;We know&quot; Statements\n\n\n       First, Kellner argues the prosecutor erred in making the following &quot;we know&quot;\nstatements regarding allegedly disputed facts:\n\n\n       1. &quot;So let&#x27;s walk through the timeline. We know how the disclosure happened based on\n          the evidence. This is the evidence of what happened. [The victim] goes to sleep. [The\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f           victim] goes to school. When she gets home from school, [the mom&#x27;s friend] is over\n           there with her mom. And she tells her: &#x27;Daddy touched my butt.&#x27;&quot;\n\n\n       2. &quot;And what do we also know from the DNA? We know that seminal fluid was found\n           on [the victim]. Now you can debate whether you believe that&#x27;s pre-ejaculate or\n           ejaculation. The defendant told Detective Ribble he did not ejaculate. Nevertheless,\n           seminal fluid comes from a male, undisputed. It&#x27;s on [the victim]. That&#x27;s what the\n           evidence shows. The DNA\u2014this man, the defendant.&quot;\n\n\n       3. &quot;And remember, pornography in itself is not the issue here. It&#x27;s not illegal to view it.\n           Adult pornography, it&#x27;s not the issue. It&#x27;s reliving a sexual fantasy with a child that is\n           illegal. That&#x27;s the focus here. And we know from the sperm found in that seminal\n           fluid what he wanted to accomplish, that he had to go elsewhere to finish.&quot;\n\n\n       4. &quot;I will submit to you, the evidence tells you very clearly this wasn&#x27;t a mistake. This\n           wasn&#x27;t an accident. He made a decision. He intended to gratify himself sexually. He\n           may not have completed the entire mission, but that&#x27;s what his intent was when he\n           touched her, and that&#x27;s what the law requires the State to prove.\n\n           &quot;How do we know that? How do you know that? Look at his words again, his\n           consciousness. The struggles he goes through in that interview with Detective\n           Ribble.&quot;\n\n\n       A prosecutor&#x27;s use of &quot;we know&quot; statements in closing argument can lead to error\nwhen those statements are used &quot;in the context of making inferences for the jury because\nthat use convey[s] the prosecutor&#x27;s opinion, which is irrelevant.&quot; Alfaro-Valleda, 314\nKan. at 538. The use of &quot;we know&quot; statements related to disputed or controverted facts or\nto draw conclusions or inferences creates a risk of the prosecutor&#x27;s opinion\u2014even if\nbased on reasonable inference\u2014being presented as evidence to the jury. However, the\n&quot;use of a &#x27;we know&#x27; statement is not prosecutorial error when the evidence being\ndiscussed is not controverted.&quot; 314 Kan. at 538.\n\n\n\n                                                    33\n\f       Although he alleges the prosecutor&#x27;s &quot;we know&quot; statements concerned\ncontroverted facts, Kellner fails to identify how the statements are controverted. The first\n&quot;we know&quot; statement\u2014that &quot;[w]e know how the disclosure happened&quot;\u2014 was an\nuncontroverted fact. The victim&#x27;s mom testified as to the disclosure, and there was no\nevidence to controvert its occurrence. Kellner attempted to elicit testimony from the\nvictim&#x27;s mom that the disclosure was nonchalant but did not contest its occurrence.\n\n\n       The second statement regarding the presence of seminal fluid with DNA matching\nKellner was controverted. Although Kellner did not present his own expert, his attorney\nattempted to elicit testimony from the State&#x27;s expert to draw the DNA and presence of\nseminal fluid into question. Whether Kellner succeeded in drawing the KBI expert&#x27;s\ntestimony into question is a matter of weight for the jury to decide. State v. Burton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7124925\"><a href=\"/opinion/7213064/state-v-burton/\">35\nKan.

Therefore, the prosecutor&#x27;s use of &quot;we know&quot; statements\ndrawing inferences from the DNA evidence\u2014no matter how reasonable\u2014was an error.\n\n\n       The third and fourth statements\u2014regarding evidence of Kellner&#x27;s intent to gratify\nhimself sexually\u2014also referenced a controverted fact. Kellner denied ejaculating or\nleaving seminal fluid on the victim. The prosecutor discussed Kellner&#x27;s demeanor in the\ninterview and his statements from which the jury could infer Kellner&#x27;s intent, which\nexceeds the prosecutor&#x27;s wide latitude. &quot;A prosecutor inferring from evidence and adding\nthat &#x27;we know&#x27; the inference is valid crosses the line by giving the prosecutor&#x27;s opinion\nabout the strength and meaning of the evidence.&quot; Alfaro-Valleda, 314 Kan. at 540.\n\n\n       Three of the &quot;we know&quot; statements Kellner points to constitute error as they\nreferred to controverted facts, but that is not the end of the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\fThe Prosecutor&#x27;s Personal Opinion\n\n\n       Kellner next argues that the prosecutor erroneously inserted his personal opinion\ninto the argument by stating:\n\n\n                &quot;He talks about where he put his penis. The swabs of the DNA show you how\n       lewd it was, because there&#x27;s seminal fluid there. Remember, there&#x27;s bruising. Use your\n       common sense. If rubbing against a little girl for 30 minutes with your erection, is that\n       causing any type of injury? You could say: But it could have been anything. It could have\n       been a bicycle accident. I&#x27;m not going to believe that. The seminal fluid is not from a\n       bicycle accident. It&#x27;s from his penis.&quot;\n\n\nAs Kellner alleges, the prosecutor stating his opinion that the victim&#x27;s labia bruising\ncould not have been caused from a source other than Kellner is prosecutorial error. The\nprosecutor&#x27;s opinion statement goes beyond reciting the evidence to create an inference\nfor the jury to draw, and inappropriately completes the inferential loop. State v. Pribble,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4016070\"><a href=\"/opinion/4238809/state-v-pribble/\">304 Kan. 824</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4016070\"><a href=\"/opinion/4238809/state-v-pribble/\">375 P.3d 966</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016) (arguing the evidence contradicts the\ndefendant&#x27;s testimony is acceptable, but a prosecutor&#x27;s statement that they &quot;don&#x27;t believe&quot;\nthe defendant&#x27;s statement crosses the line).\n\n\nMisstatement of the Law\n\n\n       Kellner next alleges that the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument\nwhen he said:\n                &quot;So this is a question that I submit that you need to answer. Did he lewdly fondle\n       or touch her? What does the evidence show you? This is the instruction, the definition of\n       lewd fondling and touching. It&#x27;s in your packet on both of the counts.\n                &quot;What you don&#x27;t see here is whether it&#x27;s an intentional touching. The intent comes\n       about the sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching? The\n       definition of what the lewd fondling, touching is about, whether the type and manner in\n\n\n                                                   35\n\f       which it occurs would undermine the morals of a child and clearly be offensive to the\n       outrage and moral senses of a reasonable person.&quot;\n\n\nAs with his previous argument regarding the jury instruction, Kellner asserts that because\nthe prosecutor&#x27;s explanation of the charge did not include the phrase &quot;done with&quot;\nconnecting the lewd touching with the arousal or sexual desire intent, the prosecutor&#x27;s\nstatement was an incorrect recitation of the law.\n\n\n       As previously explained, the prosecutor&#x27;s statement of the law was not erroneous.\nFirst, the prosecutor explained the definition of &quot;lewd fondling or touching&quot; by pointing\nto the jury instruction. The prosecutor then explained that Kellner&#x27;s &quot;intent comes about\nthe sexual motivation. What is his motivation by doing the touching?&quot; In making this\nstatement, the prosecutor explained that Kellner&#x27;s intent must be connected to his lewd\ntouching of the victim. This is an accurate statement of the law. See also State v. Dinh\nLoc Ta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923398\"><a href=\"/opinion/7970993/state-v-dinh-loc-ta/\">296 Kan. 230</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242-43, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923398\"><a href=\"/opinion/7970993/state-v-dinh-loc-ta/\">290 P.3d 652</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (both intent and a lewd touch are\nnecessary to commit aggravated indecent liberties with a child, but the intent does not\nmake every touch lewd).\n\n\nPrejudice to Kellner from the Prosecutorial Errors\n\n\n       After finding four of the prosecutor&#x27;s statements constitute error, this court must\ndetermine if the defendant was prejudiced by those errors by determining whether &quot;there\nis no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict.&quot; Sherman, 305 Kan.\nat 109. Kellner argues that the State cannot meet this burden because there is no evidence\nthat his lewd touching was &quot;done with&quot; the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.\n\n\n       The court considered several factors to determine harmlessness, including the\nstrength of the evidence, mitigating factors, the prosecutor&#x27;s statements surrounding the\nerroneous statements, and the strength of the case. See State v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">316 Kan. 154</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n                                                  36\n\f172, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">513 P.3d 1207</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022) (requiring analysis of multiple factors because prejudice may\nbe found even in strong cases). Although the State heavily relies on the overwhelming\nevidence of Kellner&#x27;s guilt, there is other evidence of harmlessness. First, the district\ncourt mitigated potential prejudice to the defendant by instructing the jury prior to closing\nthat the &quot;[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are intended to help you in\nunderstanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they&#x27;re not evidence. If any\nstatements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should be disregarded.&quot;\nThen again, immediately before the prosecutor&#x27;s closing argument the judge said, &quot;[a]nd\nremember . . . that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence.&quot; Such\ninstructions are intended to ensure that jurors understand the attorneys are advocates for\ntheir case, and that their statements do not constitute evidence. Courts assume that jurors\nunderstand and follow these instructions, and this type of instruction can be weighed by\nappellate courts in determining whether a prosecutor&#x27;s erroneous statements were\nharmless to the defendant&#x27;s right to a fair trial. Brown, 316 Kan at 170.\n\n\n       Second, the prosecutor made the erroneous &quot;we know&quot; and opinion statements in\nthe context of discussing the evidence supporting those inferences and opinion. Each\nerroneous statement was made during the prosecutor&#x27;s initial closing argument\u2014which\ncomprised fourteen transcript pages\u2014and were surrounded by statements of\nuncontroverted facts. The prosecutor did not make isolated assertions of opinion, and\nthese erroneous inference statements were based on or supported by the uncontroverted\nfacts of the case. For example, the prosecutor&#x27;s opinion statement about the cause of the\nvictim&#x27;s labia injury was presented with the evidence of Kellner&#x27;s inculpatory statements\nabout his actions, the victim&#x27;s contemporaneous statement, and the DNA evidence.\nMoreover, the jury was free to disagree with and had been instructed to disregard the\nprosecutor&#x27;s opinion statement about the cause of the victim&#x27;s labia injury. This was not a\nrunning theme or repetitive statement but rather an isolated comment within fourteen\npages of argument.\n\n\n                                              37\n\f       Finally, the prosecutor&#x27;s closing argument demonstrated the strength of the\nprosecutor&#x27;s case. Kellner&#x27;s own inculpatory statements made most of the facts\nuncontroverted. The victim very quickly reported Kellner&#x27;s inappropriate touching. The\nvideo that inspired Kellner&#x27;s conduct was located, and the seminal fluid with a DNA\nprofile consistent with Kellner was found on the victim&#x27;s labia. Given the repeated\nmitigating statements from the court, the context of the erroneous statements, the number\nand timing of the erroneous statements in the context of the closing argument, and the\nstrength of the State&#x27;s case, this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there is\nno reasonable possibility that the prosecutor&#x27;s erroneous statements contributed to the\nverdict. See Brown, 316 Kan. at 170-72 (finding no prejudice from the prosecutor&#x27;s &quot;we\nknow&quot; statements surrounded with discussions of the evidence that supported the\nconclusions when the inferences were reasonable and the evidence of guilt strong).\n\n\nVII.   CUMULATIVE ERROR DID NOT DEPRIVE KELLNER OF A FAIR TRIAL\n\n\n       Kellner argues that the prosecutor&#x27;s improper statements during closing and the\nlack of clarity in the jury instruction\u2014even if individually insufficient to require\nreversal\u2014constitute cumulative error that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCumulative trial errors, when considered together, may require reversal of the defendant&#x27;s\nconviction when the totality of the circumstances establish that the defendant was\nsubstantially prejudiced by the errors and denied a fair trial. This court analyzes the\ncumulative effect of errors similarly to its analysis of each individual error by examining\nthe errors and how the judge dealt with the errors as they arose in context; evaluating the\nnature and number of errors and whether they are interrelated; and analyzing the overall\nstrength of the evidence. Just as with the individual errors discussed herein, because some\nof the alleged cumulative errors are constitutional, the State must establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the cumulative effect did not affect the outcome of the trial. Alfaro-\nValleda, 314 Kan. at 551-52. But the cumulative error analysis does not apply unless\n\n\n                                             38\n\fmultiple errors have been found. State v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4253249\"><a href=\"/opinion/4475996/state-v-gonzalez/\">307 Kan. 575</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4253249\"><a href=\"/opinion/4475996/state-v-gonzalez/\">412 P.3d 968</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2018).\n\n\n       Kellner successfully showed error only in the prosecutor&#x27;s statements. Had Kellner\nshown the jury instruction was factually or legally erroneous\u2014even if it were not clearly\nerroneous\u2014then it could still be used to evaluate cumulative error to determine if the\ndefendant was deprived of the right to a fair trial. Because he failed to make such a\nshowing, and this court has already evaluated the cumulative effect of the prosecutorial\nerrors, additional inquiry is unnecessary.\n\n\nVIII. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING KELLNER&#x27;S\nMOTION FOR DISPOSITIONAL AND DURATIONAL DEPARTURE\n\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his\nmotion for departure and instead sentencing him to life imprisonment with a minimum of\n25 years served. Following trial, Kellner moved for dispositional and durational departure\ndue to: (1) his age, (2) his lack of prior criminal history, (3) mitigating circumstances\nincluding his stress, ADHD diagnosis, and addiction which interfered with his normal\nbehavior, (4) his willingness to abide by conditions set by the court including\nparticipating in programs for family preservation, and (5) that there was less harm in this\ncase than normally associated with this type of crime.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the court noted that the presentence investigation report (PSI) did\nnot provide a criminal history score because Kellner&#x27;s crime of conviction was an off-grid\nperson felony. However, because Kellner had filed a motion for departure, the court\nnoted for the record that his history would have been &quot;I,&quot; meaning he had no scorable\nprior convictions pursuant to the grid. At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended\na life sentence with a mandatory 25-year minimum, and argued there was no substantial\nand compelling reason to depart from that statutory sentence. The victim&#x27;s mother\n\n                                             39\n\fprovided a statement and asked the &quot;Court to take into consideration how much this has,\nnot only broken apart my family, but has created a series of kind of lifelong struggles that\nwe have to now deal with because of the actions that Mr. Kellner chose to take on that\nevening.&quot; The victim&#x27;s guardian told the court that the victim wanted it &quot;to know that this\nhas all messed up my family and life since it happened.&quot;\n\n\n       In support of his motion for departure, Kellner&#x27;s attorney argued that the\nlegislature used to leave it to families to resolve these types of inter-family issues, but\nnow &quot;there are situations where the legislature feels that the family needs to be\ncompletely destroyed and an individual sent to prison for essentially the rest of their life.&quot;\nThe attorney suggested that the court could take the opportunity to avoid destroying the\nfamily and instead treat sentencing as an &quot;opportunity to repair and rebuild and\nstrengthen the family&quot; because &quot;this is a case where family preservation appears to be\nwanted by all the parties.&quot; He argued the cost to the State for imprisoning Kellner could\nbe better used, and that with supportive services such as counseling, &quot;[w]e could reunite\nthis family and get them back to a healthy place. And that starts with a dispositional\ndeparture.&quot; The attorney then stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not that big of a risk&quot; to depart because\nKellner would be on lifetime registration and lifetime parole with the underlying threat of\nreturning to prison if he did not follow through. As a result, departing downward and\nreturning back to the grid would be a &quot;win-win situation. It&#x27;s a win for the family; it&#x27;s a\nwin for the State.&quot;\n\n\n       Kellner&#x27;s attorney also argued that Kellner had essentially no prior criminal\nhistory, there were no allegations of vaginal penetration, no allegations of intercourse,\nand no allegations of extensive sexual abuse. Rather, &quot;this is far from the worst situation\nthat any of us have ever listened to evidence on, or been presented in a courtroom.&quot;\nFurther, the attorney stated Kellner was suffering from &quot;some pressure and some stress,\nand so forth, that was involved in the family,&quot; and may have had an addiction to\npornography.\n\n                                              40\n\f       Kellner then provided his own statement to the court. He stated that he was a\nChristian and &quot;[i]n this whole process, I&#x27;ve forgiven everybody in this courtroom\u2014the\njury, my own family, and all my coworkers\u2014anybody I&#x27;ve ever come into contact with\nthat I felt was to blame for the reason why my life went the way it went.&quot; He eventually\nconcluded by stating that &quot;I love my kids. I love my wife, even to this day, and I forgive\nher, whether she forgives me or not.&quot;\n\n\n       Before ruling, the district court stated that &quot;what happened to that six-year-old . . .\nis not a family issue. It has never been a family issue. The legislature and people in the\nstate have never turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children because it happened\nwithin a family.&quot; Further, the court stated, &quot;one could argue that nobody involved in this\ncase needs your forgiveness for anything that happened in this case.&quot;\n\n\n       The court then went on to consider the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented\nwithout weighing them in relation to each other or in relation to any aggravating\ncircumstances. Regarding the evidence presented, the court stated that the DNA analysis\nwas credible and found Kellner&#x27;s sperm on the victim in the place where she disclosed\nKellner touched her; Kellner admitted to something happening; and the alleged event was\nconsistent with the Japanese video Kellner said inspired him. Further, the court noted that\nit could take into consideration evidence which the State declined to present to the jury\u2014\nincluding that Kellner had &quot;websites of little kids dressed up in ballet outfits or\nHalloween costumes or nurse&#x27;s costumes, and things of that nature.&quot;\n\n\n       The court stated that &quot;[w]hether it happens once or twice or twenty or a hundred\ntimes, you don&#x27;t get a pass from molesting a child because it only happened once.&quot; In\nassessing the mitigating circumstances Kellner presented, the court noted his lack of\ncriminal history and allegation that he was under &quot;extreme stress.&quot; The district court\nrecognized that in the interrogation, Kellner spent a lot of time complaining to the officer\n&quot;about how hard your life was, and how unfair things were for you, and things of that\n\n                                              41\n\fnature. None rise to the level of excusing the behavior in which you were convicted of\nhere.&quot; Regarding Kellner&#x27;s argument to preserve the family, the district court stated that it\nunderstood but it &quot;did not get the impression that the family wishes to\u2014has that same\nwish with you as part of it.&quot;\n\n\n       After considering the mitigating circumstances, the court found that there were &quot;no\nsubstantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence in this case.&quot;\nThe district court sentenced Kellner to a term of imprisonment for life, with a mandatory\nminimum term of 25 years; lifetime sex offender registration; and lifetime parole with\nelectronic monitoring. On appeal, this court must determine whether the sentencing court\nabused its discretion in declining to depart, and Kellner bears the burden of\ndemonstrating such abuse of discretion. State v.

Ultimately, the district court stated that it considered\nKellner&#x27;s lack of criminal history, and there is no indication that it failed to consider the\nfactor. The district court is not required to provide a detailed reason for why it determines\nthat each factor is not substantial enough to warrant departure from the statutory\nsentence. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 908 (Explaining that although the sentencing statute\nrequires a judge to explain the reasons for departure the &quot;statute does not oblige a district\ncourt to state its reasons for denying a departure motion.&quot;)\n\n\n       Kellner claims that the district court failed to adequately consider his mental and\nemotional disturbance at the time he committed the crime as a mitigating factor. The\nsentencing court stated that it considered Kellner&#x27;s assertion that the crime was\ncommitted while he was under extreme stress and that Kellner spent a great deal of time\nduring the interrogation talking about his life and why he felt it was unfair. However, the\ncourt then stated these circumstances did not &quot;rise to the level of excusing the behavior in\nwhich you were convicted of here.&quot; Kellner alleges that this statement demonstrates the\n\n                                               43\n\fcourt did not &quot;understand its responsibility to meaningfully consider mitigating\ncircumstances.&quot; The record indicates otherwise. The district court provided extensive\ndetail on its understanding of the process it was required to follow in sentencing Kellner,\nspecifically avoided inappropriately weighing any potential &quot;aggravating circumstances,&quot;\nand stated why it was denying his motion for departure.\n\n\n       Lastly, Kellner argued that the degree of harm caused in this case was less than\nusually associated with a crime of this nature. He argues the incident with the victim was\nbrief and she hardly remembered it; there was no evidence Kellner planned the\nencounter; he did not force the victim to do anything; he did not threaten victim or injure\nher; and did not hold her down and penetrate her vagina with anything including his\npenis. The victim testified clearly to the details of the assault, and her impact statement\nand the mother&#x27;s statements at sentencing show Kellner&#x27;s assault will have a lifetime\nimpact on the victim. Kellner is right that the district court provided no specific comment\nas to this asserted mitigating factor, but it did state that it considered Kellner&#x27;s motion and\noral argument which meets the requirements when denying a departure motion. See\nPowell, 308 Kan. at 908-09.\n\n\n       The district court explained its reasoning and analysis in denying Kellner&#x27;s motion\nfor departure. It appears to have considered each of the argued mitigating factors and did\nnot inappropriately weigh &quot;aggravating circumstances.&quot; The court&#x27;s finding was not based\non an error of law or fact, and it was not arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable. While some\npeople or courts may have found Kellner&#x27;s lack of criminal history and the facts of this\nassault warranted departure, this court cannot say that no reasonable person could take\nthe view adopted by the district court. See Powell, 308 Kan. at 902. &quot;[E]ven though\nmitigating circumstances must be present for a finding of substantial and compelling\nreasons, mitigating circumstances do not necessarily equal substantial and compelling\nreasons&quot; to depart.

The district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner&#x27;s motion for durational and dispositional departure.\n\n                                              44\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Kellner was convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, a heinous\ncrime against a young victim that affected the life of multiple people. Kellner waived his\nrights under Miranda, voluntarily made inculpatory statements during interrogation, and\nwas responsible for nearly all pretrial delays. The evidence supporting his conviction was\nstrong, and although some errors occurred during the trial, none of those individually or\ncumulatively warrant reversal. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Kellner&#x27;s motion for dispositional or durational departure.

Gillett, assistant district attorney, Marc Bennett, district attorney, and Kris W. Kobach,\nattorney general, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore ARNOLD-BURGER, C.J., SCHROEDER and COBLE, JJ.\n\n\n        PER CURIAM: Joseph Newman agreed to plead no contest to two counts of theft,\nwhich would result in a presumptive probation sentence based on his criminal history\nscore. As a condition of probation, the district court ordered him to serve 60 days in the\ncounty jail but explained that the jail term could be reduced if Newman disclosed the\nlocation of the stolen property that had not been recovered. On appeal, Newman argues\nthe 60-day jail sanction must be vacated because the district court improperly punished\nhim for invoking his Fifth Amendment rights at sentencing. Yet because Newman has\nserved his entire sentence, we must dismiss his appeal as moot.\n\n                                                     1\n\f                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       The State charged Newman with two counts of theft and two counts of criminal\nthreat. The charges stemmed from Newman's arrest for stealing a truck, which had about\n$2,500 worth of limestone in the bed, in June 2022. Although officers recovered the truck\nwhen they arrested Newman, they could not locate the limestone.\n\n\n       Newman entered a plea agreement in which he would plead no contest to the two\ncounts of theft and pay restitution in an amount to be determined before sentencing. In\nexchange, the State agreed to recommend the mid number in the appropriate grid box for\nthe charges and that the statutory presumption of probation be imposed. The district court\naccepted Newman's plea and found him guilty after confirming that he fully understood\nthe terms of the agreement.\n\n\n       At sentencing, the parties agreed that Newman's criminal history score was C,\nwhich made this a presumptive probation case. The State recommended the district court\nfollow the terms of the plea agreement by imposing the mid number in the appropriate\ngrid box for each offense. The State also recommended the counts be run concurrent with\neach other and requested restitution of $4,200 payable to Linda Smith. The State\nestimated Newman had been in jail \"around 90 days or so.\" Newman's defense counsel\nagreed that the district court should follow the plea agreement and proffered that the\ncharges resulted from \"frankly, a breakdown in [Newman's] mental health\" and that\nstabilizing Newman's mental health would be \"priority No. 1\" on probation.\n\n\n       After a rather contentious exchange, the details of which are set out below, the\ndistrict court ultimately sentenced Newman to the high number on both counts and ran\nthe counts consecutive for a controlling prison sentence of 20 months. But because it was\na presumptive probation case, the court suspended Newman's sentence for a probation\nterm of 12 months.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The heart of the substantive claim here involves the concerns expressed by Smith\nin both her victim impact statement and in her testimony at sentencing. Smith objected to\nNewman being granted probation until he revealed to whom he sold the limestone\u2014\nalthough there was no evidence that he sold the limestone to anyone. She asserted that the\nlimestone was vintage and could not be replaced.\n\n\n       Counsel for Newman advised the court that Newman \"would decline to make any\nfurther factual admissions today.\" Counsel further explained \"I'm aware Ms. Smith is\nseeking some additional admissions from my client, but we've made the admissions that\nare required to make under the plea agreement, and my client would decline to make any\nfurther admissions to these acts in this case.\" Defense counsel continued to implore the\ncourt to follow the plea agreement and impose probation since the State had no objection.\nDefense counsel reiterated that \"[m]y client is making no further admissions of fact\ntoday, and in addition, Your Honor, we would just simply request that you follow the\nplea agreement. We are agreeing to the number provided for restitution.\"\n\n\n       The district court explained it understood Smith's position and turned to defense\ncounsel, who reiterated that Newman was \"declining to answer further questions, as he\nhas a right to remain silent under the United States Constitution and the Kansas Bill of\nRights, Your Honor.\" The judge added that \"Mr. Newman certainly can't be compelled to\nanswer that question. But I do think that it is extremely distasteful for him to choose to do\nso.\" Smith stated that she agreed. The court explained to Newman that \"if you change\nyour mind about that, you are free to contact law enforcement and provide whatever\ninformation you can that might help them be able to recover that property, which isn't the\nkind of thing that can just be replaced with money.\" When Smith tried to interject again,\nthe court cut her off and ordered as follows:\n\n\n               \"Mr. Newman, I am going to impose a jail sanction as a condition of probation\n       today. I will order, in addition to the other conditions of probation ordered, that you\n\n                                                     3\n\f        spend 60 days in the Sedgwick County Jail without credit for time served. And if you\n        want to continue to stand on your constitutional rights to remain silent, you are free to do\n        so. We don't break people on the rack anymore. But if you are able to provide\n        information to law enforcement that is helpful to them in recovering the property, I will\n        consider whether you need to serve the entirety of that 60-day jail sanction.\"\n\n\n        The judge advised Smith that if Newman \"decides that he wants to get out of jail\non probation before he serves his 60-day jail sanction, he has the option that I just gave\nhim.\"\n\n\n        Defense counsel explained that Newman \"has no information to provide. He has\nno memory of where the limestone is.\" The court remarked that \"a minute ago, he had a\nconstitutional right not to talk. Now, he has no memory.\" Defense counsel countered that\nNewman \"has no memory . . . as this was a massive mental health break he was going\nthrough at the time, he genuinely doesn't know where it is.\" The court noted the response,\nthen asked if there was anything else to put on the record. After clarifying that there was\nno fine imposed and that a payment plan for restitution would be left to the probation\nofficer, the court concluded the hearing. Following the hearing, the court filed a\nsentencing journal entry, which reflected the 60-day probation sanction would \"begin\nimmediately,\" and that it \"could be suspended if defendant discloses the location of the\nlimestone.\"\n\n\n        Two days later, Newman filed a written objection and request for reconsideration\nof the 60-day jail sanction. Newman argued the sanction was imposed in violation of his\nstatutory right to allocution and his constitutional right to remain silent provided under\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. He also contended the probation condition was impermissibly\nvague because the court did not specify which law enforcement agency he should report\nany information to, nor what information the court would find acceptable. The district\ncourt declined to reconsider the 60-day jail sanction in an order filed four days after the\n                                                     4\n\fmotion was filed, noting that oral argument would not materially assist in determining the\nmerits.\n\n\n          Newman timely appealed.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n\n          Newman argues the district court improperly punished him for invoking his right\nto remain silent at sentencing in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But before\naddressing the merits of his argument, this court must first consider the State's claim that\nthe appeal is moot because Newman has served the entire incarceration portion of his\nsentence.\n\n\n          In support of its argument, the State filed a notice of change in custodial status\nfiled under Supreme Court Rule 2.042 (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at 18) on July 13, 2023,\nwhich included the following:\n\n\n             \u2022 A journal entry of probation revocation showing that the district court\n                 revoked Newman's probation on February 16, 2023, and ordered him to\n                 serve a modified prison sentence of 12 months. The journal entry also\n                 reflects that the court awarded jail credit for the time Newman spent in jail\n                 serving the 60-day jail sanction; and\n             \u2022 A letter from the Kansas Department of Corrections stating that Newman\n                 completed his modified prison sentence on June 17, 2023, and that his post-\n                 release supervision would run until at least December 17, 2023.\n\n\n          In a reply brief, Newman challenges the State's mootness claim by first arguing\nthat a previous ruling by this court's motion's panel in June 2023 denying the State's\n                                                 5\n\fmotion to dismiss is now the law of the case. See State v. Collier, 263 Kan. 629, 631-32,\n952 P.2d 1326 (1998) (describing law-of-the-case doctrine as \"'a discretionary policy\nwhich expresses the practice of the courts generally to refuse to reopen a matter already\ndecided, without limiting their power to do so'\"). But contrary to Newman's point, our\ncourt has held that a ruling of the motions panel is not a judgment on the merits of an\nissue but is instead a redirection of the issue to the panel assigned to hear the appeal.\nState v. Cotton, No. 109,934, 2014 WL 4916447, at *1 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished\nopinion) (addressing mootness claim on appeal after motions panel denied identical claim\n\"'on present showing'\"); see also Rock Chalk Hills, LLC v. Sweeney, No. 111,107, 2014\nWL 5801185, at *2 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished opinion) (reviewing jurisdiction and\nmootness issues after motions panel entered order retaining appeal).\n\n\n       Moreover, Newman ignores that the motions panel made its decision solely based\non the information available to it at the time\u2014which was that Newman had merely\nserved the sanction and was still on probation. Yet the documents included with the\nState's most recent notice of change in custodial status reflect that Newman's probation\nhad actually been revoked when the State first moved for a dismissal. And now his\ncustodial status has changed again since Newman is on postrelease supervision. These\nadditional factual developments bear consideration in determining whether the appeal is\nmoot. Put simply, we find the issue of mootness is properly before this court.\n\n\n       Generally, Kansas appellate courts do not decide moot questions or render\nadvisory opinions. State v. Roat, 311 Kan. 581, 590, 466 P.3d 439 (2020). The mootness\ndoctrine is a discretionary policy, under which the court is to determine real controversies\nabout the legal rights of persons and properties that are involved in the case properly\nbefore it and to adjudicate those rights in a way that is operative, final, and conclusive.\n311 Kan. at 590. An issue on appeal will only be dismissed as moot if it can be shown\nclearly and convincingly that the actual controversy has ended, the only judgment that\ncould be entered would be ineffectual for any purpose, and the judgment would not\n\n                                              6\n\fimpact any of the parties' rights. 311 Kan. at 584. A bright-line test, such as a rule that a\nsentencing appeal is moot if the sentence is completed, is contrary to Kansas law. 311\nKan. at 592. In a case like this, the State bears the initial burden of establishing the case is\nmoot by showing that Newman has fully completed the terms of his sentence. 311 Kan. at\n593.\n\n\n       Newman seems to concede that the issue is moot because he does not controvert\nthat he has completed the incarceration portion of his sentence, instead focusing on\narguing exceptions to the mootness doctrine in his reply brief. This court can accept the\nfilings included with the State's notice as reliable evidence confirming his custodial\nstatus. See State v. Yazell, No. 116,761, 2021 WL 402078, at *3 (Kan. App.)\n(unpublished opinion) (relying on signed sworn certification from KDOC records\ncustodian to support prima facie showing of the defendant's custodial status), rev. denied\n314 Kan. 859 (2021). Moreover, the documentation provided by the State shows the\ndistrict court modified his sentence substantially when it revoked his probation\u2014\nreducing the total prison term from 20 months to 12 months\u2014and awarded jail credit for\ntime served, including the time served for the 60-day jail sanction. These added facts\nunderscore the State's point that the appeal is moot because any judgment in Newman's\nfavor would be of no use to him.\n\n\n       A common exception to mootness is a finding that an issue \"'is capable of\nrepetition and raises concerns of public importance.'\" (Emphasis added.) State v. Kinder,\n307 Kan. 237, 244, 408 P.3d 114 (2018) (quoting State v. Hilton, 295 Kan. 845, 850, 286\nP.3d 871 [2012]). Newman, who bears the burden of proof, argues that this exception\nshould apply. See Roat, 311 Kan. at 593 (once mootness established, the burden shifts to\nnonmoving party to establish an exception).\n\n\n       Kansas courts have addressed whether an issue is capable of repetition by\nconsidering whether it is highly unlikely that anyone in the appellant's circumstance\n\n                                               7\n\fcould have obtained relief on appeal before the issue became moot. See Hilton, 295 Kan.\nat 851. On this point, Newman points out that the documentation provided by the State\nshows he completed serving the 60-day jail term before the record on appeal was\ncomplete and before appellate counsel even filed a brief. These assertions\u2014while correct\nand supported by the record\u2014are case-specific. Even so, Newman's broader point is\nconvincing because there is a real possibility that the issue presented here would evade\nreview given the time can lapse between a defendant's placement on probation and the\nresolution of an appeal.\n\n\n       Next, Newman asserts this is an issue of public importance because it concerns a\nfundamental right: the right to remain silent protected by the Fifth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But\npublic importance means more than that certain members of the general public are\ninterested in the decision of the appeal from motives of curiosity or because it may bear\nupon their individual rights or serve as a guide for their future conduct. Hilton, 295 Kan.\nat 851. Kansas courts will determine a moot question of public importance if the value of\nits determination as precedent is enough to overcome the rule against considering moot\nquestions. State ex rel. Stephan v. Johnson, 248 Kan. 286, 290, 807 P.2d 664 (1991).\n\n\n       This court has declined to apply this mootness exception where the atypical facts\nof the case suggest no public importance would be served by considering the merits. See\nState v. Burd, No. 114,398, 2016 WL 3856306, at *3 (Kan. App. 2016) (unpublished\nopinion); State v. Nicolaides, No. 114,239, 2016 WL 3856612, at *3 (Kan. App. 2016)\n(unpublished opinion). Burd and Nicolaides involved identical challenges by the\ndefendants claiming the district court erred by imposing their underlying sentence after\nrevoking probation instead of an intermediate sanction. In both cases, this court found the\nissue moot and declined to apply an exception because the facts of the cases were not\nfactually typical, and any precedential value of a decision on the merits would be\nminimal.\n\n                                             8\n\f       On the other hand, this court applied the exception Newman seeks to invoke in a\ncase involving a 60-day jail sanction ordered as a probation condition. See State v. Allen,\n55 Kan. App. 2d 87, 91, 407 P.3d 661 (2017). Allen is distinguishable, however, because\nthe issue raised in that case concerned whether the district court lacked the authority to\nimpose consecutive jail sanctions across two cases because of a statute requiring that the\nsanctions be served concurrently. Here, Newman does not challenge the district court's\nstatutory authority to order a 60-day jail sanction, but the constitutionality of the district\ncourt's action. As in Burd and Nicolaides, Newman does not articulate why his appeal is\nfactually typical to present an issue of public importance or describe how a determination\non the merits would create valuable precedent. As a result, we find the mootness\nexception for issues raising concerns of public importance inapplicable here.\n\n\n       In sum, we find Newman's appeal is moot because he has served the entire\nincarceration portion of his sentence and he establishes no mootness exception.\n\n\n       Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                           NOT DESIGNATED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n                                              No. 125,830\n\n               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                          STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                              Appellee,\n\n                                                     v.\n\n                                           JOSEPH NEWMAN,\n                                              Appellant.\n\n\n                                    MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; SETH L.

The State\nestimated Newman had been in jail &quot;around 90 days or so.&quot; Newman&#x27;s defense counsel\nagreed that the district court should follow the plea agreement and proffered that the\ncharges resulted from &quot;frankly, a breakdown in [Newman&#x27;s] mental health&quot; and that\nstabilizing Newman&#x27;s mental health would be &quot;priority No. 1&quot; on probation.\n\n\n       After a rather contentious exchange, the details of which are set out below, the\ndistrict court ultimately sentenced Newman to the high number on both counts and ran\nthe counts consecutive for a controlling prison sentence of 20 months. But because it was\na presumptive probation case, the court suspended Newman&#x27;s sentence for a probation\nterm of 12 months.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The heart of the substantive claim here involves the concerns expressed by Smith\nin both her victim impact statement and in her testimony at sentencing. Smith objected to\nNewman being granted probation until he revealed to whom he sold the limestone\u2014\nalthough there was no evidence that he sold the limestone to anyone. She asserted that the\nlimestone was vintage and could not be replaced.\n\n\n       Counsel for Newman advised the court that Newman &quot;would decline to make any\nfurther factual admissions today.&quot; Counsel further explained &quot;I&#x27;m aware Ms. Smith is\nseeking some additional admissions from my client, but we&#x27;ve made the admissions that\nare required to make under the plea agreement, and my client would decline to make any\nfurther admissions to these acts in this case.&quot; Defense counsel continued to implore the\ncourt to follow the plea agreement and impose probation since the State had no objection.\nDefense counsel reiterated that &quot;[m]y client is making no further admissions of fact\ntoday, and in addition, Your Honor, we would just simply request that you follow the\nplea agreement. We are agreeing to the number provided for restitution.&quot;\n\n\n       The district court explained it understood Smith&#x27;s position and turned to defense\ncounsel, who reiterated that Newman was &quot;declining to answer further questions, as he\nhas a right to remain silent under the United States Constitution and the Kansas Bill of\nRights, Your Honor.&quot; The judge added that &quot;Mr. Newman certainly can&#x27;t be compelled to\nanswer that question. But I do think that it is extremely distasteful for him to choose to do\nso.&quot; Smith stated that she agreed. The court explained to Newman that &quot;if you change\nyour mind about that, you are free to contact law enforcement and provide whatever\ninformation you can that might help them be able to recover that property, which isn&#x27;t the\nkind of thing that can just be replaced with money.&quot; When Smith tried to interject again,\nthe court cut her off and ordered as follows:\n\n\n               &quot;Mr. Newman, I am going to impose a jail sanction as a condition of probation\n       today. I will order, in addition to the other conditions of probation ordered, that you\n\n                                                     3\n\f        spend 60 days in the Sedgwick County Jail without credit for time served. And if you\n        want to continue to stand on your constitutional rights to remain silent, you are free to do\n        so. We don&#x27;t break people on the rack anymore. But if you are able to provide\n        information to law enforcement that is helpful to them in recovering the property, I will\n        consider whether you need to serve the entirety of that 60-day jail sanction.&quot;\n\n\n        The judge advised Smith that if Newman &quot;decides that he wants to get out of jail\non probation before he serves his 60-day jail sanction, he has the option that I just gave\nhim.&quot;\n\n\n        Defense counsel explained that Newman &quot;has no information to provide. He has\nno memory of where the limestone is.&quot; The court remarked that &quot;a minute ago, he had a\nconstitutional right not to talk. Now, he has no memory.&quot; Defense counsel countered that\nNewman &quot;has no memory . . . as this was a massive mental health break he was going\nthrough at the time, he genuinely doesn&#x27;t know where it is.&quot; The court noted the response,\nthen asked if there was anything else to put on the record. After clarifying that there was\nno fine imposed and that a payment plan for restitution would be left to the probation\nofficer, the court concluded the hearing. Following the hearing, the court filed a\nsentencing journal entry, which reflected the 60-day probation sanction would &quot;begin\nimmediately,&quot; and that it &quot;could be suspended if defendant discloses the location of the\nlimestone.&quot;\n\n\n        Two days later, Newman filed a written objection and request for reconsideration\nof the 60-day jail sanction. Newman argued the sanction was imposed in violation of his\nstatutory right to allocution and his constitutional right to remain silent provided under\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. He also contended the probation condition was impermissibly\nvague because the court did not specify which law enforcement agency he should report\nany information to, nor what information the court would find acceptable. The district\ncourt declined to reconsider the 60-day jail sanction in an order filed four days after the\n                                                     4\n\fmotion was filed, noting that oral argument would not materially assist in determining the\nmerits.\n\n\n          Newman timely appealed.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n\n          Newman argues the district court improperly punished him for invoking his right\nto remain silent at sentencing in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But before\naddressing the merits of his argument, this court must first consider the State&#x27;s claim that\nthe appeal is moot because Newman has served the entire incarceration portion of his\nsentence.\n\n\n          In support of its argument, the State filed a notice of change in custodial status\nfiled under Supreme Court Rule 2.042 (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at 18) on July 13, 2023,\nwhich included the following:\n\n\n             \u2022 A journal entry of probation revocation showing that the district court\n                 revoked Newman&#x27;s probation on February 16, 2023, and ordered him to\n                 serve a modified prison sentence of 12 months. The journal entry also\n                 reflects that the court awarded jail credit for the time Newman spent in jail\n                 serving the 60-day jail sanction; and\n             \u2022 A letter from the Kansas Department of Corrections stating that Newman\n                 completed his modified prison sentence on June 17, 2023, and that his post-\n                 release supervision would run until at least December 17, 2023.\n\n\n          In a reply brief, Newman challenges the State&#x27;s mootness claim by first arguing\nthat a previous ruling by this court&#x27;s motion&#x27;s panel in June 2023 denying the State&#x27;s\n                                                 5\n\fmotion to dismiss is now the law of the case. See State v. Collier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186267/state-v-collier/\">263 Kan. 629</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631-32,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186267/state-v-collier/\">952 P.2d 1326</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998) (describing law-of-the-case doctrine as &quot;&#x27;a discretionary policy\nwhich expresses the practice of the courts generally to refuse to reopen a matter already\ndecided, without limiting their power to do so&#x27;&quot;). But contrary to Newman&#x27;s point, our\ncourt has held that a ruling of the motions panel is not a judgment on the merits of an\nissue but is instead a redirection of the issue to the panel assigned to hear the appeal.\nState v. Cotton, No. 109,934, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2014 WL 4916447</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished\nopinion) (addressing mootness claim on appeal after motions panel denied identical claim\n&quot;&#x27;on present showing&#x27;&quot;); see also Rock Chalk Hills, LLC v. Sweeney, No. 111,107, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2014\nWL 5801185</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished opinion) (reviewing jurisdiction and\nmootness issues after motions panel entered order retaining appeal).\n\n\n       Moreover, Newman ignores that the motions panel made its decision solely based\non the information available to it at the time\u2014which was that Newman had merely\nserved the sanction and was still on probation. Yet the documents included with the\nState&#x27;s most recent notice of change in custodial status reflect that Newman&#x27;s probation\nhad actually been revoked when the State first moved for a dismissal. And now his\ncustodial status has changed again since Newman is on postrelease supervision. These\nadditional factual developments bear consideration in determining whether the appeal is\nmoot. Put simply, we find the issue of mootness is properly before this court.\n\n\n       Generally, Kansas appellate courts do not decide moot questions or render\nadvisory opinions. State v. Roat, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">311 Kan. 581</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">466 P.3d 439</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2020). The mootness\ndoctrine is a discretionary policy, under which the court is to determine real controversies\nabout the legal rights of persons and properties that are involved in the case properly\nbefore it and to adjudicate those rights in a way that is operative, final, and conclusive.\n311 Kan. at 590. An issue on appeal will only be dismissed as moot if it can be shown\nclearly and convincingly that the actual controversy has ended, the only judgment that\ncould be entered would be ineffectual for any purpose, and the judgment would not\n\n                                              6\n\fimpact any of the parties&#x27; rights. 311 Kan. at 584. A bright-line test, such as a rule that a\nsentencing appeal is moot if the sentence is completed, is contrary to Kansas law. 311\nKan. at 592. In a case like this, the State bears the initial burden of establishing the case is\nmoot by showing that Newman has fully completed the terms of his sentence. 311 Kan. at\n593.\n\n\n       Newman seems to concede that the issue is moot because he does not controvert\nthat he has completed the incarceration portion of his sentence, instead focusing on\narguing exceptions to the mootness doctrine in his reply brief. This court can accept the\nfilings included with the State&#x27;s notice as reliable evidence confirming his custodial\nstatus. See State v. Yazell, No. 116,761, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 402078</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Kan. App.)\n(unpublished opinion) (relying on signed sworn certification from KDOC records\ncustodian to support prima facie showing of the defendant&#x27;s custodial status), rev. denied\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">314 Kan. 859</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021). Moreover, the documentation provided by the State shows the\ndistrict court modified his sentence substantially when it revoked his probation\u2014\nreducing the total prison term from 20 months to 12 months\u2014and awarded jail credit for\ntime served, including the time served for the 60-day jail sanction. These added facts\nunderscore the State&#x27;s point that the appeal is moot because any judgment in Newman&#x27;s\nfavor would be of no use to him.\n\n\n       A common exception to mootness is a finding that an issue &quot;&#x27;is capable of\nrepetition and raises concerns of public importance.&#x27;&quot; (Emphasis added.) State v. Kinder,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">307 Kan. 237</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">408 P.3d 114</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018) (quoting State v.

Newman, who bears the burden of proof, argues that this exception\nshould apply. See Roat, 311 Kan. at 593 (once mootness established, the burden shifts to\nnonmoving party to establish an exception).\n\n\n       Kansas courts have addressed whether an issue is capable of repetition by\nconsidering whether it is highly unlikely that anyone in the appellant&#x27;s circumstance\n\n                                               7\n\fcould have obtained relief on appeal before the issue became moot. See Hilton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923354\"><a href=\"/opinion/7970953/state-v-hilton/\">295 Kan.\nat 851</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. On this point, Newman points out that the documentation provided by the State\nshows he completed serving the 60-day jail term before the record on appeal was\ncomplete and before appellate counsel even filed a brief. These assertions\u2014while correct\nand supported by the record\u2014are case-specific. Even so, Newman&#x27;s broader point is\nconvincing because there is a real possibility that the issue presented here would evade\nreview given the time can lapse between a defendant&#x27;s placement on probation and the\nresolution of an appeal.\n\n\n       Next, Newman asserts this is an issue of public importance because it concerns a\nfundamental right: the right to remain silent protected by the Fifth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. But\npublic importance means more than that certain members of the general public are\ninterested in the decision of the appeal from motives of curiosity or because it may bear\nupon their individual rights or serve as a guide for their future conduct.

Kansas courts will determine a moot question of public importance if the value of\nits determination as precedent is enough to overcome the rule against considering moot\nquestions. State ex rel. Stephan v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454393/state-ex-rel-stephan-v-johnson/\">248 Kan. 286</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454393/state-ex-rel-stephan-v-johnson/\">807 P.2d 664</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).\n\n\n       This court has declined to apply this mootness exception where the atypical facts\nof the case suggest no public importance would be served by considering the merits. See\nState v. Burd, No. 114,398, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2016 WL 3856306</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Kan. App. 2016) (unpublished\nopinion); State v.

Burd and Nicolaides involved identical challenges by the\ndefendants claiming the district court erred by imposing their underlying sentence after\nrevoking probation instead of an intermediate sanction. In both cases, this court found the\nissue moot and declined to apply an exception because the facts of the cases were not\nfactually typical, and any precedential value of a decision on the merits would be\nminimal.\n\n                                             8\n\f       On the other hand, this court applied the exception Newman seeks to invoke in a\ncase involving a 60-day jail sanction ordered as a probation condition. See State v. Allen,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">55 Kan. App. 2d 87</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">407 P.3d 661</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2017). Allen is distinguishable, however, because\nthe issue raised in that case concerned whether the district court lacked the authority to\nimpose consecutive jail sanctions across two cases because of a statute requiring that the\nsanctions be served concurrently. Here, Newman does not challenge the district court&#x27;s\nstatutory authority to order a 60-day jail sanction, but the constitutionality of the district\ncourt&#x27;s action. As in Burd and Nicolaides, Newman does not articulate why his appeal is\nfactually typical to present an issue of public importance or describe how a determination\non the merits would create valuable precedent. As a result, we find the mootness\nexception for issues raising concerns of public importance inapplicable here.\n\n\n       In sum, we find Newman&#x27;s appeal is moot because he has served the entire\nincarceration portion of his sentence and he establishes no mootness exception.\n\n\n       Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1186267/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1454393/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923354/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925370/", "id": 9925370, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467532/state-v-flack/", "cluster_id": 9467532, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467532/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:04:55.950450-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:30:58.745105-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "068712af12caeaa442f15b99e5ca1efce25c2f7b", "page_count": 87, "download_url": "https://www.kscourts.org/KSCourts/media/KsCourts/Opinions/115964.pdf?ext=.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/state_v._flack.pdf", "plain_text": "                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                       No. 115,964\n\n                                    STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                        Appellee,\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                  KYLE TREVOR FLACK,\n                                       Appellant.\n\n\n                             SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n1.\n       When the facts material to a decision on a motion to suppress evidence are not in\ndispute, the inquiry on appeal becomes a question of law.\n\n\n2.\n       Whether a defendant's repeated statements during a custodial interview to \"[t]ake\nme to jail\" constitute an unambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent depends on\ntheir context.\n\n\n3.\n       The ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in\nDeath Penalty Cases are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim in a capital case, but they are not coextensive with constitutional\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f4.\n        Appellate courts review continuance denials for abuse of discretion.

In a separate proceeding, it\nsentenced him to death after finding two aggravating factors that were not outweighed by\nmitigating circumstances. On direct appeal, Flack raises numerous issues. We affirm his\nconvictions and the sentence.\n\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       In 2013, Andrew Stout and two friends, including Steven White, lived at Stout's\nhouse in rural Franklin County. Flack, another friend of Stout's, occasionally spent time\nthere. Flack brought a shotgun with him everywhere, usually keeping it in a black duffel\nbag, and even slept with it nearby. Stout was dating K.B. and intended for the friends to\nmove out by May 1, so she and her 18-month-old daughter, L.B., could move in.\n\n\n       After not hearing from Stout, on May 6, some concerned friends went to his home\nto look for him. While checking an outbuilding near the house, they discovered a body\nunder a tarp, later identified as White. They called 911. Investigators found two more\nbodies in the house, later identified as Stout and K.B. The investigators suspected Flack,\nwho they located in Emporia at a friend's apartment. Officers arrested him shortly after\nmidnight on May 8, and read him his Miranda rights. They searched the Emporia\napartment, finding a black duffel bag. It contained a shotgun cleaning kit, a roll of duct\ntape, and zip ties.\n\n\n       Flack provided his versions of events to detectives twice after his arrest. His story\nevolved during those interviews. The first started around 3:30 a.m. on May 8 in Emporia.\nBy that time, officers had identified White's body in the outbuilding but not the two in the\nmaster bedroom. They considered L.B., the child, to be missing.\n                                          3\n\fFirst interview\n\n       In what the State depicts as Flack's first of eight versions of events, he claimed to\nlast see Stout, K.B., and L.B. on April 27 at Stout's house. He said Stout and K.B.\nplanned to go bowling after Flack and Stout bought cigarettes. Flack claimed they\nseparated in Pomona, where his friend, Kenneth Douglas, picked him up and drove him\nto Emporia.\n\n\n       As details emerged, so did inconsistencies. Flack said he and Stout went to Ottawa\nbefore Pomona. Stout dropped him off at the Pomona Dollar General, and Flack then\nwent to a nearby cemetery with two women, who later took him to Ottawa. From there,\nhis stepbrother picked him up, and he slept on the stepbrother's couch that night. He did\nnothing the next day, April 28, other than walk around Pomona.\n\n\n       Then, Flack said he went to Emporia on April 29. But before going, his stepfather\ndropped him off at Stout's house, where he played video games for a half hour. At that\ntime, some people stopped by looking for Stout. The stepfather returned and took him to\nthe Pomona Dollar General, where Douglas picked him up to go to Emporia. Flack said\nhe stayed with Douglas while there, and he bought a new cellphone after Douglas' kids\nbroke his old one. He later changed that story, saying he broke the phone himself. He\nacknowledged speaking to Stout's mother by both phone and text during this time.\n\n\n       Without prompting, Flack mentioned his shotgun, claiming Stout kept Flack's\n1300 Remington in his bedroom closet. He also mentioned buying \"PDX Defender\"\nshotgun shells from Wal-Mart a few months earlier.\n\n\n       Flack also claimed Stout sold marijuana, and every resident at Stout's house used\ndrugs. When describing White, he said White brought \"tweakers\" (methamphetamine\n\n                                              4\n\fusers) to Stout's and that made Stout nervous. The last time Flack saw him, White \"was\nfuckin' out of his mind, like been up too long, like you could see his eyes all fucking\nblack and sunk in.\" Flack got along with White, but he would not call him his \"best\nfriend.\"\n\n\n       Flack's second version began after Detective Tammy Alexander confronted him\nwith other witness statements. She told Flack that Douglas denied his kids broke the\nphone and said he picked up Flack in Emporia, not Pomona. Alexander told Flack the\nvictims were shot with a shotgun, and that \"Defender\" shotgun shells were at the scene;\nshe noted K.B.'s car was found in Emporia, where Flack had been.\n\n\n       Flack eventually said he was in Emporia to sell drugs. He sold \"dope\"\n(methamphetamine) to a group of Mexicans known as the South Side Lobos. He also\nclaimed to work for \"Omar,\" a bald-headed Mexican with a 13 tattooed on his chest,\nwhom he had met in prison. Omar, in turn, introduced Stout to \"Chewie,\" so Chewie\ncould supply Stout with marijuana for dealing. Omar drove him to Emporia, and from\nthere Douglas picked him up. Flack appeared to be explaining why he lied about the\nplace where he met Douglas and attempting to align his story with Douglas'.\n\n\n       Flack then mentioned going to Stout's on April 29 or 30. Finding the door locked\nand no one home, he walked to the outbuilding, where he noticed something unnatural\nbecause the dog's bowl was outside and windows left open. In the outbuilding, he saw a\nfoot hanging out from a tarp. Not knowing what to do, he left the residence.\n\n\n       The conversation returned to Omar, Chewie, and Flack's Emporia business. He\ndescribed delivering drugs for Omar right after being dropped off in Emporia. He said\nOmar gave him a car, telling him he could use it if needed. Seeing the car's license plate,\nFlack told Alexander that in \"[t]hat moment I knew it was my ass,\" because he realized it\n                                            5\n\fwas K.B.'s car. Even though he did not think it could be proven and did not know why\nOmar would want to kill Stout, he said, \"I guess they did it, but I don't know.\"\n\n\n       During questioning, Alexander showed Flack a mugshot and asked if he knew the\nperson. His answer was unclear. Alexander later testified the photo was of a long-\ndeceased person named Omar who had been arrested in Emporia but had never been in\nthe Hutchison prison while Flack was there. At the end of the Emporia interview,\nAlexander asked what happened to L.B. Flack told her \"they . . . took the kid,\" and \"the\ndude could be a child molester.\" Officers then transported Flack to Ottawa, where he\nrested and ate.\n\n\nSecond interview\n\n       The next day in Ottawa, Flack's interview began his third version. In this iteration,\nhe claimed Omar and Chewie killed Stout and K.B. while Flack was at the house. He did\nnot see L.B. that day. The murders happened a day or two before the people stopped by\nStout's and found Flack at the house alone.\n\n\n       On the day of the murders, Flack went to Stout's with Omar and Chewie, who\nwent in, while he stayed outside. Upon hearing a gunshot, he became frightened and fled.\nFlack saw Omar and Chewie carry duffel bags from the house. Flack contacted his\nstepfather for transportation. Flack spent time in Ottawa and Pomona before going back\nto Stout's, getting K.B.'s car, and driving it to Emporia.\n\n\n       Later in the interview, Flack's fourth version emerged, placing himself inside the\nhouse during the murders. According to this account, Omar, Chewie, and Flack were at\nStout's because Stout owed Omar money. All three went into the house, and, once inside,\nOmar and Chewie entered Stout's bedroom with Stout and shut the door. Flack heard two\n\n                                              6\n\fgunshots and ran out. Outside, he heard additional gunfire. Seeking cover under the front\nporch, he witnessed Omar leaving with drugs and a shotgun. After Omar and Chewie left,\nFlack discovered Stout's lifeless body in the bedroom under a pile of clothes. He then\ntook K.B.'s keys from her purse, walked to the outbuilding, and noticed another body\nunder a tarp. He took K.B.'s car to Ottawa, called Douglas to plan to visit Emporia, and\ndrove K.B.'s car to Emporia a day or two later.\n\n\n       Up to this point, Flack had not described White's death. That changed with his\nfifth version, in which he claimed a \"skinny Mexican\" killed White. Based on this\nversion, the day White died, he met with Omar, Chewie, and the Mexican in Ottawa and\nthey all drove to Stout's. Omar and the Mexican went inside where Stout, K.B., and\nWhite were. Flack and Chewie stayed outside. When Omar and the other man came back\noutside, everything seemed fine. Flack thought they would leave, but Omar asked about\nguns. Flack brought his shotgun outside, and the group took turns shooting it. White\ncame out and joined in.\n\n\n       After White fired the gun, he handed it to the Mexican. While the others chatted,\nWhite and the Mexican went to the outbuilding. Flack heard a gunshot. The Mexican\ncame out and went into the house with Chewie. Three more gunshots were fired. The two\nmen came back out with a duffel bag, keys, and a wallet. They then drove back to\nOttawa, leaving Flack with K.B.'s car. Omar told him to get rid of the car.\n\n\n       In his sixth version, Flack told detectives he and Stout shot White in mid-April. He\nclaimed Stout and White argued one day about White living there rent-free. Later that\nevening, Stout told Flack he did not know what to do about White. Flack told him, \"[J]ust\nshoot him.\" Stout replied, \"[I]f I do that[,] I'll have to bury him.\" Flack told Detective\nJeremi Thompson, \"[T]hat's when the joking stopped.\" The next day, Flack and Stout\n\n\n                                              7\n\fdiscussed the situation again. Responding to Stout's worry, Flack told him to \"just do\nwhatever you need to do\" and that he had Stout's \"back.\"\n\n\n       Not long after that, Stout asked White if he had gotten a job yet, which led to more\nbickering. White went outside. Stout grabbed Flack's shotgun, and he and Flack followed\nWhite. Stout shot White, who was in front of a car in the outbuilding. Stout gave Flack\nthe shotgun. Flack shot White again, which killed him. After hiding the body under a\ntarp, the two went inside the house and pondered next steps while smoking marijuana.\n\n\n       Flack's seventh version addressed Stout's murder. Flack said after White's murder,\nhe got paranoid. He called Omar to see if Omar could help him leave the area. Omar\nagreed but insisted on Stout returning the fronted drugs and money first. As a result,\nOmar and Chewie came to Stout's to settle up. Once there, Omar and Stout began\narguing. Eventually, Omar shot Stout twice in the back. Flack claimed Omar shot Stout\ntwo more times and then beat him with the shotgun. During the shooting, K.B. laid on the\nbed with her hands tied behind her back.\n\n\n       Either Omar or Chewie\u2014Flack could not remember who\u2014thought Flack looked\nstressed by what had happened, so they gave him money to buy marijuana. When he\ncame back, Flack found Stout dead under the clothing pile. He told the detectives Omar\ngave him the shotgun and said to get rid of it. He said he broke it down and threw it into a\ndumpster in Emporia.\n\n\n       In his eighth version, Flack described what happened to K.B. and L.B. When\nOmar killed Stout, K.B. tried to run out of the room. Chewie told Flack to grab her, so he\ndid. Flack found zip ties in his bag, and Chewie gave him a bandana to silence K.B.\nMeanwhile, L.B. entered the room. Chewie took K.B. to the living room, where he raped\nher.\n                                             8\n\f       Afterward, Chewie brought K.B. back to the bedroom and forced her to lie face\ndown on the floor. He shot K.B. with the shotgun. Chewie rolled her over next to Stout.\nHe and Omar started throwing clothes on the bodies. Then L.B. walked toward her\nmother. Chewie shot L.B. in the back and put her into a small suitcase he found in the\nbedroom. Omar and Chewie took the suitcase, drugs, and money to the car and left. They\ntold Flack it was \"his problem\" to get rid of K.B.'s car and the shotgun. Sitting on the\nporch, he called his brother to figure out whether to call the police or run. He drove to\nEmporia and stayed with Douglas for a few days.\n\n\n       The interview ended when Flack requested an attorney.\n\n\nPost-interview investigation\n\n       Investigators followed up on Flack's claims he met \"Omar\" in prison. They\nreviewed lists of inmates overlapping his time in prison, producing a few leads, but none\nwere \"Omar.\" They also reviewed his phone records, identifying most calls and who was\non the other end. No calls were connected to \"Omar\" or \"Chewie.\"\n\n\n       Emporia's city recycling center found a shotgun receiver and magazine in the trash\nand notified police. Forensic testing showed they were from the same gun that fired the\nshotgun shells discovered at Stout's.\n\n\n       On May 11, an Osage County sheriff's deputy found debris on a creek bank that\nled to locating L.B.'s body, which was contained in a partially submerged black suitcase.\n\n\n       Cell tower data for Flack's phone established that from May 1 until the morning of\nMay 3, his phone did not move from the general area of Stout's house. Around 10:40\n\n                                             9\n\fa.m., May 3, there was a single call attributed to his phone that registered on two towers,\nshowing Flack was about a mile-and-a-half from where police found L.B.'s body. Later\non May 3, the phone began using towers around Emporia. While there, Flack bought a\nnew phone, and the data showed him moving around Emporia on May 6 and May 7.\n\n\n       In mid-August, Flack's mother met him in jail, and the visit was recorded. Flack\ntold his mother, \"I'm gonna end up gettin' a lotta time outta this\" and \"I'm not guilty of all\nof it but I'm guilty.\" Flack also revealed he lied to police: \"[D]own the line they're gonna\nask me questions like . . . who else was involved . . . . And unfortunately . . . they didn't\nbelieve my fuckin' story. I tried tellin' 'em . . . some bullshit but they didn't\u2014uh, they\nalready had so much evidence I guess.\"\n\n\nCriminal proceedings\n\n       The State charged Flack with the capital murder of K.B. and L.B. in the same\ncourse of conduct, first-degree murder of Stout, first-degree murder of White, criminal\npossession of a firearm, and misdemeanor sexual battery of K.B. At arraignment, the\nState filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty based on five aggravators: (1)\nFlack was previously convicted of attempted second-degree murder; (2) he knowingly or\npurposefully killed more than one person; (3) he committed the crime to avoid or prevent\nlawful arrest or prosecution; (4) he killed K.B. in an especially heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel manner; and (5) he killed K.B. as a potential witness against him.\n\n\n       During the trial's guilt phase, the State's evidence included what is outlined above.\nIts theory was that the murders occurred in large part as Flack described, but it was he,\nrather than \"Omar\" or \"Chewie,\" who performed the acts. Flack did not testify. The jury\nfound him guilty on all counts except misdemeanor sexual battery. The court accepted the\n\n\n                                              10\n\fverdicts, and the State moved for a separate sentencing proceeding for the jury to\ndetermine whether to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n       During the penalty phase, the State relied on its guilt-phase evidence, as well as\nadditional evidence. To show K.B. suffered additional mental anguish from being unable\nto see, as she was not wearing her glasses at the time of her murder, the State presented\ntestimony\u2014showing K.B. always needed glasses to see\u2014and surveillance footage of\nK.B. wearing glasses on the presumed date of her death. The State also introduced\nevidence demonstrating Flack's previous conviction for attempted second-degree murder,\nalong with the journal entry for his previous conviction.\n\n\n       In mitigation, Flack again did not testify, instead presenting several witnesses,\nincluding an expert on how prisoners might acclimate to prison life; a prison work\nsupervisor whom Flack successfully worked with in prison; Flack's parole officer, who\nknew of no violations he committed since being paroled; and a supervisor at Ottawa\nSanitation, who described Flack as a good employee. He also presented evidence\nshowing Flack's horrific childhood of neglect and abuse. His friends and family testified\nhow their lives would be affected if Flack were to receive a death sentence.\n\n\n       Other witnesses\u2014many of whom were experts in mental illness and its\ntreatment\u2014testified about Flack's mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety,\nand hallucinations. His diagnoses include major depressive disorder, schizoaffective\ndisorder, anxiety disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. His mental health struggles\nplagued him in various ways, even to the date of trial, and would likely continue, though\nless so in a structured prison environment.\n\n\n       The jury found the second and fourth aggravating factors existed: Flack\nknowingly or purposefully murdered K.B. and L.B, and he killed K.B. in an especially\n                                         11\n\fheinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. It unanimously sentenced him to death. The judge\nfound \"that the aggravating factors totally outweighed any mitigating factors that were\nprovided and the evidence supports the imposition of the death penalty in this particular\ncase.\" See K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-6617(f). The court imposed the death penalty.\n\n\n       Flack directly appeals to this court. Jurisdiction is proper. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-\n6619(a) (permitting a death sentence to automatic review by and appeal to Supreme\nCourt).\n\n\n                        SUPPRESSION OF FLACK'S POLICE INTERVIEWS\n\n       Before both the preliminary hearing and trial, the State sought to admit Flack's\ncustodial statements to police. The defense argued against admission, claiming he\ninvoked his right to counsel. The court overruled his objections. Flack now argues he\ninvoked his right to silence through his repeated requests to be taken to jail, requiring\nsuppression of anything that followed.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n       When the State moved to admit Flack's custodial statements for the preliminary\nhearing, it submitted testimony from the detectives who interviewed Flack. The court\nfound the statements voluntary. It also found his alleged requests for counsel were\nequivocal and did not require the detectives to end the interview. It underscored the point\nby noting Flack knew what he had to do to end the Ottawa interview by plainly stating he\nwanted to talk to his attorney. This, the court held, was a clear communication the\ndetectives \"honored.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       At trial, a newly assigned judge took up the renewed motion to admit the custodial\nstatements for trial purposes. The State presented its witnesses again. Detective\nAlexander testified she advised Flack of his Miranda rights at the first interview in\nEmporia and had him sign a Miranda form. The transcript reflects his agreement to speak\nto the officers:\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: . . . Before you're asked any questions you must be advised and\n       understand your rights. Number one, you have the right to remain silent. Number two,\n       anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Number three, you have the\n       right to talk to a lawyer and have him with you while you've being questioned. Number\n       four, if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before\n       questioning if you wish. Number five, you can decide at any time to exercise these rights\n       and . . . not answer any questions or make any statements. . . .\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: I have read or had read to me a statement of the rights listed above. I\n       understand what the rights are and I am willing to answer questions before talking to a\n       lawyer. I do not want a lawyer present during questioning. I understand and know what I\n       am doing. No promises nor threats of any kind have been made to me and no pressure or\n       coercion of any kind has been used against me and this statement has been made by me\n       voluntarily.\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: If you agree to that, I'll have you sign it. All right, Kyle, you said\n       . . . that you were pissed off. You wanna talk to me about that?\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: Yeah.\n\n\n                 \"[Alexander]: What are you pissed off about?\n\n\n                 \"[Flack]: 'Cause I wanna know what happened to my friend.'\" (Emphases\n       added.)\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\f       Alexander testified she did not perceive any of his statements during the Emporia\ninterview as invoking his rights. She agreed that a suspect saying, \"[T]ake me to jail[.]\nI'm done, I'm tired of you asking the same questions,\" was different from asking for a\nlawyer.\n\n\n       Detective Thompson testified he did not perceive Flack's statement\u2014\"'Should I\nget a lawyer honestly?'\"\u2014as a request for an attorney. Instead, he took it as asking\nThompson's \"opinion on what he should do.\" Thompson told Flack he \"could not give\nhim legal advice.\" And when Flack told Thompson, \"I can't tell you no more, so either do\nwhatever you do or I need an attorney or something because I can't tell you what I don't\nfucking know,\" the detective took it as an \"ultimatum\" when Flack became frustrated\nwith questioning. He testified that was a consistent pattern throughout questioning:\n\"[A]nytime we began asking questions in regard to [L.B.], he became upset. Visibly his\nface would turn red. He would clinch his fists, a couple times he hit the table.\"\n\n\n       Thompson noted the Ottawa interview ended when Flack said he could not talk to\nthe detective anymore and wanted his attorney. This remark, Thompson viewed, was\ndifferent because Flack's earlier mentions of an attorney were followed up by him quickly\nsaying he wanted to help and wanted to talk to the detectives.\n\n\n       The court admitted the custodial statements over the defense objection, finding\nthem voluntary. It also determined Flack's statements, \"'[s]hould I get a lawyer\nhonestly?'\" and \"either do whatever you do or I need an attorney . . . because I can't tell\nyou what I don't know,\" were equivocal and did not invoke the right to counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fPreservation\n\n       Flack now frames his remarks\u2014i.e., demanding to be taken to jail\u2014as an\ninvocation of his right to remain silent rather than the right to counsel. Generally, \"[a]\nparty may not object to the introduction of testimony on one ground at trial and assert\nanother ground on appeal.\" State v. Green, 315 Kan. 178, 183, 505 P.3d 377 (2022). But\nin death penalty cases, K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(b) mandates that \"we consider any\nerrors the parties raise on appeal, whether preserved for review or not.\" State v. Cheever,\n295 Kan. 229, 241, 284 P.3d 1007 (2012), vacated and remanded on other grounds 571\nU.S. 87, 134 S. Ct. 596, 187 L. Ed. 2d 519 (2013).\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n       We are at a bit of a disadvantage in this appeal. Had Flack argued the right-to-\nremain-silent issue before the district court, we would apply a bifurcated standard of\nreview. See State v. Aguirre, 301 Kan. 950, 954-55, 349 P.3d 1245 (2015) (district court's\nfactual finding reviewed for substantial competent evidence and its legal conclusion de\nnovo). But he did not, and the district court's factual findings about voluntariness and\ninvocation of his right to counsel minimally assist our appellate review. Regardless, the\nrecord includes the interviews' video clips and transcripts, so we can proceed. See State v.\nKleypas, 272 Kan. 894, Syl. \u00b6 5, 40 P.3d 139 (2001) (Kleypas I) (\"When the facts\nmaterial to a decision of the court on a motion to suppress evidence are not in dispute, the\nquestion of whether to suppress becomes a question of law. An appellate court's scope of\nreview on questions of law is unlimited.\"), overruled in part on other grounds by State v.\nMarsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.3d 445 (2004), rev'd on other grounds by 548 U.S. 163, 169-\n73, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006); see also State v. Hanke, 307 Kan. 823,\n827, 415 P.3d 966 (2018) (When the material facts supporting a district court's decision\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fon a motion to suppress evidence are not in dispute, the ultimate question of whether to\nsuppress is a question of law over which an appellate court has unlimited review.).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n       An accused's right to remain silent during a custodial police interview arises under\nboth the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 954. A suspect's invocation of the \"'right\nto remain silent must be scrupulously honored and cuts off further interrogation.'\" 301\nKan. at 954. But law enforcement officers' duty to \"scrupulously honor\" a suspect's\ndecision to invoke their right requires the suspect's clear communication without any\nambiguity or equivocation. 301 Kan. at 957. Such an invocation requires context, as \"an\ninvocation that is ambiguous by itself may be unambiguous when considered in\nconjunction with the statements or events preceding it.\" United States v. Cordier, 224 F.\nSupp. 3d 835, 840 (D.S.D. 2016) (relying on Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 105 S. Ct.\n490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 [1984]).\n\n\n       Another difficulty arises because Flack does not rely on any single statement as\nthe invocation of his right. Instead, he argues various statements to take him to jail\naggregated unambiguously to invoke his right to remain silent. He says his \"intention to\nend the questioning was equally clear as he became progressively more insistent that the\nquestioning stop and that he be taken to jail.\" But \"it is not his intent that matters; it is\nwhether his statement would have been unambiguous to a reasonable officer.\" Lopez v.\nJanda, 742 Fed. Appx. 211, 214 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished opinion). In other words,\nthe issue is whether his communication was unambiguous to a reasonable officer, not just\nhim. See Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 957 (a reasonable officer's understanding matters).\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Going back to the record, Flack made his remarks over about 45 minutes, with\nmost falling during an 18-minute span, when he grew increasingly agitated as detectives\nwere hesitant to believe him and countered his story with other evidence. He grew\nparticularly angry when they pressed him about the child's location, despite him denying\nhe knew anything. We address each comment below with its relevant context.\n\n\n       His first remark expresses his frustration at the detectives' refusal to believe him.\n\n\n                \"[Alexander]: . . . We have your dad who's sayin' something totally different\n       than what you did.\n\n\n                \"[Flack]: . . . What did he supposedly say that's different than me?\n\n\n                ....\n\n\n                \"[Alexander]: That all the times you're sayin' you were with him is not the case.\n\n\n                \"[Flack]: All right, whatever, so apparently we're at a stalemate so do I put these\n       back on and you take me somewhere or what's the deal?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       This plainly fails to invoke a right to remain silent. Flack merely acknowledges his\nversion differed from his father's, and the detectives were free to not believe him. His\nsecond comment was no different.\n\n\n                \"I didn't do it at all. Think I'd kill my fuckin' friends? Kidnapping some fuckin'\n       baby, take me to jail. . . . Put these motherfuckers on me, take me where you need to do\n       . . . . But I didn't kill my fuckin' friends. I didn't kill them fuckin' people and I didn't\n       fuckin' take no baby.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                      17\n\f       Like the first statement, Flack simply told Alexander she could believe he killed\nthe victims, claiming his innocence. His requests to be taken to jail after an impasse in\nquestioning were too ambiguous to invoke the right to silence. See, e.g., State v. Speed,\n265 Kan. 26, 37, 961 P.2d 13 (1998) (\"'And since we're not getting anywhere I just ask\nyou guys to go ahead and get this over with and go ahead and lock me up and let me go\nand deal with Sedgwick County, I'm ready to go to Sedgwick County, let's go.'\"); Bullitt\nv. Commonwealth, 595 S.W.3d 106, 116-17 (Ky. 2019) (holding the defendant's\nstatement\u2014\"[I]f I'm going to jail, I'm saying, let's go, you know, that's all I'm saying, sir.\nI'm innocent, I'm innocent.\"\u2014did not invoke the right to silence).\n\n\n       His next three comments followed that same pattern, and all convey he lacked an\nanswer for the detective.\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: Where would we go to find [L.B.]?\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: How the fuck should I know?\n\n\n              \"[Alexander]: 'Cause you're the only one that does.\n\n\n              \"[Flack]: You know what?

So do whatever we're doin'. Because I can keep\n       tellin' ya the same fuckin' thing and you're gonna keep fuckin' the same thing. . . .\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Where was she left?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't fuckin' know.

The third remark was a dramatic gesture, not a substantive cutting off of\nquestioning. The fourth was so brief; it was inscrutable. And the fifth appears to be\nanother \"take me to jail\" statement, \"because . . . I can't give ya information I don't\nfuckin' have so do what you do.\" (Emphases added.) Flack was communicating if the\nofficers keep asking questions he could not answer, they should just charge him. But,\ntaken together or separately, he does not unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent.\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f       A few minutes later, the detectives encountered strong resistance when asking\nFlack why he was in Emporia. In this context, Flack made his sixth alleged invocation:\n\"You wanna . . . fuckin' take me to jail, charge me, whatever, I\u2014we done sat here and\nfuckin' talked about it, okay? It's that simple.\" But again, he did not clearly state to stop\nthe interview. Instead, he expressed frustration the officers were unwilling to trust him.\n\n\n       The final four remarks occurred when Alexander asked for detail about his\nEmporia business involving \"some Mexicans.\"\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Who were you selling dope to?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: Some Mexicans.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: What are their names?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't know their fuckin' names.\n\n\n               \"[Alexander]: Where do they live?\n\n\n               \"[Flack]: I don't know where they live.

[T]hey just contact me, tell me to\n       pick it up.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n       Flack's comments here\u2014\"What do you want me to tell you?\"\u2014and his\nstatement\u2014\"I don't know the fuckin' people\"\u2014lead to a reasonable inference Flack\nmeant \"I don't know,\" rather than invoking his right to remain silent. As the State\ncorrectly argues, his claimed invocations were \"amenable to a variety of interpretations\"\nor \"an expression of frustration and anger,\" \"a recognition of his difficult predicament,\"\n\"a hyperbolic effort to bolster his own credibility and convince the detectives that he was\ntelling the truth,\" and \"a negotiating tactic . . . intended to shape the investigator's\ninterrogation more favorably to him.\" In context, these comments show Flack believed\nthe questioning about what happened at Stout's house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right. He simply claimed the detectives had already made up\ntheir minds about his involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help\nthem find the child.\n\n\n       Under the circumstances, Flack's \"take me to jail\" comments lead to multiple\ninterpretations\u2014rendering his communication unclear. Flack had experience with police\ninterviews; read the Miranda form, which stated with particularity \"you have the right to\nremain silent,\" and \"you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and . . . not\nanswer any questions or make any statements\"; affirmatively stated he understood his\nrights; and told the detectives he would answer their questions.\n\n\n       We hold Flack did not invoke his right to remain silent by repeatedly suggesting\nhe be taken to jail. Isolated or combined, his statements did not unambiguously and\nunequivocally assert his right to silence. See People v. Davis, 46 Cal. 4th 539, 587-88, 94\n\n                                                   22\n\fCal. Rptr. 3d 322, 208 P.3d 78 (2009) (holding defendant's statement\u2014\"'Well then book\nme and let's get a lawyer and let's go for it, you know'\"\u2014was a challenge to interrogators\nthat defendant employed as interrogation technique, not a means to invoke right to\ncounsel or silence; contrasting these comments with statements later in interrogation,\n\"'get me a lawyer'\" and \"'it's over and [he was] done'\" answering questions, that\nconstituted a valid invocation); Ridley v. State, 290 Ga. 798, 801-02, 725 S.E.2d 223\n(2012) (holding \"take me on to jail\" did not unequivocally invoke the right to silence);\nState v. Waloke, 835 N.W.2d 105, 112 (S.D. 2013) (rejecting the defendant invoked her\nright to silence by stating, \"officers should just take her to jail\" as she did not explicitly\nsay she wanted to remain silent or did not want to speak with police anymore); State v.\nCummings, 357 Wis. 2d 1, 24, 850 N.W.2d 915 (2014) (holding \"'take me to my cell.\nWhy waste your time?'\" in context not unequivocal invocation); Kirk v. Carroll, 243 F.\nSupp. 2d 125, 132 (D. Del. 2003) (denying habeas relief, reasoning Delaware state court\nconclusions that, \"'Just take me away, please. Take me away,'\" and \"'Just take me the\nfuck away,'\" were not clear invocations of right to silence was not contrary to clearly\nestablished federal law); Bird v. Brigano, 295 Fed. Appx. 36, 38 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(unpublished opinion) (analyzing two exchanges during interview, first Bird said \"'there's\nno sense me sitting here trying to say what happened with me . . . because as usual, when\nit comes to Derrick Bird, he's guilty'\" and then stood up and said, \"'You take me in; get\nbooked, man,'\" and second in response to detective explaining this is your chance to talk\nBird said, \"'Everything's right there in the paper. I'm done talking about it'\"; holding\nneither were unequivocal invocations of right to remain silent when viewed in context).\n\n\n       The district court properly admitted his custodial statements.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f                          FLACK'S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE\n\n\n        Throughout Flack's case, defense counsel expressed concern they would not be\nprepared for trial. That concern became especially acute after his original counsel\nwithdrew in 2015. In response, the court continued the proceedings until the following\nspring. Despite that, the defense requested another continuance and repeated such\nrequests through the pretrial proceedings.\n\n\n        Now, on appeal, Flack asserts the district court's scheduling orders violated his\nSixth Amendment due process right to present a defense, his corresponding rights under\nsections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights, and finally his statutory rights\nunder K.S.A. 22-3406 (reasonable time to prepare for trial) and K.S.A. 22-3401\n(continuances for good cause). From this, we discern two lines for analysis. First, he\nstatutorily argues the district court abused its discretion by denying persistent\ncontinuance requests. Second, he constitutionally asserts a due process denial under the\nfederal and state Constitutions. We reject these claims.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n        Flack's court-appointed defense team changed during pretrial when his initial lead\nattorney withdrew in July 2015 and had to be replaced. Flack moved to continue the trial,\nclaiming the defense will not be prepared for a September trial and asked to postpone\nuntil next year. The court granted the motion and continued the trial to February 22,\n2016.\n\n\n        In November 2015, defense counsel filed a second motion to continue trial.\nCounsel argued the team's difficulty replacing the original attorney created a deficiency\nthat could compromise Flack's right to counsel. The team further noted it lacked\n                                           24\n\fsufficient time to review discovery and the complete investigation based on ABA\nGuidelines. See American Bar Association, American Bar Association Guidelines for the\nAppointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 31 Hofstra L.\nRev. 913, 920 (2003). The team indicated it was still developing its mitigation case. It\nhad identified family members central to Flack's \"social history\" but had not yet\ninterviewed them; some were out of state, while others were unwilling to meet with\ndefense counsel. It had hired experts in childhood development, forensic psychiatry, and\nprison adjustment, but the interviews were pending. And it was still collecting school,\nmedical, and psychiatric records. Finally, the team said its heavy caseloads were already\nhard to manage and would be compounded by the holidays.\n\n\n       The court heard the motion in late November ex parte and in camera. It\nacknowledged the team's difficulties but pointed out the case had been pending for about\ntwo years. Expressing frustration with the apparent lack of progress, it denied the request\nwithout the State's input as it was skeptical more time would materially aid the defense.\n\n\n       In January 2016, the defense renewed its motion, which was again heard by the\ncourt ex parte, in camera. Defense counsel reiterated the same concerns but highlighted\nthe need for a neuropsychologist to examine Flack and testify during the penalty phase.\nThe court denied the motion and pushed the defense to retain an expert. It asked the\ndefense to file a new continuance motion \"to clarify a little more succinctly the particular\nissues that prohibit you in proceeding.\" It said it would revisit the issue the next week.\n\n\n       When voir dire began the following week, the defense filed its third continuance\nmotion. The court heard the motion in camera after that day's questioning. Defense\ncounsel reiterated their concerns and noted the defense team had lost its administrative\nsupport. The court systematically worked through the concerns, focusing especially on\nthe efforts to retain experts. It said, \"[C]ertain issues . . . should have been taken care of\n                                                25\n\fquite [some time] ago.\" It perceived the defense's concerns as mainly being mitigation\npreparation and asked the defense to push forward over the two weeks remaining before\nthe scheduled opening statements. It also advised the defense to continue preparing its\nmitigation case during the guilt phase.\n\n\n       Toward the end of the week, the court returned to the continuance motion. By that\ntime, the defense had retained a neuropsychologist to begin work within a few weeks and\nwould take about a week to finish. The parties discussed a plan to push back the guilt\nphase to accommodate the expert and proposed the court complete voir dire and conduct\njury selection by February 17. The guilt phase would be pushed back to March 7, and the\npenalty phase to March 28. The court agreed, and the trial proceeded on that schedule.\nBut when the trial began, defense counsel asked for further postponement, saying only\n\"[w]e believe we've litigated this issue thoroughly.\" The court denied the request.\n\n\nStatutory challenge\u2014a reasonable time to prepare for trial\n\n\n       We review continuance denials for abuse of discretion. A court abuses its\ndiscretion when its action is unreasonable or based on an error of law or fact. The party\nasserting an abuse of discretion must demonstrate it. State v. Hillard, 315 Kan. 732, 760,\n511 P.3d 883 (2022). Here, Flack does not claim the district court erred based on an error\nof law or fact; our focus is whether the district court erred by acting unreasonably.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3401 requires all persons charged with a crime to be tried without\nunnecessary delay and, at the same time, allows a district court to continue proceedings\nwhen good cause is shown. In addition, K.S.A. 22-3406 entitles a defendant to \"a\nreasonable time to prepare for trial.\" Flack alleges he was denied a reasonable time to\nprepare his case.\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       The ABA Guidelines thoroughly outline recommendations for defense counsel's\nduties in all aspects of death penalty cases. Flack relies almost exclusively on the\nguidelines and argues those obligations made his case especially time consuming,\njustifying his requested continuances. Generally, capital cases have \"extraordinary\ncomplexity and demands\" compared to noncapital cases. ABA Guidelines, 31 Hofstra L.\nRev. at 921. For example, capital cases increase defense counsel's obligations to\ninvestigate mitigators. See generally 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 924-28. In addition, counsel\nshould \"at all stages of the case . . . make every appropriate effort to establish a\nrelationship of trust with the client, and should maintain close contact with the client.\"\nABA Guideline 10.5. Counsel also must \"conduct thorough and independent\ninvestigations relating to the issues of both guilt and penalty.\" ABA Guideline 10.7(A).\nAnd counsel must consider and assert all potential legal claims at both the guilt and\npenalty phases and each claim's costs and benefits. ABA Guideline 10.8.\n\n\n       The ABA Guidelines are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim in a capital case, but they are not \"coextensive with\nconstitutional requirements.\" State v. Cheatham, 296 Kan. 417, 433, 292 P.3d 318\n(2013). The guidelines and their comments are useful to gauge what is \"a reasonable time\nto prepare for trial\" under K.S.A. 22-3406, and how a district court should exercise\ndiscretion when deciding whether to grant a continuance. The concern is not whether\ncounsel satisfied the guidelines, but rather whether, in considering various circumstances\npresented in a particular case, including the guidelines, the district court gave the defense\nreasonable time to prepare for trial. Granted, the guidelines can contextualize the\nproblems facing capital defense counsel, but caselaw ultimately governs whether a\ncontinuance denial rises to an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n       In State v. Robinson, 303 Kan. 11, 363 P.3d 875 (2015), disapproved of on other\ngrounds by State v. Cheever, 306 Kan. 760, 402 P.3d 1126 (2017), for example, we found\n                                          27\n\fno abuse of discretion in a district court's denial of continuances in a capital murder case\nafter comparing it to other similar cases. See 303 Kan. at 92-93 (listing cases). There, we\nacknowledged retained counsel's withdrawal \"certainly increased appointed counsel's\nworkload and responsibility\" but noted \"they were not starting from scratch.\" 303 Kan. at\n92. At the time of the withdrawal, counsel had been working for seven months. And the\ndistrict judge granted Robinson a continuance, giving newly appointed counsel another\nseven months to prepare. \"Appointed counsel also had the benefit of the preparation\n[prior counsel] had done over the course of nearly 2 years.\" 303 Kan. at 92. The Robinson\ncourt held \"the district judge properly exercised his lawful discretion by refusing requests\nfor a second continuance to prepare the guilt phase defense,\" reasoning a reasonable fact-\nfinder could have agreed with that ruling. 303 Kan. at 93; see also State v. Green, 315\nKan. 178, 179-80, 505 P.3d 377 (2022) (\"A court abuses its discretion if its action . . . 'is\n. . . unreasonable, i.e., if no reasonable person would have taken the view adopted by the\ntrial court.'\").\n\n\n        In Flack's case, almost two years and 10 months elapsed between his initial\ncounsel entering an appearance and trial. Nearly two years passed between his second\ncounsel entering an appearance and trial, and almost a full year passed between his third\ncounsel entering her appearance and trial. Initial and second counsel worked together for\nabout one year and three months, and the remaining counsel worked together for about\n250 days before trial after initial counsel retired in July 2015.\n\n\n        The first continuance request relied on the ABA Guidelines and focused on initial\ncounsel's withdrawal, remaining counsel's other caseload and inexperience in capital\ncases, the volume of discovery to review, and the need to retain expert witnesses. The\ncourt granted the continuance, mostly based on the original counsel's withdrawal.\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\f       Flack requested a second continuance so counsel could provide Flack \"with the\nhigh-quality legal representation contemplated under prevailing Constitutional and\nprofessional standards.\" The motion again cited the ABA Guidelines and highlighted\ndefense counsel's independent duty to investigate. The defense noted it had recently\nreceived \"20,000 pages and 500 discs\" of discovery and \"more than 100 scientific\nreports\" from the State. They were also waiting on their own experts' reports. The court\ndeferred ruling and asked the defense to push forward and keep it apprised of problems as\nthey arose.\n\n\n       The third continuance remained much the same as the second. The defense filed it\nat the court's request during voir dire to reflect the previously raised issues' status. The\ndefense was still reviewing and synthesizing discovery and conducting its investigation.\nBut the most pressing issue was securing a neuropsychologist, which the defense did on\nFebruary 4. The court, with the State's agreement, pushed the trial's start date from\nFebruary 22 to March 7 to allow the expert to evaluate Flack.\n\n\n       We discern no abuse of discretion in denying the second and third continuance\nrequests. As in Robinson, Flack's initial counsel was a single member of a three-counsel\nteam. He left second counsel with over a year on the case and a third counsel who joined\nthe team a few months earlier. Similarly, original counsel's withdrawal did not require the\nteam to start from scratch. Recognizing second counsel could not just pick up where\noriginal counsel left off, the court granted a continuance of several months. As to the\nsecond request, the court pushed the defense to make progress and pointedly questioned\nwhat aspects were challenging. Over the next months, the outstanding tasks narrowed,\neven as the defense continued to press for postponement. The largest obstacle, needing a\nneuropsychologist, became clear as trial approached, and the court granted a short\ncontinuance.\n\n\n                                              29\n\f       Throughout this process, the record reflects the court seriously considered the\ndefense's concerns and worked to address them as they arose. It reasonably handled the\ncase and did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\nConstitutional challenge\u2014right to present a defense\n\n\n       Flack argues the denial of his second and third continuance requests violated his\nright to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nand under sections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. We reject these\narguments.\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment states: \"[T]he accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and\npublic trial, by an impartial jury . . . ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to\nhave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.\" Section 5 declares: \"The right of trial by jury shall be\ninviolate.\" And section 10 \"allow[s]\" the accused to\n\n\n       \"appear and defend in person, or by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the\n       accusation against him; to meet the witness face to face, and to have compulsory process\n       to compel the attendance of the witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an\n       impartial jury . . . . No person shall be a witness against himself, or be twice put in\n       jeopardy for the same offense.\"\n\n\n       The phrase \"right to present a defense\" is a blanket term for a collection of a\ndefendant's rights, including a right to present evidence on his or her own behalf. See\nState v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, 207-08, 331 P.3d 544 (2014) (R. Carr I) (discussing nature of\n\"right to present a defense,\" focusing on rules for excluding evidence and right to present\ntheory of defense), rev'd and remanded on other grounds 577 U.S. 108, 136 S. Ct. 633,\n\n                                                    30\n\f193 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2016); United States v. Markey, 393 F.3d 1132, 1135 (10th Cir. 2004)\n(a defendant's \"right to present a defense\" refers to the collective rights \"to testify, present\nwitnesses in his own defense, and to cross-examine witnesses against him\" rooted in the\nFifth and Sixth Amendments). In some contexts, a continuance denial may implicate\nrights under the umbrella of \"right to present a defense.\" See Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S.\n1, 11-12, 103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1983) (\"[A]rbitrary 'insistence upon\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay' violates the right to the\nassistance of counsel.\").\n\n\n       The United States Supreme Court provides a \"continuance is traditionally within\nthe discretion of the trial judge.\" Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11\nL. Ed. 2d 921 (1964). When a request is reasonable, a continuance denial may\n\"myopic[ally] insist[] upon expeditiousness . . . render[ing] the right to defend with\ncounsel an empty formality.\" 376 U.S. at 589. The Court conceded, \"There are no\nmechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate\n[the accused's constitutional rights],\" but it noted, \"The answer must be found in the\ncircumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial\njudge at the time the request is denied.\" 376 U.S. at 589.\n\n\n       We review a continuance denial's possible interference with the right to present a\ndefense de novo. See Robinson, 303 Kan. at 85. Like the Ungar Court found the answer\nin the circumstances, we examine various factors present in a particular case. In State v.\nAnthony, 257 Kan. 1003, 898 P.2d 1109 (1995), a defendant contended the trial court\ndenied him his right to retain chosen counsel by failing to grant a continuance so that his\nretained counsel could prepare for his case. When rejecting his constitutional claim, the\nAnthony court considered several factors, including whether other continuances have\nbeen granted; whether legitimate reasons were shown to postpone trial; and whether\ndenial of the continuance would prejudice the defendant. The Anthony court held the trial\n                                           31\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance in which the sole reason for\nthe continuance was to permit new counsel to enter his appearance. 257 Kan. at 1019.\nHere, the trial began some eight months after his original counsel withdrew, and Flack\nproceeded with the same appointed counsel team he had all along. Moreover, the district\ncourt gave counsel reasonable time to prepare a capital case given the defense team's\nrelative continuity and the total time available.\n\n\n       We hold the district court's handling of continuance requests did not violate\nFlack's Sixth Amendment right to present a defense or his rights under sections 5 and 10\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.\n\n\n                   DENIAL OF FOR-CAUSE CHALLENGES TO SITTING JURORS\n\n\n       Throughout voir dire, the district court denied several defense for-cause challenges\nto selected jury members. These challenges questioned prospective jurors' predisposition\nto the death penalty. Some challenged members joined the 20 jurors and alternates who\nheard the case, and some of those joined the 12 who convicted Flack and sentenced him\nto death. On appeal, Flack argues the district court committed reversible error by denying\nhis challenges. Again, we disagree.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n       When voir dire began, the court separated prospective jurors into six panels. It\nquestioned two panels per day over nine days to reduce the initial group from which the\nparties could exercise peremptory challenges. Each party received 20 peremptory\nchallenges to produce a final jury of 20, including eight alternates.\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\f       During peremptory challenges, defense counsel asked for \"extra strikes\" because\nthe court denied so many of the defense's for-cause challenges. The court ruled this was\npremature since the defense had not yet exhausted all of its peremptory strikes. After\nexercising its seventeenth peremptory challenge, the defense renewed its request for more\nstrikes. The State opposed this for two reasons. First, the defense still had some\nperemptory strikes. Second, procedurally it was unclear where the new strikes would\ncome from because alternate jurors were necessary. The court denied the request,\nreasoning the defense had already struck the only juror who was arguably \"automatic\ndeath.\" The defense then formally objected to the 20 selected jurors' composition. The\ncourt randomly selected alternate jurors but did not disclose to the jury who it selected\nuntil deliberations.\n\n\n       When trial began, the court released three jurors after each raised an issue,\nbringing the jury down to 17. Before deliberations, the court named the alternates, and\nthe 12 primary jurors deliberated and ultimately entered guilty verdicts.\n\n\n       Prior to the penalty phase, the court conducted a second voir dire at the defense's\npretrial request to determine whether any jurors, including the alternates, had reached an\nopinion on a death sentence. The jurors were questioned individually, outside the\npresence of the others. The court asked five questions and then allowed follow-up\nquestions by the State and defense.\n\n\n       Juror J.B.'s responses during questioning raised concerns when he expressed\nreluctance to change his mind about imposing the death penalty. While claiming he\nwould follow the law and consider all mitigating circumstances, his skepticism persisted.\nAfter questioning the other jurors, the defense asked to remove two potential jurors,\nincluding J.B. Given J.B.'s role as part of the 12-member jury that convicted Flack, the\ncourt removed J.B. But it retained the other juror as being an alternate.\n                                             33\n\f       On appeal, Flack lists 18 potential jurors denied a for-cause challenge. But Flack\nused peremptory challenges to remove 16 of those 18.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review for-cause juror challenges for an abuse of discretion because the trial\njudge is better positioned to make the ruling. Robinson, 303 Kan. at 154. \"Appellate\ncourts have traditionally accorded a great deal of deference to a trial court's ruling on a\njuror challenge for cause.\" State v. Miller, 308 Kan. 1119, 1138, 427 P.3d 907 (2018).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3410(1) permits a party to \"challenge any prospective juror for cause.\"\nAmong the nine grounds listed in K.S.A. 22-3410(2) is: \"(i) His state of mind with\nreference to the case or any of the parties is such that the court determines there is doubt\nthat he can act impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of any party.\" In\ndeath penalty cases, prospective jurors may be excluded when their views on the death\npenalty \"would 'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror.'\"\nWainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985). This\napplies whether the challenge is directed at death-leaning or life-leaning jurors. R. Carr I,\n300 Kan. 1, Syl. \u00b6 20. The pertinent question for our appellate review is not whether we\nagree with the district judge's ruling but, instead, whether the record fairly supports its\nruling. Robinson, 303 Kan. at 155.\n\n\n       Of the 18 jurors Flack discusses, only M.F. and J.H. ended up as jurors. And as the\nState correctly notes, the relevant question is whether the seated jurors prejudiced Flack.\nSee Miller, 308 Kan. at 1138 (failing to excuse a juror for cause requires conviction\n                                            34\n\freversal only when the defendant demonstrates he or she was prejudiced as a result).\nEven if a defendant was compelled to use peremptory challenges \"to correct erroneous\nfor-cause rulings,\" it is a nonissue absent the defendant showing the sitting jury was\nprejudiced. 308 Kan. at 1139. Flack, as the party asserting the error, bears the burden of\nestablishing the denial of a for-cause challenge constituted an abuse of discretion and\nresulted in prejudice. 308 Kan. at 1138.\n\n\nJuror M.F.\n\n\n       During the State's initial voir dire, the prosecutor asked M.F. about her general\nviews on the death penalty. In the past, M.F. strongly supported the death penalty without\nmuch knowledge. But after working for a judge who opposed it, she reevaluated her\nstance. She said the judge told her that \"many people are in prison that later they're found\nnot guilty.\" She then noted, \"I need to be open to hearing all of the information and\nunderstanding the whole story before I can say strongly one way or the other.\"\n\n\n       During defense questioning, M.F. said she would consider factors such as the\ndegree of the childhood abuse or the mental illness, as well as a person's adaptability to\nprison, as potential mitigating circumstances. But she \"need[ed] more information to\nmake a decision.\" Counsel further asked about her shifting death penalty views. She\nreiterated, \"I don't feel strongly one way or the other about the death penalty. But it\ndefinitely is going to have to be very clear [that the defendant is guilty.]\"\n\n\n       In her questionnaire, M.F. suggested childhood experience \"plays a huge role\" but\nshould not affect capital sentencing. She believed individuals must take responsibility for\ntheir choices and must not blame others. M.F. noted she would consider factors \"more\nserious than [abuse or unloved]\" necessary to warrant capital punishment.\n\n\n                                              35\n\f       The defense challenged M.F. for cause, focusing on her questionnaire response\nsuggesting the death penalty was appropriate in a multiple victim case \"if there's\nabsolutely no question about [the] person's guilt.\" She \"equivocate[d]\" in her written\nresponses about her beliefs and opinions on the death penalty, which defense counsel\nclaimed made it \"hard to draw out any information what her thoughts are.\" The defense\ncharacterized her responses as \"it depends.\" Counsel argued M.F. conveyed believing\npeople must take personal responsibility for their actions created a \"mitigation\nimpairment with her.\" Ultimately, \"there's a doubt that she could be impartial.\"\n\n\n       The court rejected this, reasoning M.F. appeared to be more favorable to the\ndefense than some jurors the defense previously challenged. M.F. affirmed she had not\nformed an opinion on Flack's guilt from media or pretrial sources. The court emphasized\nher evolving beliefs about the death penalty and her \"conscientious\" approach, expressing\nfaith in her ability to be fair, impartial, and law-abiding at sentencing.\n\n\n       In his brief, Flack argues M.F. dismissed the importance of extreme childhood\nexperiences and said mercy would play no role in her penalty decision. He contends her\nstance, even after agreeing to follow the law, is \"devastating\" to a fair penalty trial, as her\n\"willingness to follow the law does not prevent long held biases from affecting a\nverdict.\"\n\n\n       But contrary to Flack's contention, during voir dire, M.F. consistently expressed\nshe could not definitively answer how various factors would weigh in her decision-\nmaking process without knowing more. She clarified her questionnaire response,\nexplaining that while she would not be swayed by typical childhood traumas, she would\nconsider more serious circumstances. The record shows M.F. was open to mitigation\nevidence, and her reservation about childhood experiences pertains more to their abstract\npersuasiveness rather than a complete rejection.\n                                            36\n\f       Finally, Flack seemingly argues a juror is biased if he or she is unwilling to rely on\nthe nebulous concept of mercy alone for mitigation. But he cites no support for this. As\nJustice Scalia once noted, \"what one juror might consider mitigating another might not.\nAnd of course the ultimate question whether mitigating circumstances outweigh\naggravating circumstances is mostly a question of mercy\u2014the quality of which, as we\nknow, is not strained.\" Kansas v. Carr, 577 U.S. 108, 119, 136 S. Ct. 633, 193 L. Ed. 2d\n535 (2016). So even if M.F. said \"mercy\"\u2014a concept she equated with \"pity\" during voir\ndire\u2014should not be considered on her questionnaire, she remained willing to consider the\nvarious circumstances in Flack's case before reaching a decision.\n\n\n       Rather than showing a preformed bias favoring the death penalty, M.F.'s voir dire\nresponses consistently reflected a willingness to wait and see the evidence before\ndeciding, which is exactly what a juror should do. The court scrutinized her qualifications\nand outlined its reasons why she was a qualified juror. As it pointed out, given her\nhesitation about the death penalty, if anything, M.F. was a favorable defense juror. It was\nneither error nor an abuse of discretion for the court to deny this challenge.\n\n\nJuror J.H.\n\n\n       During voir dire, J.H. reiterated a neutral view on the death penalty, expressing a\ncommitment to base his decision on the case's facts and the court's instructions. He\nacknowledged \"there's no rehabilitation\" for some people but noted sometimes \"people\nget into situations\" and there are \"so many hypothetical situations out there.\" J.H.\nrecognized the weighty responsibility of imposing the death penalty, underscoring the\nneed for certainty in such decisions.\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f         On his questionnaire, J.H. indicated a belief that mercy should not play a role in\nsentencing. And when asked whether he believed in an \"eye for an eye,\" his answer was,\n\"Let the punishment fit the crime.\" During voir dire, when questioned about his \"eye for\nan eye\" response, he explained he could envision \"a hypothetical situation\" in which a\ncrime is \"so horrific\" that he could support the death penalty. But he acknowledged the\ndeath penalty is not suitable for every murder case, although it is \"there for a reason\" and\nthere are situations in which it can be used. J.H. admitted that until he learned the juror's\nrole during this process, he had not deeply considered his stance on the death penalty.\n\n\n         Following the conclusion of J.H.'s panel, defense counsel challenged him for cause\nbased on his questionnaire responses. Counsel interpreted J.H.'s \"eye for an eye\" response\nas potentially shifting the burden to the defense to \"prove . . . that life without the\npossibility of parole was deserved.\" The court rejected this challenge, finding J.H.'s\nresponses indicated he has not yet made up his mind one way or the other and\ncharacterizing him as \"middle of the road\" on the death penalty. The court found no\nreason to doubt his fairness and impartiality during the guilt phase, and that he conveyed\na willingness to consider the mitigating circumstances if the case reached the penalty\nphase.\n\n\n         On appeal, Flack claims the district court abused its discretion by denying his for-\ncause challenge to J.H., because of his questionnaire responses: \"Let the punishment fit\nthe crime,\" and mercy should not be a factor in his decision-making. Flack continues that\nJ.H. \"harbor[ed] an unacceptable bias on a matter crucial for a fair proceeding,\" even if\nhe agreed to follow the law.\n\n\n         Nevertheless, like M.F., the record establishes J.H. would listen to the evidence\nand decide the case on the facts and law. And we hold the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying these challenges.\n                                              38\n\fJurors not challenged for cause\n\n\n       Besides M.F. and J.H., Flack argues three other seated jurors were similarly\nbiased: J.S., C.C., and G.B. He asserts both J.S. and C.C. expressed their belief that\nchildhood experiences and mercy were irrelevant considerations for determining\npunishment, citing only their questionnaire responses. For J.S. and C.C., Flack adds that\nalthough each agreed to consider childhood experiences during voir dire, the prosecution\nled them to agree only to \"consider\" mitigators, without committing to \"meaningful\nconsideration,\" potentially prejudicing the defense.\n\n\n       As for J.S., the defense questioning was cursory. When asked about his thoughts\non the death penalty, he replied he could impose it in some cases depending on the\nevidence. Similarly, when asked about his starting position for or against the death\npenalty, he stated he did not have an opinion until he considered the evidence. Defense\ncounsel asked each juror if they could \"consider mercy for that guilty murder\"; J.S.\nsimply replied, \"Yes.\" Counsel did not follow up. In fact, his response to most questions\nwas a simple yes or no. And he said he would follow and apply the law. When asked\nabout mitigating factors, he answered he would consider the evidence whether \"the\nperson really . . . [was] aware of what he was doing.\"\n\n\n       The State asked C.C. to elaborate on her questionnaire responses about the effect\nof childhood experiences. She elucidated upbringing may not always determine the\noutcome, but \"a loving, caring home\" increases the likelihood of the individuals \"turning\nout to be better people.\" Despite this, she acknowledged she had written that \"people are\nresponsible for their actions.\" The State followed by asking whether she could consider\nchildhood experiences as mitigating factors, C.C. replied people \"have to be accountable\n\n\n                                            39\n\ffor [their actions]\" but she \"would consider aggravating and mitigating\" factors and\n\"weigh them up\" in her decision-making process.\n\n\n       When questioned by defense counsel, C.C. acknowledged she placed greater\nimportance on the circumstances of killing in the context of aggravating and mitigating\nconsiderations. She confirmed \"the background of a person\" would not matter to her. But\nshe clarified a commitment to fairness and honesty in weighing these factors. After\nfurther questioning, C.C. agreed she would give the defense's mitigators weight, consider\nthem, and \"truly give [them] meaningful consideration.\"\n\n\n       As for G.B., Flack contends he \"expressed strong biases in favor of the death\npenalty, writing that he definitely favored the death penalty, if the murder of a mother\nand child were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" G.B. did not think childhood\nexperiences were relevant to capital punishment, as there was \"'no excuse for capital\nmurder.'\" Flack claims the \"upshot\" of G.B.'s agreement to \"consider\" childhood\nexperiences after saying they were not \"relevant\" on his questionnaire was \"that he would\nconsider them but not give them relevance.\"\n\n\n       On his questionnaire, G.B. acknowledged the role of upbringing in adult behavior\nbut maintained it did not excuse capital murder. The State asked whether his position\nchanged after he understood the process for imposing the death penalty; G.B. said he\nwould consider any mitigating circumstances he was instructed to consider. Defense\ncounsel gave G.B. a hypothetical of a conviction with various aggravators. Counsel asked\nhow jurors should view the death penalty before factoring in any mitigators. G.B.\nanswered, \"You have to look at the mitigators to get it on the scale and the aggravators\nwould have to outweigh the mitigators.\" Counsel characterized his questionnaire response\nabout the likelihood of imposing the death penalty for the premeditated capital murder of\na woman and child as \"almost automatic.\" But G.B. clarified that was not what he had\n                                          40\n\fmeant, \"[i]t depends on all the evidence presented.\" G.B. also noted that after he learned\n\"how the system works,\" he could consider childhood experiences as a mitigating\ncircumstance.\n\n\n       The State, of course, did not have a chance to rehabilitate the jurors because Flack\ndid not challenge them during the trial. Likewise, the court could not make a record for\nappellate review on each juror's ability to be fair and impartial. Thus, Flack's failure\nburdens our analysis.\n\n\n       Flack's cursory argument about these jurors' prejudices focuses on their limited\nresponses and matter-of-course agreement to apply the law as instructed. But the record\nestablishes trial counsel never probed deeper into the concerns appellate counsel now\nraises. Nothing shows these jurors were improperly prejudiced or biased against Flack.\nThe district court conducted voir dire carefully and cautiously, addressing the defense's\nconcerns seriously. The follow-up voir dire questioning either clarified or rehabilitated\neach juror's positions, so the court could reasonably conclude these jurors would be fair\nand impartial. We find no error.\n\n\n                           GUILT PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack asserts three instances of guilt-phase prosecutorial error that, individually\nand collectively, warrant conviction reversal. First, he claims the State's repeated use of\nthe expression \"level[ing] the scales\" during voir dire to describe the jury's role at\nsentencing negated the presumption of life in Kansas. Second, he argues the State's\nmention of Mother's Day during opening statements to describe the discovery of L.B.'s\nbody was inflammatory and meant to provoke juror sympathy. Third, he claims a\nbaseball analogy during the State's closing rebuttal argument gave an incorrect reasonable\ndoubt definition. We disagree.\n                                              41\n\fStandard of review\n\n\n       We review prosecutorial error claims in two steps: error and prejudice. First, we\ndetermine whether the alleged acts \"'fall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to\nconduct the State's case.'\" State v. Blansett, 309 Kan. 401, 412, 435 P.3d 1136 (2019).\nSecond, if we find error, we then \"'determine whether the error prejudiced the defendant's\ndue process rights to a fair trial.'\" 309 Kan. at 412. In the second step, we apply the\nconstitutional harmlessness standard laid out in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87\nS. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967), which demands the State show beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the prosecutorial error did not affect the trial's outcome in light of the entire\nrecord. In other words, the question is whether there is no reasonable possibility that the\nerror contributed to the verdict. Blansett, 309 Kan. at 412.\n\n\nLeveling the scales\n\n\n       Before each voir dire panel, the State consistently described the transition from the\nguilt phase to the penalty phase by using the colloquialism \"level[ing] the scales.\" In one\npanel, for example, the prosecutor told jurors they would once again hear the evidence\nand follow the judge's instructions. And based on the evidence and the law, the jury\nwould determine whether the sentence should be life without the possibility of parole or\nthe death penalty. The prosecutor illustrated the \"concept of the process\" as: \"You have a\nscale, you level the scale. . . . Then you consider the circumstances.\"\n\n\n       These included the statutory aggravating circumstances the State had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt on one side and the mitigating circumstances, which need not\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the other. The prosecutor told the panel, \"The\nweighing of circumstance is an individual determination\" \"based upon your own life\n                                           42\n\fexperiences, and your values.\" The prosecutor concluded if \"[t]he aggravators outweigh\nthe mitigators, imposition of the death penalty. If the mitigators outweigh the\naggravators, life without the possibility of parole. If they're equal, imposition of the death\npenalty.\" The prosecutor used a similar description with each panel.\n\n\n       In Kansas, our statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty requires a\nsentencing jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory aggravating\ncircumstance and, \"further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not\noutweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist.\" K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 21-6617(e). Under this scheme, if the aggravating circumstances and mitigating\ncircumstances are in \"equipoise,\" as we have termed it, the sentence is death. Kansas v.\nMarsh, 548 U.S. 163, 179, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006).\n\n\n       In Marsh, the defendant argued the equipoise provision \"establishes an\nunconstitutional presumption in favor of death.\" 548 U.S. at 166-67. But the Court\nrejected that argument and held it was constitutionally permissible for an equipoise\nweighing to result in a death sentence. In reaching that conclusion, the Court stated our\n\"sentencing system is dominated by the presumption that life imprisonment is the\nappropriate sentence for a capital conviction\" because it requires a life sentence if the\nState fails to meet its burden to prove an aggravating circumstance. 548 U.S. at 178.\nFlack argues the presumption of life the Court found \"dominated\" our system means the\n\"jury does not start with level scales.\" He asserts that because \"'level scales' is a more\ncolloquial term for equipoise,\" the prosecutor's language \"with every jury panel, and thus\nwith every seated juror,\" \"primed the jury to start from equipoise rather than the proper\npresumption of life.\"\n\n\n       We agree with Flack's premise that our capital sentencing scheme includes a\npresumption of life. But we do not agree with his conclusion that the prosecutor's\n                                           43\n\f\"level[ing] the scales\" phrasing contradicted that presumption or misstated the law. The\n\"default\" sentence after a capital conviction is a life sentence without the possibility of\nparole. And that default continues until the State proves, and the jury finds, an\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. It is only at that point the weighing\nprocess or \"scales\" come into play. The prosecutor's analogy did not misinform the jury\nand imply a presumption of death. Rather, it conveyed just the opposite: that the guilty\nverdict itself carried no weight in sentencing deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold the prosecutor's description of the deliberative process accurately\nexplained the State's burden to prove an aggravating circumstance and the weighing\nprocess that follows. The prosecutor's comments were not error.\n\n\nProsecutor's reference to Mother's Day\n\n\n       The State's opening statement made a single reference to Mother's Day before\ndescribing law enforcement's discovery of L.B.'s body: \"In just a few hours it will be\nMother's Day. It's May 11th, 2013. And at this point in the evening the sun has set,\ndarkness has fallen, and there's a group of officers and they're huddled together on a\nbridge.\" Flack argues the fact it was almost Mother's Day was immaterial and meant to\ninflame the jurors' sympathies. We disagree.\n\n\n       Prosecutors have wide latitude when crafting opening and closing statements, so\nlong as their statements \"'accurately reflect the evidence, accurately state the law, and\ncannot be \"intended to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury or to divert the jury\nfrom its duty to decide the case based on the evidence and the controlling law.\"'\" State v.\nBodine, 313 Kan. 378, 406, 486 P.3d 551 (2021). When deciding whether a prosecutor's\nstatement falls outside the wide latitude given, we consider \"'the context in which the\nstatement was made, rather than analyzing the statement in isolation.'\" 313 Kan. at 407.\n                                           44\n\f       In State v. Henry, 273 Kan. 608, 640, 44 P.3d 466 (2002), the court determined a\nprosecutor's comment to \"'think about Mother's Day yesterday, and her mom how she\nmust have felt. Now [the victim] will never have a chance to be a mother, this young\nprofessional sharp, security conscious woman . . . .'\" The Henry court noted, \"The\nprosecutor's reference to the mother's grief and the introduction of the mother's testimony\nwas not relevant to whether the defendant was afflicted by mental disease or defect at the\ntime of the alleged crimes. The prosecutor clearly intended to inflame the passion and\nprejudice of the jury.\" 273 Kan. at 641; cf. State v. Chandler, 307 Kan. 657, 690, 414\nP.3d 713 (2018) (prosecutor stated defendant \"'robbed her own children of their father'\"\nand elicited sympathy for the children).\n\n\n       But the prosecutor's reference to Mother's Day here is distinguishable from Henry.\nThe prosecutor was painting a scene describing law enforcement's discovery of L.B.'s\nbody that included many details not necessary to the case, such as describing the cool\nspring evening and use of flashlights. The only reference to Mother's Day was followed\nby 11 days of testimony and evidence, so its alleged appeal to passion seems overblown.\nThe State never mentioned it again. Nor did it ever imply finding L.B.'s body just before\nMother's Day was any worse or more tragic than any other day. The comment was within\nthe wide latitude given to prosecutors in crafting an opening statement and not error.\n\n\nBaseball analogy\n\n\n       Flack's final guilt-phase prosecutorial error challenge is to a Chicago Cubs\nanalogy the prosecutor used in rebuttal closing argument. The prosecutor stated:\n\n\n               \"We've not asked you to ignore anything. What we've asked you to do is look at\n       the totality, look at all of it. When you consider the defendant's actions before the crime,\n\n                                                    45\n\f       during the crime, after the crime. When you consider the defendant's words, his\n       statements about what happened. And then you take that and you consider other witness\n       observations, the physical and scientific evidence, when you look at all of that, all of that\n       leads to one conclusion. It's him. It's no one else. It's simply him. No matter how many\n       times, no matter how many ways, the defendant's version that there were other people\n       involved is simply not supported by evidence.\n\n\n               \"You know in terms of possibility, every February I'm a happy man. I'm a happy\n       man because on February 15th it's the start of spring training and as a lifelong Chicago\n       Cubs fan, I am filled with hope because it is possible, it is possible that this could be the\n       Cubs year. But inevitably, inevitably sometimes by June, sometimes late August, it is no\n       longer possible that it's going to be the Cubs year. I'll keep my fingers crossed in terms of\n       the season. I'll keep superstitions and I'll have to go spit in the river now or something.\n       But there's always possibilities, but there comes a point, just like in baseball that at some\n       point in the season it's no longer possible that our team is going to win the pennant or our\n       team is going to go to the World Series.\n\n\n               \"There comes a point when it is not possible and it's not possible because it's not\n       supported by hard evidence. And the hard evidence, the circumstantial evidence here, all\n       overwhelmingly points to one person and one person alone.\"\n\n\n       Flack argues this analogy improperly sought to define reasonable doubt akin to the\npuzzle analogy disapproved of in State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 115-18, 378 P.3d 1060\n(2016). Again, we disagree.\n\n\n       In Sherman, the State showed a PowerPoint slide depicting Mount Rushmore with\nTheodore Roosevelt's face removed. The slide contained the question, \"'Do you have a\nREASONABLE DOUBT this is Mt. Rushmore??'\" and, \"'Even though you can't see all\nfour figures!!'\" 305 Kan. at 96. We disapproved because this analogy \"improperly\nequated a juror's prior knowledge about the picture being displayed to his or her 'life\nexperience.'\" 305 Kan. at 116. It inappropriately \"foster[ed] the illusion that the jurors\n                                                    46\n\falready know the full picture of the case they are hearing and are simply looking for\npieces of evidence to match it.\" 305 Kan. at 116. Contrary to that implication, \"we insist\nthat jurors have minimal to no prior knowledge of a case precisely to prevent them from\nseeking evidence to confirm a preconceived narrative and conclusion.\" 305 Kan. at 116.\n\n\n       Flack argues the baseball analogy just substitutes baseball wins and losses for\npieces of a puzzle. He argues the prosecutor was telling the jury it did not need to see the\nfull season play out and could turn off the TV and assume the worst \"based on their\nknowledge of how such things usually go.\" But one obvious problem with his argument\nis that the analogy does not attempt to describe reasonable doubt, let alone define it. The\nprosecution does not mention reasonable doubt until later, when it still does not try to\ndefine it.\n\n\n       Based on the context, this permissibly appealed to the jury's common sense to\nevaluate the weaknesses in Flack's case. See State v. Butler, 307 Kan. 831, 867-68, 416\nP.3d 116 (2018) (permissible for prosecution to say the defendant's version of events was\nridiculous, not believable). The prosecutor specifically mentioned Flack's claim that more\npeople were involved and used baseball to argue the evidence does not support that. He\nseems to have been saying that at some point, based on how a baseball season works, a\nteam might have so many losses it simply cannot win the season\u2014it is not possible to get\nto the World Series. By analogy, the prosecutor pointed out there was more than enough\ncontrary evidence to show Flack's version was impossible. We hold this was not error.\n\n\n       We find no prosecutorial error during the trial's guilt phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f                         PENALTY-PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack alleges three prosecutorial errors that occurred in the penalty-phase closing\narguments. He claims the prosecutor erred by (1) repeatedly asking the jury to consider,\n\"What is justice?\" (2) stating facts not in evidence when he implied Flack could access\nmental health treatment in prison and stated Flack's family would be \"healed\" regardless\nof the sentence, and (3) improperly interjecting opinion into the case by suggesting as a\n\"seasoned prosecutor\" he knew the death penalty was appropriate here. We hold no error\noccurred.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       Our standard of review for prosecutorial error claims in the penalty phase largely\nremains unchanged from the guilt phase, although, in a capital murder trial, a prosecutor\nhas a \"'heightened duty'\" to refrain from committing error due to \"'the life and death\nnature of the proceedings.'\" State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, 315, 382 P.3d 373 (2016)\n(Kleypas II). If there are multiple prosecutorial errors, the inquiry \"'is whether the total\neffect of the cumulative [errors] found to exist, viewed in light of the record as a whole,\nhad little, if any, likelihood [or any reasonable possibility] of changing the jury's ultimate\nconclusion regarding the weight of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.'\" 305\nKan. at 315.\n\n\n\"What is justice?\"\n\n\n       Flack challenges the prosecutor repeatedly asking, \"What is justice?\" during\nopening and closing statements. His opening statement began and ended with this theme:\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\f           \"The penalty phase, it's a narrow band of cases in Kansas that require this\nlitigation. There has been a capital murder conviction. The elected law enforcement\nofficial from this county, Mr. [Prosecutor], has decided that twelve well-vetted jurors\nfrom the county where the crime occurred should decide this: What is justice? What is\njustice?\n\n\n           ....\n\n\n           \"The core issue comes down to this: Once the arguments are over, you're in the\njury room, deliberations have begun, the foreperson receives the instructions.\n\n\n           \"The question will become: Abiding by the instructions that you're given,\nconsidering the facts and the circumstances that you have found to exist, each of you will\nhave to ask yourself, what is appropriate justice?\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show . . . a twenty-one year old mother that before the trigger\nwas pulled, and the contents of a PDX round tore through her brain, the evidence will\nshow that she was stripped from the waist down. The evidence will show that she's\nunable to hold those who are around her because her hands are tied, bound behind her\nback.\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that she is unable to verbalize to those who are around\nher because her mouth is gagged. The evidence will show that she is unable to clearly see\nwhat is around her because her glasses have been taken off.\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that all she's left with is this: She can feel, smell, and\nhear. She can feel the carpet on her face. She can feel the air on her naked legs and\nbuttocks. She is breathing the air in that master bedroom. And she is hearing the\nfootsteps, the footsteps of those around her. The words and the sounds of those around\nher. What is appropriate justice? What is appropriate justice?\n\n\n           \"The evidence will show that [K.B.'s] eighteen month old child, [L.B.], standing\nby her dead mother's body. The evidence will show that the trigger was pulled and the\n                                               49\n\f         contents of that PDX round tore through her small torso. What is appropriate justice?\n         What is appropriate justice?\n\n\n                 \"Life without the possibility of parole, imposition of the death penalty? It is for\n         you to decide.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         At the end of the State's pre-rebuttal closing, the prosecutor briefly returned to this\ntheme:\n\n\n                 \"The core issue in this case, abiding by the instructions given to you, considering\n         the facts and the circumstance that you have found to exist. Each of you will have to ask\n         . . . yourself this: What is appropriate justice? What is appropriate justice? A 21 year\n         old mother shot in the back of the head, followed by her 18 month old child shot in the\n         back. You have to make a decision, what is appropriate justice? What is appropriate\n         justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the possibility of parole? That\n         decision is for you to make.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         Flack compares these comments to disapproved prosecutorial appeals to justice\nand sympathy. See, e.g., State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 996-99, 336 P.3d 312 (2014). Flack\nargues \"the prosecutor was clearly asking, 'What is justice for them?'\" The State counters\nhe takes the comments out of context\u2014the prosecutor correctly set forth the penalty\nphase procedures, and he never asked the jury to return a death verdict or argued it would\nbe appropriate. Even so, Flack asserts the comments \"distracted the jury\" from its duty to\ndecide the case on the facts and the law, as given by the judge.\n\n\n         We disagree. In Holt, we determined a prosecutor erred by \"stating that the jury\nhas the 'privilege . . . to right a wrong,' and '[y]ou and only you can right the wrong that\nthe defendant has committed in taking a young man's life.'\" Holt, 300 Kan. at 999. The\nremarks were \"akin to asking the jury to administer justice for the victim\" rather than \"a\ngeneral appeal for justice.\" 300 Kan. at 999. And we noted the prosecutor \"'divert[ed] the\n                                             50\n\fjury from the evidence so as to obtain a conviction based upon sympathy for the victim.'\"\n300 Kan. at 998.\n\n\n       Our pre-Holt caselaw similarly distinguished between a general appeal for justice\nand an appeal for a jury to do justice for the criminal victims, although these cases\ngenerally declined to draw a bright line. See, e.g., State v. Britt, 295 Kan. 1018, 1030-31,\n287 P.3d 905 (2012) (prosecutor's request for the jury to \"'do the right thing, here, find\nhim guilty'\" was \"more aptly characterized as a general appeal for justice that was not\nexplicitly tied to the community or the victim\"); State v. Simmons, 292 Kan. 406, 419,\n254 P.3d 97 (2011) (\"[A] prosecutor commits misconduct during closing argument when,\nin effect, he or she asks the jury to base its deliberations on sympathy for the victim or\nvictim's family or to otherwise argue the impact of a crime on a victim or victim's\nfamily.\"); State v. Martinez, 290 Kan. 992, 1015, 236 P.3d 481 (2010) (prosecutor's\n\"comment urging the jury to tell A.G. 'she did the right thing' by reporting the incident\"\nwas improper \"because it appealed to the jurors' parental instincts and diverted their\nattention from the evidence and the law\"); State v. Nguyen, 285 Kan. 418, 425-26, 172\nP.3d 1165 (2007) (noting a possible \"distinction when the argument is asking for justice\nfor the specific victim\" but speculating that \"[p]erhaps the touchstone is whether the\nargument seeks to divert the jury from the evidence\" with \"sympathy for the victim\"; in\nany event, a prosecutorial request for justice is permissible where \"the prosecutor's\nargument was largely evidence based, notwithstanding an underlying promotion of\nawareness for the victim\" \"coupled with the admonition against sympathy and\nprejudice\"); State v. Ruff, 252 Kan. 625, 631-36, 847 P.2d 1258 (1993) (prosecutorial\nexhortation for the jury to \"'not allow this conduct to be tolerated in our county'\"\nconstituted reversible prosecutorial misconduct).\n\n\n       Likewise, the post-Holt cases continue to recognize potential prosecutorial error\nby improperly eliciting sympathy. See, e.g., State v. Gallegos, 313 Kan. 262, 276, 485\n                                            51\n\fP.3d 622 (2021) (prosecutor's statements permissible because they did not appeal to jury's\nsympathy, did not ask the jury to place itself in the victim's position, and did not ask for\njustice for the victim); Chandler, 307 Kan. at 690 (comment urging for conviction\nbecause \"'she robbed her own children of their father and his fianc[\u00e9e]'\" erroneous). But\nhere, the prosecutor was not arguing for a conviction; the jury already returned a guilty\nverdict. Nor did the prosecutor ever directly ask the jury to return a death sentence or\nsuggest that such a sentence was appropriate.\n\n\n       Indeed, the prosecutor began opening arguments with the facially neutral\nstatement that \"twelve well-vetted jurors from the county where the crime occurred\nshould decide this: What is justice?\" And the prosecutor concluded his pre-rebuttal\nclosing on a similar open-ended note: \"You have to make a decision, what is appropriate\njustice? What is appropriate justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the\npossibility of parole? That decision is for you to make.\" Flack's prosecutor did not ask for\njustice for the victims\u2014he acceptably told the jurors their job was to determine a just\nsentence.\n\n\nMental health treatment and family healing\n\n\n       Flack next argues the prosecutor erred by commenting on facts outside the\nevidence when he \"implied to the jury\" Flack would receive mental health treatment and\nhis family \"would be 'healed' if he were sentenced to death.\" Flack asserts no evidence\nshows that. But these characterizations are not entirely accurate:\n\n\n               \"Over this time you've seen the sadness. Sadness can also be healing, healing.\n       Because there's something about a case like this that when you expose bad things to the\n       light, there's healing. There's healing.\n\n\n\n                                                  52\n\f               \"You know, for the healing for the Flack family, that can occur whether there's\n       the long journey towards execution or the long journey towards natural death. That\n       healing doesn't stop with whatever your decision is. And during that journey hopefully\n       Mr. Flack will get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health issues.\"\n\n\n       \"A prosecutor is prohibited from arguing facts not in evidence, but generally has\nwide latitude to make arguments based on reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented at trial.\" State v. Novotny, 297 Kan. 1174, 1189, 307 P.3d 1278 (2013). Here,\nFlack advances little argument beyond pointing to the statements themselves and offering\nconclusions, and he cites just one case, Chandler, 307 Kan. 657. But in Chandler, a\nprosecutor committed reversible error when she told the jury a nonexistent protection\nfrom abuse order had been filed against the defendant and repeatedly hammered that\nfabricated fact during her closing. 307 Kan. at 678-84. That case hardly supports Flack.\n\n\n       Flack's characterizations are overstated. First, the prosecutor's mental health\ncomments presented only hope and desire, not fact, when he said, \"[H]opefully Mr. Flack\nwill get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health.\" (Emphasis added.) He\ndid not tell the jury Flack would receive mental health treatment, nor did he even suggest\nit was likely. And as the State points out, the record supports a reasonable inference that\nmental health treatment might be available based on testimony Flack previously received\nit in jail and prison. Second, the prosecutor's statements about Flack's family did not\npromise healing, just that whatever healing they may experience would happen during\n\"the long journey towards execution or . . . natural death\" and that \"healing doesn't stop\"\nno matter the jury's decision. At most, this statement tried to convince the jury that\nsympathy for Flack's family should not weigh heavily in its deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold neither statement was erroneous. The prosecutor did not impermissibly\nstate facts outside of evidence during closing.\n\n                                                   53\n\fSelf-reference as \"seasoned prosecutor\" and suggesting, \"If not this case, what case?\"\n\n       Finally, Flack claims the prosecutor improperly bolstered himself as a \"seasoned\nprosecutor\" and offered his opinion that this case warranted the death penalty. The State\ncounters the prosecutor properly requested jurors determine an appropriate sentence\ngiven the facts, instructions, and weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The\nprosecutor said:\n\n\n               \"I ask you to take [Defense]'s argument into consideration. And I hope after all\n       this that the attorneys in this case have represented our professional best.\n\n\n               \"At the end of it, it comes down to what is justice? What is justice? Taking into\n       account all of the instructions, abiding by those instructions, looking at all the facts and\n       circumstances you found to exist.\n\n\n               \"There is a dead 21 year old mother shot in the back of the head, bound and\n       gagged with her 18 month old daughter in that room. Then there's that 18 month old\n       daughter that is shot in the back. These cases are difficult on everyone. The question is,\n       what is justice for that scenario? For the facts and circumstances that you've seen here,\n       what is justice?\n\n\n               \"The State of Kansas, the death penalty. If not this case, what case?\"\n\n\n       Our law is clear: In the context of witness credibility, a prosecutor expressing an\nopinion is a form of unsworn, unchecked testimony rather than commentary on the\nevidence. State v. Pabst, 268 Kan. 501, 510, 996 P.2d 321 (2000). This tracks Rule 3.4(e)\nof the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct: \"A lawyer shall not . . . state a personal\nopinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil\n\n\n\n                                                    54\n\flitigant or the guilt or innocence of an accused.\" KRPC 3.4(e) (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at\n394).\n\n\n        Flack mischaracterizes the nature and intent of the prosecutor's words. First, while\nthe prosecutor mentioned his experience as a \"seasoned prosecutor,\" he did so during voir\ndire and penalty-phase closing. During voir dire, the prosecutor asked one of the panels if\nanyone was nervous. When three of the six raised their hands, he said, \"[A]s you can tell\nby the color of my hair, I'm a seasoned prosecutor and I've handled capital murder death\npenalty cases before, also homicide cases, but I still get nervous.\" This statement's\npurpose was simply to relax nervous jurors.\n\n\n        Second, the prosecutor used the phrase \"seasoned prosecutor\" during the penalty-\nphase closing colloquially to remark on his age, not to tell jurors to trust his judgment\nover their own. After discussing the weighing process instruction, he said, \"So you know,\nat this point as a prosecutor and as you can see I'm a seasoned prosecutor, been around\nawhile. I usually . . . zoom back in to the key place.\" Here, the \"key place\" was the master\nbedroom where the bodies were found. But the prosecutor really wanted \"to zoom in on\nthe courtroom,\" calling for the jurors to consider the presented facts and law.\n\n\n        Neither statement related to his separate query, \"If not this case, what case?\"\nduring penalty-phase closing. The logical leap is too large to conclude combining these\nunrelated statements told the jury the prosecutor had seen a lot of cases and felt this one\nwas deathworthy. His comments were made far apart and separately. Their combined\neffect was not error.\n\n\n        That said, it is possible the \"if not this case\" comment alone is error. As Flack\npoints out, at least two other jurisdictions have held similar comments to be error. The\n\n\n                                              55\n\fOklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals disapproved of a problematic prosecutor who had\nrun afoul of the court:\n\n\n       \"[T]he prosecutor improperly pleaded with the jury to do justice 'and the only way you\n       can do that is bring back a sentence of death.' He also told the jury 'If this isn't a death\n       penalty case, what is?' It is error for a prosecutor . . . state his personal opinion as to the\n       appropriateness of the death penalty.\" (Emphasis added.) Torres v. State, 962 P.2d 3, 18\n       (Okla. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n\n       Although Torres does not give more context for the nearly identical statement, the\ncourt ultimately ruled the statement along with the prosecutor's other errors were\nharmless. 962 P.2d at 18.\n\n\n       Flack's second case, stemming from a Missouri habeas corpus petition, required\nvacating the defendant's death sentence. There, the prosecutor spoke his opinion:\n\n\n       \"I've been a prosecutor for ten years and I've never asked a jury for a death penalty, but I\n       can tell you in all candor, I've never seen a man who deserved it more than [the\n       defendant]. By returning your verdict in this case . . . that either means that you believe\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that he pulled the trigger, or that he had the frame of mind\n       that's consistent with pulling the trigger, and I submit to you, that [the defendant] did pull\n       the trigger, and didn't pull it once, but pulled it twice\u2014executed an innocent man in cold\n       blood.\n\n\n                \"So, where do we go from there? I say to you that I never saw a man who\n       deserved it more and I say that to you in complete sincerity, and it's my job, as I see it, to\n       tell you that.\" Newlon v. Armontrout, 693 F. Supp. 799, 804 (W.D. Mo. 1988), aff'd 885\n       F.2d 1328 (8th Cir. 1989).\n\n\n\n\n                                                      56\n\f       The Newlon court held the prosecutor discussing declining to seek the death\npenalty until this case was improper, especially when the death penalty statutes were\nunconstitutional for much of that period. Newlon, 693 F. Supp. at 804-05. The Newlon\nprosecutor continued that theme but added several more erroneous statements. He\nemphasized he was the \"'top law enforcement officer of the [c]ounty,'\" compared the\ndefendant to infamous mass-murderers, personalized analogies to jurors defending their\nown children, referenced war and courage, insinuated all murder should be punished with\ndeath, and reassured jurors appellate review follows any death sentence. 693 F. Supp. at\n808. In combination, the jury faced a \"relentless, focused, uncorrected argument based on\nfear, premised on facts not in evidence, and calculated to remove reason and\nresponsibility from the sentencing process.\" 693 F. Supp. at 808.\n\n\n       By contrast, the prosecutorial remark here, taken in context, permissibly and\nsimply requested jurors to accurately perform their jobs by following their instructions.\nThe prosecutor did not commit error.\n\n\n            HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS, OR CRUEL AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n\n       The State charged Flack with capital murder based on the \"intentional and\npremeditated killing of more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in\ntwo or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct.\" K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-5401(a)(6). The instruction for\ncapital murder required the jury to find Flack \"purposefully killed [K.B.] and L.B.\" The\nState's notice of intent to seek the death penalty included the aggravator: \"The defendant,\nas to [K.B.], committed the crime in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner\"\nfollowing K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-6624(f)'s exact language. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\f       Flack argues the heinous manner aggravator is limited to \"the crime,\" while the\nversion of capital murder he was convicted of required multiple killings, so the State had\nto allege and prove he killed both K.B. and L.B. in a heinous manner. We disagree. The\nstatutory scheme does not require this.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       To the extent this issue requires statutory interpretation, it presents a question of\nlaw subject to unlimited review. If the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, we\napply the language as written. State v. Dinkel, 314 Kan. 146, 155, 495 P.3d 402 (2021).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       Flack equates the State's notice of intent to seek the death penalty with a charging\ndocument. He cites State v. Dunn, 304 Kan. 773, 375 P.3d 332 (2016), to support his\nclaim the State needed to \"charge\" the heinous aggravator as to both K.B. and L.B. In\nDunn, we identified \"three possible types of charging document insufficiency a criminal\ndefendant may challenge.\" 304 Kan. at 815. First, a charging document must meet \"the\nKansas constitutional minimums of correct court and correct territory.\" 304 Kan. at\n815. Second, it must allege \"facts about the intent and action on the part of the defendant\nthat, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, would constitute violation of a Kansas\ncriminal statute.\" 304 Kan. at 815. Third, it must satisfy \"federal and state constitutional\nstandards for due process and notice, such that the defendant has an opportunity to meet\nand answer the State's evidence and prevent double jeopardy.\" 304 Kan. at 815. The type\nof deficiency determines the available remedies for each. 304 Kan. at 816-17.\n\n\n       Flack argues his claim falls within the second and third categories: The State\n\"failed to state facts that constitute a Kansas crime\" and \"the defective charge denied\n                                               58\n\f[him] due process.\" Before discussing Dunn, and what it means here, we note the process\nfor pursuing the death penalty differs from charging the underlying crime of capital\nmurder. That distinction is critical to understanding Dunn's limitations.\n\n\n       In setting the second category's framework\u2014charging the underlying crime of\ncapital murder\u2014the Dunn court noted K.S.A. 22-3201(b) requires a charging document\nto \"state 'essential facts' constituting the crime charged.\" 304 Kan. at 811. The statute\nemphasizes \"'facts' rather than 'elements.'\" 304 Kan. at 811. \"A Kansas charging\ndocument should be regarded as sufficient . . . when it has alleged facts that would\nestablish the defendant's commission of a crime recognized in Kansas.\" 304 Kan. at 811-\n12.\n\n\n       To determine whether the alleged facts constitute a Kansas crime, we use the\ncrime's statutory definition to determine if the factual allegations, if proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, would justify a guilty verdict. 304 Kan. at 812. The State charged Flack\nunder K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-5401(a)(6) with the \"intentional and premeditated killing of\nmore than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in two or more acts or\ntransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" The capital murder's definition does not include aggravating circumstances.\nThose are instead set forth in the death sentence procedure statutes, applicable only after\nthe State obtains a conviction for capital murder.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(a) governs the State's requirements to give a written\nnotice of its intent to seek the death penalty. If the prosecutor fails to give the notice and\nthe defendant is convicted of capital murder, the sentence will be life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole, and death penalty cannot be imposed. K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 21-6617(a).\n\n\n                                              59\n\f       But the notice of intent is not the State's only obligation. The State must also\nprovide the defendant notice of all aggravating factor evidence it plans to use. See K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-6617(c). Notably, the subsection (c) notice does not need to be provided at\nthe same time as the subsection (a) notice. Kleypas I, 272 Kan. at 979. The Kleypas I\ncourt distinguished between the two notice requirements. The notice of intent allows the\ndefendant to begin their preparation for trial as it serves notice that the case will indeed\nbe a death penalty case, thus allowing them to make choices regarding the retention of\ncounsel, plea bargaining, and preparation of mitigating factors. 272 Kan. at 979-80. On\nthe other hand, the subsection (c) notice permits, but does not require, the State to give\nnotice of aggravating circumstances. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(c) (\"Only such\nevidence of aggravating circumstances as the state has made known to the defendant\nprior to the sentencing proceeding shall be admissible.\"). The State need only give such\nnotice \"within a reasonable time prior to trial to allow the defendant an opportunity to\nprepare to defend against the aggravating circumstances.\" Kleypas I, 272 Kan. at 980.\n\n\n       Flack's claim the State must prove he killed both K.B. and L.B. in a heinous\nmanner does not neatly fit the charging deficiency paradigm under Dunn; it more closely\nresembles an evidence sufficiency claim. The State met both statutory notice\nrequirements about its intent to seek the death penalty and its intended aggravating factor\nevidence. Neither statutes nor caselaw supports such a claim.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624 sets out the aggravating circumstances available for\ncapital murder:\n\n\n              \"(a) The defendant was previously convicted of a felony in which the defendant\n       inflicted great bodily harm, disfigurement, dismemberment or death on another.\n\n\n              \"(b) The defendant knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death\n       to more than one person.\n                                                 60\n\f        \"(c) The defendant committed the crime for the defendant's self or another for the\npurpose of receiving money or any other thing of monetary value.\n\n\n        \"(d) The defendant authorized or employed another person to commit the crime.\n\n\n        \"(e) The defendant committed the crime in order to avoid or prevent a lawful\narrest or prosecution.\n\n\n        \"(f) The defendant committed the crime in an especially heinous, atrocious or\ncruel manner. A finding that the victim was aware of such victim's fate or had conscious\npain and suffering as a result of the physical trauma that resulted in the victim's death is\nnot necessary to find that the manner in which the defendant killed the victim was\nespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel. Conduct which is heinous, atrocious or cruel may\ninclude, but is not limited to:\n\n\n        (1) Prior stalking of or criminal threats to the victim;\n\n\n        (2) preparation or planning, indicating an intention that the killing was meant to\n        be especially heinous, atrocious or cruel;\n\n\n        (3) infliction of mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death;\n\n\n        (4) torture of the victim;\n\n\n        (5) continuous acts of violence begun before or continuing after the killing;\n\n\n        (6) desecration of the victim's body in a manner indicating a particular depravity\n        of mind, either during or following the killing; or\n\n\n        (7) any other conduct the trier of fact expressly finds is especially heinous.\n\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f               \"(g) The defendant committed the crime while serving a sentence of\n       imprisonment on conviction of a felony.\n\n\n               \"(h) The victim was killed while engaging in, or because of the victim's\n       performance or prospective performance of, the victim's duties as a witness in a criminal\n       proceeding.\"\n\n\n       Flack correctly states the heinous manner aggravator applies to \"the crime,\" not\nthe crime's elements, but his conclusion that each killing in a multiple-killing capital\nmurder must have been committed heinously does not necessarily follow.\n\n\n       As readily seen, the aggravating circumstances apply to various subjects\u2014such as\n\"the defendant,\" \"the crime,\" and \"the victim\"\u2014between subsections. Subsection (f)\ndefines the heinous manner aggravator with both \"the crime\" and \"the victim.\" It provides\na nonexhaustive list of circumstances a jury may find heinous including conduct\nconcurrent with the act of killing or conduct not necessarily concurrent with a killing,\nsuch as prior stalking and planning or preparation. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(1)-(2).\nFinally, subsection (f) encompasses a catchall provision of \"any other conduct\" the jury\n\"expressly finds is especially heinous.\" K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(7).\n\n\n       So, rather than requiring the heinous manner aggravator apply to each killing, the\nstatute instead focuses on whether \"the crime\" in total was committed in a heinous\nmanner. Nothing in the statute supports Flack's reading. Under our death penalty scheme,\nany finding of an aggravating circumstance, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances,\nis sufficient to sentence the defendant to death. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e). The\nscheme does not assign weight to the number of aggravating circumstances; the finding\nof such a circumstance merely triggers the weighing process.\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\f       The State alleged the heinous manner circumstance and gave Flack notice about its\nintended evidence to prove the circumstance specifically related to Flack killing K.B.\nImposing a death sentence here did not deprive Flack of due process.\n\n\n    JURY INSTRUCTIONS: SENTENCING PROCEEDING AND DUTY-TO-REACH-VERDICT\n\n\n       Flack challenges two jury instructions from the penalty phase. He argues the first\npenalty-phase instruction that informed jurors a guilty verdict would be followed by a\nseparate sentencing proceeding erroneously implied the jury would not be responsible for\nsentencing. He also contests the verdict form alleging it told jurors they had to reach a\nunanimous decision to give him a life sentence.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review jury instructions under a three-step framework. First, we determine if\nthe issue was properly preserved below. Second, we consider the claim's merits to decide\nwhether error occurred below. At this step, we consider if the challenged instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate. We exercise unlimited review of the entire record and\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the requesting party. Finally, if there was\nerror, we examine if the error was harmless. State v. Gleason, 305 Kan. 794, 800-01, 388\nP.3d 101 (2017); Kleypas II, 305 Kan. at 305-06.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       The first instruction told the jury that \"when a defendant has been found guilty of\ncapital murder, a separate sentencing proceeding shall be conducted to determine whether\nthe defendant shall be sentenced to death.\" (Emphasis added.) At trial, Flack requested to\n\n\n                                             63\n\freplace \"shall\" with \"may\" because it implies \"the jury was not ultimately responsible\nfor\" sentencing. The court declined, and before us Flack raises the argument again.\n\n\n       There may be a grain of truth to Flack's claim in that a penalty phase is not needed\nif the State does not seek the death penalty. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(a) (requiring\nthe State give written notice within seven days of arraignment it intends to seek the death\npenalty). Otherwise, a person convicted of capital murder receives a life sentence. But his\ndesired language misstates the law because a person can only be sentenced to death if a\njury makes the necessary findings. Changing \"shall\" to \"may\" could lead the jury to\nbelieve the State had another procedural option to obtain a death sentence, and \"the\nuncorrected suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will\nrest with others presents an intolerable danger.\" Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320,\n333, 105 S. Ct. 2633, 86 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1985).\n\n\n       Whether a separate sentencing proceeding happens in every capital case or only\nafter the State decides to pursue that option, the given instruction here fairly stated the\nlaw and did not mislead the jury.\n\n\n       Next, at the penalty phase's conclusion, the court instructed the jury on completing\nthe verdict form, explaining, \"[I]f one or more jurors are not persuaded beyond a\nreasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating\ncircumstances, then you shall sign the appropriate alternative verdict form indicating the\njury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict sentencing the defendant to death.\"\n(Emphasis added.) The verdict form provided two options: (1) the standard and\nnecessary findings to impose a death sentence with space to note applicable aggravating\nfactors, and (2) \"We, the jury . . . state that we are unable to reach a unanimous verdict\nsentencing the defendant to death.\" (Emphasis added.) Over Flack's objection the \"unable\n\n\n                                              64\n\fto\" language implied jurors must reach a unanimous verdict for or against the death\nsentence, the court declined to replace \"unable\" with \"did not.\"\n\n\n        His suggested language advances a novel reading of the death penalty sentencing\nstatutes. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e) provides:\n\n\n                \"If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or\n        more of the aggravating circumstances . . . exist and, further, that the existence of such\n        aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are\n        found to exist, the defendant shall be sentenced to death; otherwise, the defendant shall\n        be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The jury, if its verdict is a\n        unanimous recommendation of a sentence of death, shall designate in writing, signed by\n        the foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstances which it found beyond a\n        reasonable doubt. If, after a reasonable time for deliberation, the jury is unable to reach\n        a verdict, the judge shall dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of life without the\n        possibility of parole.\" (Emphases added.)\n\n\n        According to Flack, the third sentence conflicts with the first. He argues,\n\"Sentence one says that the inability to agree is a life verdict; sentence three seems to say\nthe inability to agree is not a verdict at all.\" But even if Flack's suggested conflict exists,\nhis preferred interpretation does not materially differ from the Kleypas I court's\nunderstanding of the statute. In Kleypas I, the court held a sentencing verdict form\nstating, \"'We, the jury . . . unanimously determine that a sentence as provided by law be\nimposed by the Court,'\" misled the jury it must reach a unanimous verdict. Kleypas I, 272\nKan. at 1062. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617's predecessor \"does not require the jury to\nunanimously conclude that a death sentence is unwarranted in order to sentence the\ndefendant to a punishment other than death; rather, the jury must only fail to unanimously\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a death sentence is warranted.\" 272 Kan. at\n1062.\n\n                                                      65\n\f       Flack correctly notes the jury is not under a duty to reach a unanimous verdict, but\nhe fails to establish the given instruction might lead jurors to believe such a duty existed.\nThe instruction and verdict form accurately state the law and could not have misled the\njury. See State v. Sims, 308 Kan. 1488, 1505, 431 P.3d 288 (2018) (jury instructions\nreviewed \"together as a whole,\" not in isolation). The instruction informed the jury the\nsentence would be life without parole if it could not reach a verdict, and the verdict form\nprovided an option to state it could not reach a unanimous verdict of death. Nothing\nimplied it must reach a unanimous decision to impose a life sentence.\n\n\n                            EIGHTH AMENDMENT CHALLENGE\n\n\n       Flack raises a categorical Eighth Amendment challenge to his death sentence, even\nthough he acknowledges we recently addressed and rejected nearly identical claims in\nKleypas II, 305 Kan. at 328, 337, and State v. Kahler, 307 Kan. 374, 406, 409, 410 P.3d\n105 (2018). In both cases, counsel compared the mentally ill to intellectually disabled\npeople to establish they are less culpable for their crimes. Flack reiterates those\narguments without adding anything materially different from prior cases, so Kleypas II\ncontrols. We see no reason to revisit its holding.\n\n\n            SECTIONS 1 AND 5 OF THE KANSAS CONSTITUTION BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n\n       Flack challenges the death penalty's constitutionality under section 1 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. We addressed the same issue in State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 615,\n625-26, 502 P.3d 546 (2022) (R. Carr II), and State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 744, 753, 502 P.3d\n511 (2022). In those cases, we characterized the argument as contending \"section 1\nprotects the right to life, and Kansas' capital sentencing scheme unconstitutionally\n\n\n                                             66\n\finfringes upon this right.\" R. Carr II, 314 Kan. at 627. We rejected that argument,\nholding:\n\n\n               \"The historical record reflects the framers did not intend the term 'inalienable' in\n       section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights to be construed as 'absolute' and\n       'nonforfeitable.' Instead, a careful reading of section 1, coupled with the transcripts of the\n       convention debate, demonstrates that the term 'inalienable' refers only to one's ability to\n       transfer his or her right or interest to another person. Though inalienable, the framers\n       viewed the natural rights guaranteed within this section to be forfeitable in civil society.\n       So construed, the framers did not intend for section 1 to impede or limit the State's\n       authority to punish individuals for their criminal conduct.\" 314 Kan. 615, Syl. \u00b6 4.\n\n\n       Additionally, Flack attacked the death penalty under section 5 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. R. Carr II also addressed that issue, as a \"constitutional\nchallenge to the practice of 'death qualifying' juries in Kansas\u2014the process of removing\nprospective jurors for cause . . . when their conscientious objection to capital punishment\nsubstantially impairs their ability to fulfill the oath and obligations of a juror.\" 314 Kan.\nat 645. We rejected that argument, holding:\n\n\n       \"[B]oth the plain meaning and historical record confirm that a 'jury' is defined as a group\n       comprised of persons who will determine issues of fact and return a decision based on the\n       evidence and in accordance with the law as instructed. Death qualification . . . removes\n       only those prospective jurors who cannot fulfill these obligations due to conscientious\n       objection to the death penalty, i.e., the statute authorizes removal of those prospective\n       jurors excluded from the constitutional definition of a 'jury.' Thus, death qualification\n       facilitates the very jury trial right guaranteed by section 5. Moreover, when the Kansas\n       Constitution was adopted in 1859, the common law did not preclude, and in fact\n       authorized, this procedure. For these reasons, we hold that death qualification under\n       K.S.A. 22-3410 does not violate section 5.\" 314 Kan. at 653.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    67\n\f       Flack offers no new authority or argument warranting revisiting of R. Carr II.\n\n\n                                    CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n\n       Based on our rulings, the cumulative error doctrine has no application. State v.\nSieg, 315 Kan. 526, 536, 509 P.3d 535 (2022).\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm Flack's convictions and sentence. No errors warrant reversal of his\nconvictions or sentence. We conclude \"the evidence supports the findings that\" one or\nmore aggravating circumstances \"existed and that any mitigating circumstances were\ninsufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\" See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-\n6619(c)(2). We also conclude the jury imposed the death sentence without \"the influence\nof passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\" See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(c)(1).\n\n\n                                             ***\n\n\n       STEGALL, J., concurring: I concur with the majority's decision to affirm Flack's\nconvictions and sentence. I depart, however, from the majority's application of section 1\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights in the death penalty context. In my view, our\ncourt continues to be wrong by declaring that criminal defendants have no protections\nunder section 1. See State v. Carr, 314 Kan. 744, 782-83, 502 P.3d 511 (2022) (Stegall,\nJ., concurring) (\"[T]he majority makes it explicit that a criminal defendant has no section\n1 protections at all. Indeed, according to the majority, 'the state's power to punish' is\nlimited only by 'due process' and 'cruel or unusual' provisions which 'do not arise under\nsection 1.'\"), cert. denied 143 S. Ct. 584 (2023).\n\n\n                                              68\n\f       Instead, I have consistently argued that properly understood, section 1 provides a\nsubstantive check on the police power of the state\u2014including the power to kill its own\ncitizens. See Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Schmidt, 309 Kan. 610, 742, 440 P.3d 461\n(2019) (Stegall, J., dissenting). To effectuate that check on state police power, I\narticulated the judicial test\u2014rooted in our history and precedent\u2014courts should apply to\nany section 1 challenge. 309 Kan. at 767 (Stegall, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       But here, as in Carr, \"[t]he lower courts have not inquired into the [police power\ntest], the parties have not briefed the issue, and this court has declined to take it up.\"\nCarr, 314 Kan. at 783 (Stegall, J., concurring). It is true that Flack has at least gestured\ntoward applying the appropriate section 1 police power test I set forth in Hodes. But he\nhas not made any substantive argument beyond a few conclusory statements, and the\nrecord below is entirely void of any findings that might support his claim. In a future\ncase, I am open to considering the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty under\nsection 1's limit on state police powers. But doing so would require an actual showing\nbased on something more substantial than Flack has provided to demonstrate that our\ndeath penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance of the common good.\n\n\n       So as before, given \"the monumental consequences of the state's exercise of this\nmost final, most irreversible, and most grave use of power\u2014killing a human person\u2014I\nam left with a profound and unshakable disquiet about our court's blessing upon these\nprocedures.\" 314 Kan. at 783 (Stegall, J., concurring). And because I cannot \"presume\nour death penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance or protection of the common\ngood\u2014or that it is otherwise arbitrary, irrational, or discriminatory . . . I am left with no\noption other than to concur in the judgment.\" 314 Kan. at 784 (Stegall, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                              69\n\f                                             ***\n\n\n       WILSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: The majority finds\nambiguity in Kyle Flack's many attempts to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence\nduring his interview with police in the early morning hours of May 8, 2013. I cannot\nagree. Taken collectively, I would hold Flack's final four statements constitute an\nunequivocal invocation of his right to silence\u2014an invocation which his interrogators\nfailed to scrupulously honor. Because I view the admission of Flack's post-invocation\nstatements to be prejudicial to his convictions for the murders of Andrew Stout and\nSteven White, I would reverse those convictions and remand for a new trial. And while I\nbelieve the evidence of Flack's guilt for his capital murder charge was robust enough to\nprevent reversal of that conviction, I cannot conclude that the admission of Flack's\nstatements was harmless as to his sentence of death. Thus, for the reasons below, I\nrespectfully concur in part in the result and dissent in part.\n\n\n       Our test here is ostensibly an objective one: \"whether a reasonable police officer\nunder the circumstances would understand the suspect's statement as an assertion of a\nMiranda right.\" State v. Aguirre, 301 Kan. 950, 957, 349 P.3d 1245 (2015). As the\nmajority notes, despite Flack's failure to frame this issue under the right to silence at trial,\nwe can still consider it under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(b). Slip op. at 14-15. Further,\neven without testimony on the specifics of Flack's statements, the record before us\ncontains the best evidence available in the form of the interview video. We know the time\nand place of this interview; we can assess for ourselves Flack's tone and manner, as well\nas the detectives' varied responses to his at-issue statements.\n\n\n       More importantly, the facts before us also reveal that the investigators' key\nconcern in the interview was \"finding [L.B.],\" who was still missing then and might\u2014for\n                                           70\n\fall they knew then\u2014still have been alive. This concern can be readily divined from\ninterviewers' questions themselves: the first thing Alexander asked Flack was \"if he\nknew where [L.B.] was located.\"\n\n\n       I mention this not because the officers' subjective understanding of Flack's\nstatements matters to our analysis\u2014it does not\u2014but to provide context for their\nresponses to those statements. To put a finer point on it, their uncertainty over L.B.'s fate\nquashed all incentive for the detectives to treat any statement as an invocation of the right\nto silence. In other words, the detectives effectively wore blinders of incomprehension\nwhen presented with Flack's repeated statements because they wanted to prolong the\ninterview; they wanted Flack's statements to be ambiguous.\n\n\n       This is why the detectives' subjective understanding of Flack's invocations is, and\nmust be, irrelevant to whether Flack invoked his right to silence. Anyone can appreciate\nthe detectives' concern for finding L.B. For all they knew at the beginning of the\ninterview, she might still have been alive, and Flack might have been the key to bringing\nher to safety. But as an appellate court, we must concentrate on the statements Flack\nmade and on whether a reasonable officer would understand that Flack was exercising his\nconstitutional right to stop the inquiry by invoking his right to remain silent. The officers'\nunderstandable concern for L.B. does not lessen their responsibility to Flack. But this\nconcern necessarily colors the detectives' responses to Flack's statements, including the\nalleged invocations here. Thus, we must consider what Flack said\u2014and the\ncircumstances in which he said it\u2014to conclude whether a reasonable officer would have\nunderstood him to be invoking his right to silence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\f       Flack's final four statements, collectively, were clear and unequivocal.\n\n\n       Flack points to several statements as attempted invocations of his right to silence. I\nagree with the majority that most of Flack's earlier statements were ambiguous for the\nreasons discussed in the majority opinion. Slip op. at 16-19. But I cannot agree that\nFlack's final four \"take me to jail\" statements\u2014the ones the majority labels as Flack's\nseventh through tenth\u2014were ambiguous. Slip op. at 19-22. Among other possible\ninterpretations, the majority suggests that, \"In context, these comments show Flack\nbelieved the questioning about what happened at Stout's house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right.\" Slip op. at 22. It further reads Flack's statements as\nshowing that Flack \"simply claimed the detectives had already made up their minds about\nhis involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help them find the\nchild\"\u2014and, thus, Flack was not invoking his right to silence. Slip op. at 22.\n\n\n       But while the cold words of the transcript may lend credence to the majority's\nposition that Flack might have meant any number of things, the way Flack said them\u2014\nalong with their repetition\u2014clarifies any ambiguity, in my view. And although an\nappellate opinion cannot entirely convey the nuanced audiovisual information presented\nin the videos of Flack's interrogation, that information is at least as important in\nestablishing the context and meaning of Flack's words as the words themselves. To\nclarify the basis for my dissent, then, a bit of additional description is needed.\n\n\n       As the majority notes, Flack made his final four \"take me to jail\" comments during\na portion of questioning about the identities of his violent, drug-related contacts in\nEmporia. Slip op. at 19-22. At first, as the detective began to explore Flack's involvement\nwith these contacts, Flack abruptly said, \"Take me to jail,\" and looked down at his lap.\nThe detective asked a question. Flack did not respond, but only said, \"Take me to jail.\"\nThe detective asked another question. Flack again only said, \"Take me to jail.\" This time,\n                                           72\n\fthere was silence for several seconds. At this point, I believe Flack's intent to invoke his\nright to remain silent became clear. Even so, the detectives again asked more questions.\nAfter answering a couple of them, Flack again said, \"Take me to jail.\" This time he\ncrossed his arms and put his head down on the table. He clearly wanted to stop the\ninterview.\n\n\n       The worst of Flack's self-incriminating statements followed.\n\n\n       These last four statements of, \"Take me to jail,\" lacked some of the accompanying\nphrases held elsewhere to render similar statements ambiguous, and their exact repetition\nin the face of several different questions underscored what was, in my view, a clear intent\nto cut off the interview. Cf. People v. Jackson, 1 Cal. 5th 269, 336-41, 205 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n386, 376 P.3d 528 (2016) (\"Man just take me to jail man. I don't wanna talk no more,\"\nwas clear and unambiguous.); State v. Jang, 359 N.J. Super. 85, 90, 819 A.2d 9 (App.\nDiv. 2003) (Defendant's statement, \"'I don't want to talk anymore. Take me to jail,'\"\nterminated the interview.). Any alternative interpretations of these statements strains\ncredulity, in my view: if Flack meant anything besides \"take me to jail,\" he would have\nsaid as much during one of his repetitions of the phrase. That he did not crystalizes the\nclear and unambiguous meaning of his words and their necessary implication: terminate\nthe interview by taking him to jail. Unlike the majority, I thus believe Flack's statements\ncollectively made his meaning clear. I cannot support the majority's speculation as to\nFlack's meaning, that is, that he was merely expressing his belief about the irrelevance of\nthe detectives' line of questioning.\n\n\n       The State claims that Flack's earlier, ambiguous responses taint the meaning of his\nlater ones. But we have soundly rejected such arguments in the past, and I would do so\nagain here. Cf. State v. Walker, 304 Kan. 441, 456, 372 P.3d 1147 (2016) (earlier\nambiguous statements did not undermine the clarity of a later set of statements that\n                                         73\n\f\"[c]ollectively . . . would have made it clear to reasonable law enforcement officers\" that\na suspect was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to silence). As I have written, Flack's\nwords\u2014and, perhaps more critically, how he said them\u2014rendered his meaning perfectly\nclear to a reasonable officer.\n\n\n       The majority also finds ambiguity in two of Flack's responses\u2014\"What do you\nwant me to tell you?\" and, \"I don't know the fuckin' people\"\u2014which, the majority,\nclaims, \"lead to a reasonable inference Flack meant 'I don't know,' rather than invoking\nhis right to remain silent.\" Slip op. at 21-22. But the majority's reliance on these\nstatements is flawed. Flack made the first statement between his ninth and tenth\nattempted invocations, and he made the second one after his tenth and final attempted\ninvocation. Slip op. at 21-22. In my view, Flack had already made his meaning clear, at\nthe very latest, by his ninth overall statement: the penultimate \"take me to jail\" comment.\nStatements made after an invocation cannot be used to retroactively \"cast doubt on the\nadequacy\" of that invocation, as the majority attempts to do now. E.g., Smith v. Illinois,\n469 U.S. 91, 98-99, 105 S. Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1984). \"In other words, if the\ninterrogators simply ignore the suspect's invocation of rights and continue to ask\nquestions, the suspect's compliance with the further questioning does not invalidate or\nrender equivocal the prior invocation of rights.\" Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 958. Thus, I am\ntroubled by the majority's efforts to retroactively interpret Flack's \"take me to jail\"\nstatements by relying on his later responses.\n\n\n       In evaluating the clarity of an alleged invocation of the right to silence, words\nmatter. Context matters. Magic words are not required. Emspak v. United States, 349 U.S.\n190, 194, 75 S. Ct. 687, 99 L. Ed. 997 (1955). When we speak of what a \"reasonable\nofficer\" would have understood, we are referring to an individual of ordinary intelligence\npossessed of ordinary linguistic comprehension skills. We are not speaking of individuals\nwho, for one reason or another, can apply the principles of arcane philosophies and\n                                            74\n\flexical sophistry to divine ambiguity where, in any ordinary conversation, there would be\nnone. A reasonable officer is not one motivated to find ambiguity no matter where or how\nhis goal finds quarter. This latter category naturally includes professional investigators\nwho may be motivated to remain, and thus do remain in the face of all evidence to the\ncontrary, doggedly \"uncertain\" about a suspect's meaning\u2014particularly those guided by\nthe best of intentions, such as the urgent need to locate a missing child and bring her\nsafely home. See, e.g., Sadeghi, Hung Up on Semantics: A Critique of Davis v. United\nStates, 23 Hastings Const. L.Q. 313, 336 (1995) (\"Perhaps the most troubling aspect of\nthe threshold-of-clarity approach is that it leaves the fox guarding the henhouse. The\npolice have little incentive to find that a statement was a clear invocation of rights.\").\n\n\n       Yet law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and courts alike have shown over and\nover their own mastery of speculative mental gymnastics where a suspect may be\ninvoking the right to silence or the right to counsel, but not \"clearly so.\" See generally 2\nLaFave, Israel, King & Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(g), n.184-85 (4th ed.) (cataloging\nmany cases finding ambiguity in \"even a statement which itself appears to amount to an\nassertion of the right to remain silent\"\u2014including the outright refusal to speak). Nor do\ncourts consider silence itself\u2014which a layperson might reasonably view as perhaps the\npurest indication that a suspect is invoking the right to silence\u2014to be a clear and\nunambiguous invocation of the right to silence. E.g., Evans v. Demosthenes, 902 F. Supp.\n1253, 1259-60 (D. Nev. 1995), aff'd 98 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 1996). Some of these\nexercises in linguistic contortionism pass beyond the point of parody. See, e.g., State v.\nDemesme, 228 So. 3d 1206, 1206-07 (La. 2017) (Crichton, J., concurring) (finding\nambiguity in the phrase \"'if y'all, this is how I feel, if y'all think I did it, I know that I\ndidn't do it so why don't you just give me a lawyer dog cause this is not what's up'\"\nbecause \"the defendant's ambiguous and equivocal reference to a 'lawyer dog' does not\nconstitute an invocation of counsel that warrants termination of the interview\").\n\n\n                                                75\n\f       Thus, despite the ostensibly objective, non-talismanic standard we purport to\napply, \"On the whole, courts have set a high threshold for explicit invocation, but it\nremains unclear what exactly a suspect must say or do to explicitly invoke silence.\"\nRushin, Rethinking Miranda: The Post-Arrest Right to Silence, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 151, 168\n(2011). One is forced to wonder, despite a plethora of caselaw to the contrary, whether\nmagic words are required, and even whether the magic words must be followed with\nactual silence before a suspect clearly and unambiguously invokes the right to silence\nunder the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Gee, Invoking the Right to Counsel and Right to\nRemain Silent: It's Just Not That Clear, 32 Miss. C. L. Rev. 69, 81-82 (2013) (\"As the\nerosion of Miranda continues with each subsequent Supreme Court term, the limitations\nplaced on both ambiguous requests for counsel under Davis and the right to silence under\nBerghuis seem destined to remain in place, or perhaps become even more narrow.\"). The\nvery meaning of the words \"clearly and unambiguously\" strains, cracks, and sometimes\nbreaks under the burden we place upon it. This case exemplifies this deterioration.\n\n\n       In other areas of police investigation, courts often give weight\u2014if not total\ndeference\u2014to an officer's deductions, instincts, training, and experience. See, e.g., State\nv. Cash, 313 Kan. 121, 133, 483 P.3d 1047 (2021) (\"deference\" given to officer's\ntestimony that \"in her training and experience a Crown Royal bag 'more often than not'\ncontains drug paraphernalia\" for purposes of reasonable suspicion); State v. Jones, 300\nKan. 630, 647-48, 333 P.3d 886 (2014) (recognizing \"some deference\" to an officer's\ntraining and experience in assessing reasonable suspicion based on suspicious driving,\nbut still agreeing \"with the district judge that the officer acted on a hunch, not reasonable\nsuspicion\"); State v. Moore, 283 Kan. 344, 359-60, 154 P.3d 1 (2007) (giving\n\"appropriate deference to the opinions of a particular law enforcement officer on the\nscene who, with thousands of traffic stops, is highly experienced in roadside searches and\nseizures and determinations of reasonable suspicion\" while cautioning against \"a total, or\nsubstantial, deference to law enforcement's opinion concerning the presence of\n                                            76\n\freasonable suspicion\"); State v. Wonders, 263 Kan. 582, 598, 600, 952 P.2d 1351 (1998)\n(trial court considered officer's training and experience in finding probable cause to\nbelieve a bulge in a suspect's pocket was marijuana, but recognizing \"that experienced,\nknowledgeable law enforcement officers know the 'magic words' to be related when their\nsearches and seizures are challenged\"). Yet in the arena of the Fifth Amendment, courts\nconstructively infantilize officers by imputing to them a basic lack of language\ncomprehension. Moreover, our legal framework provides little incentive for officers to\nexercise caution in the face of a possible invocation\u2014anything besides a precise\nrecitation of some court-approved legal formula. After all, if a court can divine any\nambiguity at all in a suspect's statements, it will reward an officer's constructive\n\"uncertainty\" over any language that does not contain a precise invocation incantation. In\nother words, we have created a system under which officers have little reason not to\ngamble by refusing to scrupulously honor an invocation\u2014unless, that is, it is expressed\nthrough a set of specific legal magic words.\n\n\n       Here, a reasonable detective could not have understood Flack's repeated identical\n\"take me to jail\" statements to mean anything besides a request to terminate the interview\nand \"take [him] to jail.\" The majority's alternative view\u2014that Flack's responses could be\ninterpreted as merely bemoaning the futility of the detectives' line of questioning\u2014\nappears strained to me. \"We should not seek ambiguity where none exists\" to sanction\ndetectives' continued questioning in the face of an invocation of the right to silence. Cf.\nU. S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. W. Cas. & Sur. Co., 195 Kan. 603, 605, 408 P.2d 596 (1965)\n(refusing to invoke the rule of liberal construction when an insurance policy used\nunambiguous language). Flack repeated his precise request to be taken to jail over and\nover; I cannot view such exact repetition as anything other than an attempt to terminate\nthe conversation.\n\n\n\n                                               77\n\f       Thus, in my view, Flack did what he needed to do to invoke his right to silence\nunder the Fifth Amendment. An invocation need not be perfect\u2014and Flack's was not\u2014\nbut Flack's meaning should have been clear to his interviewers all the same. The\ndetectives failed to scrupulously honor that invocation, and thus the district court erred in\nfailing to suppress his statements.\n\n\n       This failure also extends to the statements Flack made during the second\ninterview, which the prosecution used to develop its theory of the case. As we have said,\n\n\n               \"Based on Miranda and [Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L.\n       Ed. 2d 313 (1975)], if a defendant invokes his or her right to remain silent, the\n       interrogation must stop immediately and the right must be scrupulously honored. This\n       does not mean an interrogation resumed at a later time is invalidated if the defendant\n       knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to be silent at this later time and the\n       defendant's right to be silent was scrupulously honored while it was invoked.\" State v.\n       Robinson, 261 Kan. 865, 887-88, 934 P.2d 38 (1997).\n\n\n       In Aguirre, the court considered \"whether the police could obtain a valid Miranda\nrights waiver at a subsequent interrogation after refusing to honor an invocation of those\nrights at the first interview.\" 301 Kan. at 961. The Aguirre majority found that the\ndefendant attempted to invoke his Miranda rights and cease questioning in an initial\ninterview, but that detectives failed to scrupulously honor that invocation. This, the\nmajority concluded, meant that Aguirre's statements in the first interview should have\nbeen suppressed. In considering Aguirre's statements at a followup interview, the\nmajority applied a two-part analysis previously set forth in State v. Matson, 260 Kan.\n366, 374, 921 P.2d 790 (1996), and State v. Mattox, 280 Kan. 473, 481, 124 P.3d 6\n(2005):\n\n\n\n\n                                                    78\n\f       \"[T]he validity of a Miranda waiver, after a suspect has previously invoked those rights,\n       depends on whether 'the accused (a) initiated further discussions with the police and (b)\n       knowingly and intelligently waived the previously asserted right.' The State failed the\n       Matson test by reinitiating the second interrogation. [Citations omitted.]\" Aguirre, 301\n       Kan. at 961.\n\n\n       Thus, the court concluded, \"Under that circumstance, the police were constrained,\nif not prohibited, from reinitiating questioning\" and \"the statements obtained in the\nsecond interview should have been suppressed, as well.\" Aguirre, 301 Kan. at 961-62.\n\n\n       Here, detectives did not stop their questioning after Flack's invocation. Instead,\nthey continued to try to convince Flack to \"help us find this baby\" by zeroing in on the\n\"Mexicans\" or \"South Side \"South Side Lobos\" he had mentioned. And while the second\ninterview began about fourteen-and-a-half hours after the first interview ended\u2014an\ninterlude in which Flack was offered three meals and \"a place to rest\"\u2014and while Flack\nwas given fresh Miranda warnings at the outset of the second interview, detectives, not\nFlack, initiated the second interview. Thus, Flack's statements in the second interview\nshould have also been suppressed.\n\n\n       Harmlessness\u2014Guilt Phase\n\n\n       I turn next to the harmlessness of the district court's error.\n\n\n               \"When a defendant's constitutional rights have been violated, the State must\n       'carry the burden of proving \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of . . .\n       did not affect the outcome of the trial in light of the entire record, i.e., proves there is no\n       reasonable possibility that the error affected the verdict.\"'\" Walker, 304 Kan. at 457.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     79\n\f       I begin with the error's effect on the guilt phase of Flack's trial, beginning with his\nconviction for the killing of White.\n\n\n       White's Killing\n\n\n       During his second interview, Flack admitted that he and Stout killed White\ntogether, each of them shooting White once with a shotgun. Flack further admitted to\ncovering White's body with a tarp and leaving it in the outbuilding for more than a week.\nAs the prosecutor emphasized during closing arguments, evidence suggested that White\ndied from two gunshot wounds, each caused by PDX Home Defender shotgun rounds. In\nhis pre-\"invocation\" statements, Flack admitted purchasing Defender rounds for his\nshotgun.\n\n\n       The shotgun that was partially recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014\nwhich contained a mixed DNA profile from at least three people, of whom Flack could\nnot be excluded as the major contributor\u2014fired at least one of the shell casings found in\nthe outbuilding where White was killed. Evidence also suggested that this same weapon\nfired the five shell casings recovered from the residence's master bedroom, where the\nbodies of Stout and K.B. were found and where (based on bloodstains) evidence\nsuggested L.B. was shot. The weapon was a 12-gauge \"pump action\" shotgun that\nrequired a discrete action to eject a spent round and chamber a new round before each\nindividual shot could be fired. Evidence suggested that Flack owned a 12-gauge pump\naction shotgun that he kept at Stout's property, of which he was \"proud.\" One witness\nnoted that Flack \"had [the shotgun] with him everywhere he went\" and that he had even\nslept next to it at times. In his pre-\"invocation\" statements, Flack admitted that he owned\na \"Remington 1300.\"\n\n\n\n                                              80\n\f       In closing arguments, the prosecutor noted the lack of forensic evidence of a\nstruggle surrounding White's death and highlighted evidence suggesting White was shot\nin the outbuilding. The prosecutor also emphasized Flack's own statement:\n\n\n               \"And consider finally the defendant's own description of that particular incident.\n       I shot him, he dies. He indicated to law enforcement, I shot him and at the time I shot\n       him, he claims Andrew Stout shot him first, but he indicates that I shot him, he was still\n       alive when I shot him and he dies. Those are the defendant's own words.\"\n\n\n       But while the evidence suggests that White was killed in the outbuilding on Stout's\nproperty, possibly with the shotgun partially recovered from the Emporia dump, major\nuncertainties exist surrounding the timing and circumstances of White's killing. White\nwas last seen alive on April 20, 2013. As Flack points out, jurors heard testimony that\nseveral individuals were at the residence around this time, including Joseph Berger,\nbrothers Andrew and Rocky Helm, Dylan Phillips, Stout, and Flack, among others. Some\nof these guests fired weapons at Stout's property\u2014a \"good shooting spot.\" Jurors also\nheard testimony that White and Stout \"butted heads often.\"\n\n\n       The State highlights evidence that Flack \"discouraged\" his friends from contacting\nthe authorities about White's disappearance. The State highlights circumstantial evidence\nsuggesting that Flack killed Stout, L.B., and K.B., which further implies that Flack also\nkilled White; as the State puts it, Flack \"was the only person of that group to walk away\nfrom the residence alive.\" But while this may be a reasonable extrapolation, it does not\nestablish no reasonable possibility that Flack's confession to killing White affected the\njury's verdict. In particular, the killing of White stands apart in both time and place from\nthe killings of Stout, K.B., and L.B., who were all killed several days after White and\ninside the residence, rather than the outbuilding. In my view, the forensic evidence\nsuggesting Flack's guilt is not overwhelming enough to overcome the prejudicial effect of\n\n                                                   81\n\fhis direct confession to White's murder. Thus, I would reverse his conviction for White's\nmurder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       Stout's Killing\n\n\n       Stout was shot four times with a shotgun, including once in the back. Shell casing\nevidence suggested that the shotgun that was partially recovered from an Emporia\nrecycling center was used in the killing of White, Stout, K.B., and L.B. While Stout was\nfound in the same bedroom as K.B.'s body (where L.B. was also likely shot), the\nevidence suggests he was killed at least a few days before them\u2014between April 28 and\n30, 2013, rather than between May 1 and May 5.\n\n\n       Surveillance camera evidence established that Flack accompanied Stout on a trip\nto Ottawa on April 28. On that trip, Stout wore the same shirt in which he ultimately died.\nCircumstantial evidence suggests that Flack further accompanied Stout to Emporia,\nalthough the surveillance camera evidence is less clear on this point. Yet this evidence\nstill does not directly place Flack at Stout's residence at the time of Stout's killing,\nalthough it may suggest that he was still with Stout at that time. Additionally, Flack's\nfingerprints were present on items in the bedroom where Stout and K.B. were found.\nEvidence also placed Flack at Stout's residence around and after the time Stout was likely\nkilled, and Flack made false statements to others concerning Stout's whereabouts after\nStout's death. For instance, when Phillips stopped by on April 29, he met only Flack, who\ntold him that Stout was running errands before work.\n\n\n       Unlike White's killing, little evidence supported the presence of other individuals\nat the residence\u2014other than Flack\u2014during the timeframe of Stout's killing. Flack's brief\nadmits that evidence existed to establish Flack's presence at the house after Stout's death,\nthat Flack made false statements about seeing Stout after he would have been dead, and\n                                           82\n\fthat Flack \"disposed of the shotgun used to shoot Mr. Stout.\" But Flack points out that\u2014\nother than his statements\u2014there is no evidence he was present at the precise time of\nStout's death, much less that he was the shooter. While that much could be inferred from\nhis later actions\u2014not the least of which was remaining at the house afterward\u2014any such\ninferences cannot overcome the prejudicial impact of the admission of his statements,\nincluding his admission that he was present at the time of Stout's death. Additionally,\nwhile circumstantial evidence could support the inference that Flack was using Stout's\nphone after his death, that inference could not then support a new inference that,\ntherefore, Flack was Stout's killer. Cf. State v. Colson, 312 Kan. 739, 750, 480 P.3d 167\n(2021) (inference stacking is prohibited). Moreover, any error resulting from the\nadmission of Flack's statements vis-\u00e0-vis the killing of White\u2014to which he admitted\u2014\nwould also infect the jury's (otherwise justifiable) inference that Flack was, in fact,\nStout's killer. That the jury ultimately convicted Flack of second-degree murder for\nStout's death further suggests some uncertainty about the circumstances of this killing,\nthough I do not propose to read the tea leaves of the jury's verdict.\n\n\n       Consequently, while the circumstantial evidence supported Flack's conviction for\nStout's murder, it is not overwhelming enough to rule out all reasonable possibility that\nthe erroneous admission of Flack's statements affected the jury's verdict. Thus, I would\nalso reverse Flack's conviction for Stout's murder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       The Killing of L.B. and K.B.\n\n\n       In closing, the prosecutor focused heavily on forensic evidence to establish that\nL.B. and K.B. were killed close in time to one another. But the prosecutor asked jurors to\n\"consider his words to law enforcement\":\n\n\n\n                                             83\n\f       \"He was correctly able to inform law enforcement what the order of death was. Steven\n       White first, Andrew Stout second, [K.B.] third, [L.B.] last. There's only one way that you\n       know that. There's only one way. You were there and you did it.\n\n\n               \"He correctly knew the location of the bodies. He knew that Steven White was in\n       the outbuilding. He knew that Andrew Stout was in the corner. He knew that [K.B.] was\n       buried near the bed. Now he claims he didn't know where [L.B.] was, but he did indicate\n       that she was in a suitcase and that she was wrapped in a blanket. He also correctly\n       described the [s]tate of [K.B.]'s body, her clothing or lack thereof.\n\n\n               \"Now in the defendant's statements to law enforcement there were at least eight\n       versions and there are significant inconsistencies between each of the versions. It's for\n       you to judge and determine and assess the credibility of all those different versions and\n       what inconsistencies there are.\n\n\n               \"But the inconsistencies all have something in common. They are designed to\n       take the focus and responsibility off of the defendant. It's always, you know, Andrew shot\n       Steven White. Oh, Omar and Chewie, they're the ones that shot Andrew Stout and [K.B.]\n       and [L.B.]. I was just there. He puts himself there during the murders but he's always got\n       a little bit less of a responsibility. Yet he has all these details and there's all this evidence\n       that all points to one person and one person alone, the defendant.\"\n\n\n       In my view, the circumstantial evidence here appears strong enough to eliminate\nany reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's insinuation that Flack had \"all these\ndetails\" affected the jury's verdict. Unlike the killing of White and Stout, the evidence\nsurrounding the deaths of L.B. and K.B. effectively rules out any lesser degrees of\nhomicide beyond premeditated first-degree murder. K.B. was gagged, naked from the\nwaist down, and had her hands bound behind her back with zip ties at the time of her\ndeath. She was shot in the back of the neck by a shotgun while prone or kneeling on the\nground. Her body was later turned face up and she was covered with a pile of clothes.\nAfter the clothes were placed atop K.B.'s body, 18-month-old L.B. was shot in the back\n                                                      84\n\fwith a shotgun while facing the direction of her mother's body. Forensic evidence about\nthe contents of K.B.'s and L.B.'s stomachs further suggests that both were killed on the\nafternoon of May 1, 2013.\n\n\n       Moreover, the circumstantial evidence supporting a finding that Flack was directly\ninvolved in the killing of L.B. and K.B. is stronger than that supporting his convictions\nfor the killing of White and Stout. For instance, cell phone data suggested that Flack was\nlikely present at the residence on May 1 and May 2, 2013. On May 3, 2013, cell phone\ndata suggested that Flack began the day at the residence, then moved within a mile-and-a-\nhalf from the place where L.B.'s body was found, and then traveled to Emporia, where his\nphone remained. Flack subsequently got a new phone.\n\n\n       A little after 5 p.m. on May 7, 2013, cameras captured images of an individual\ndriving K.B.'s car to an apartment parking lot near 12th and East streets in Emporia. The\ndriver got out and threw away a bag from the car into a nearby dumpster. The bag\ncontained items belonging to K.B. and L.B., including L.B.'s baby blanket. Douglas\npicked Flack up from the parking lot of Do-B's restaurant sometime after 5 p.m. on the\nevening of May 7, 2013; this parking lot would have been very close to the parking lot\nwhere K.B.'s car was left. Circumstantial evidence thus suggested that Flack was driving\nK.B.'s car and was attempting to dispose of her and L.B.'s property.\n\n\n       Like White and Stout, L.B. and K.B. were killed with a shotgun. Beyond the\nevidence that the shotgun recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014which was\nFlack's\u2014fired several casings recovered from the residence, one of the shot shells fired\nfrom the shotgun was found on K.B.'s leg. Finally, perhaps the strongest circumstantial\nevidence of Flack's involvement in the killings can be found from the black zip ties in\nFlack's bag, which were much like the ones used to bind K.B.\n\n\n                                            85\n\f       Admittedly, the DNA evidence collected from K.B.'s body did not strongly\nimplicate Flack. For instance, the major DNA profile taken from the knot of the bandana\nused to gag K.B. fit K.B.'s DNA, but Flack could not be excluded as the source of the\nminor profile contribution\u2014although that minor profile would be consistent with the\nDNA of one in eight individuals. This evidence further suggested that Flack had touched\nand, perhaps, even tied the bandana used to gag K.B. Further, although Flack could not\nbe excluded as a contributor to samples containing mixed DNA profiles obtained from\nK.B.'s left hand fingernail clippings, this match was also weak\u2014about a 1-in-28 chance.\nMoreover, Flack could be excluded as a contributor to DNA samples collected from\nunder K.B.'s right hand fingernail clippings. No conclusion could be reached as to\nwhether Flack contributed to male DNA recovered from K.B.'s pubic hair.\n\n\n       Despite the somewhat lukewarm DNA evidence, I believe the remaining\ncircumstantial evidence of Flack's guilt is overwhelming enough to render the erroneous\nadmission of his statements harmless as to his conviction for killing L.B. and K.B. These\nkillings occurred close together in time and space and could, realistically, only have\nresulted from intentional and premeditated conduct. Thus, I concur in the result of the\nmajority's decision to affirm Flack's capital murder conviction.\n\n\n       Harmlessness\u2014Penalty Phase\n\n\n       I turn next to the harmlessness of the error in the penalty phase of Flack's trial.\nFlack argues that his statements amplified the State's description of K.B.'s last moments,\neliminated \"residual\" doubt, and made him appear unsympathetic and remorseless before\nthe jury.\n\n\n       But even if Flack's statements did not affect the jury's finding about the existence\nof aggravating circumstances, I find it probable that they affected the jury's weighing of\n                                            86\n\faggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jury watched Flack give the detectives\nseveral versions of events, as the prosecution repeatedly highlighted. This could have led\nthe jury to conclude that Flack was a remorseless killer who deserved to die for his\ncrimes.\n\n\n       Because I find it probable that Flack's statements impacted at least some of the\nindividual jurors' assessment of the mitigating circumstances, I would vacate Flack's\nverdict of death and remand for a new sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n\n       Conclusion\n\n\n       A \"right\" to silence which cannot be exercised in practice\u2014even by actual\nsilence\u2014is no right at all. Because the majority's analysis undermines the exercise of the\nconstitutional right to silence by implicitly penalizing Flack for failing to utter the proper\nincantation\u2014despite his repeated, clear requests that the detectives take him to jail, which\nwould necessarily terminate the interview\u2014I respectfully dissent. All the same, I concur\nin affirming Flack's conviction for capital murder, as I believe the evidence of his guilt to\nbe overwhelming enough to neutralize the prejudicial effect of the erroneous admission\nof Flack's statements. Likewise, I concur with the majority's analysis about Flack's\nremaining claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                              87\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n                                       No. 115,964\n\n                                    STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                        Appellee,\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                  KYLE TREVOR FLACK,\n                                       Appellant.\n\n\n                             SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n1.\n       When the facts material to a decision on a motion to suppress evidence are not in\ndispute, the inquiry on appeal becomes a question of law.\n\n\n2.\n       Whether a defendant&#x27;s repeated statements during a custodial interview to &quot;[t]ake\nme to jail&quot; constitute an unambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent depends on\ntheir context.\n\n\n3.\n       The ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in\nDeath Penalty Cases are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim in a capital case, but they are not coextensive with constitutional\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f4.\n        Appellate courts review continuance denials for abuse of discretion.

In a separate proceeding, it\nsentenced him to death after finding two aggravating factors that were not outweighed by\nmitigating circumstances. On direct appeal, Flack raises numerous issues. We affirm his\nconvictions and the sentence.\n\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       In 2013, Andrew Stout and two friends, including Steven White, lived at Stout&#x27;s\nhouse in rural Franklin County. Flack, another friend of Stout&#x27;s, occasionally spent time\nthere. Flack brought a shotgun with him everywhere, usually keeping it in a black duffel\nbag, and even slept with it nearby. Stout was dating K.B. and intended for the friends to\nmove out by May 1, so she and her 18-month-old daughter, L.B., could move in.\n\n\n       After not hearing from Stout, on May 6, some concerned friends went to his home\nto look for him. While checking an outbuilding near the house, they discovered a body\nunder a tarp, later identified as White. They called 911. Investigators found two more\nbodies in the house, later identified as Stout and K.B. The investigators suspected Flack,\nwho they located in Emporia at a friend&#x27;s apartment. Officers arrested him shortly after\nmidnight on May 8, and read him his Miranda rights. They searched the Emporia\napartment, finding a black duffel bag. It contained a shotgun cleaning kit, a roll of duct\ntape, and zip ties.\n\n\n       Flack provided his versions of events to detectives twice after his arrest. His story\nevolved during those interviews. The first started around 3:30 a.m. on May 8 in Emporia.\nBy that time, officers had identified White&#x27;s body in the outbuilding but not the two in the\nmaster bedroom. They considered L.B., the child, to be missing.\n                                          3\n\fFirst interview\n\n       In what the State depicts as Flack&#x27;s first of eight versions of events, he claimed to\nlast see Stout, K.B., and L.B. on April 27 at Stout&#x27;s house. He said Stout and K.B.\nplanned to go bowling after Flack and Stout bought cigarettes. Flack claimed they\nseparated in Pomona, where his friend, Kenneth Douglas, picked him up and drove him\nto Emporia.\n\n\n       As details emerged, so did inconsistencies. Flack said he and Stout went to Ottawa\nbefore Pomona. Stout dropped him off at the Pomona Dollar General, and Flack then\nwent to a nearby cemetery with two women, who later took him to Ottawa. From there,\nhis stepbrother picked him up, and he slept on the stepbrother&#x27;s couch that night. He did\nnothing the next day, April 28, other than walk around Pomona.\n\n\n       Then, Flack said he went to Emporia on April 29. But before going, his stepfather\ndropped him off at Stout&#x27;s house, where he played video games for a half hour. At that\ntime, some people stopped by looking for Stout. The stepfather returned and took him to\nthe Pomona Dollar General, where Douglas picked him up to go to Emporia. Flack said\nhe stayed with Douglas while there, and he bought a new cellphone after Douglas&#x27; kids\nbroke his old one. He later changed that story, saying he broke the phone himself. He\nacknowledged speaking to Stout&#x27;s mother by both phone and text during this time.\n\n\n       Without prompting, Flack mentioned his shotgun, claiming Stout kept Flack&#x27;s\n1300 Remington in his bedroom closet. He also mentioned buying &quot;PDX Defender&quot;\nshotgun shells from Wal-Mart a few months earlier.\n\n\n       Flack also claimed Stout sold marijuana, and every resident at Stout&#x27;s house used\ndrugs. When describing White, he said White brought &quot;tweakers&quot; (methamphetamine\n\n                                              4\n\fusers) to Stout&#x27;s and that made Stout nervous. The last time Flack saw him, White &quot;was\nfuckin&#x27; out of his mind, like been up too long, like you could see his eyes all fucking\nblack and sunk in.&quot; Flack got along with White, but he would not call him his &quot;best\nfriend.&quot;\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s second version began after Detective Tammy Alexander confronted him\nwith other witness statements. She told Flack that Douglas denied his kids broke the\nphone and said he picked up Flack in Emporia, not Pomona. Alexander told Flack the\nvictims were shot with a shotgun, and that &quot;Defender&quot; shotgun shells were at the scene;\nshe noted K.B.&#x27;s car was found in Emporia, where Flack had been.\n\n\n       Flack eventually said he was in Emporia to sell drugs. He sold &quot;dope&quot;\n(methamphetamine) to a group of Mexicans known as the South Side Lobos. He also\nclaimed to work for &quot;Omar,&quot; a bald-headed Mexican with a 13 tattooed on his chest,\nwhom he had met in prison. Omar, in turn, introduced Stout to &quot;Chewie,&quot; so Chewie\ncould supply Stout with marijuana for dealing. Omar drove him to Emporia, and from\nthere Douglas picked him up. Flack appeared to be explaining why he lied about the\nplace where he met Douglas and attempting to align his story with Douglas&#x27;.\n\n\n       Flack then mentioned going to Stout&#x27;s on April 29 or 30. Finding the door locked\nand no one home, he walked to the outbuilding, where he noticed something unnatural\nbecause the dog&#x27;s bowl was outside and windows left open. In the outbuilding, he saw a\nfoot hanging out from a tarp. Not knowing what to do, he left the residence.\n\n\n       The conversation returned to Omar, Chewie, and Flack&#x27;s Emporia business. He\ndescribed delivering drugs for Omar right after being dropped off in Emporia. He said\nOmar gave him a car, telling him he could use it if needed. Seeing the car&#x27;s license plate,\nFlack told Alexander that in &quot;[t]hat moment I knew it was my ass,&quot; because he realized it\n                                            5\n\fwas K.B.&#x27;s car. Even though he did not think it could be proven and did not know why\nOmar would want to kill Stout, he said, &quot;I guess they did it, but I don&#x27;t know.&quot;\n\n\n       During questioning, Alexander showed Flack a mugshot and asked if he knew the\nperson. His answer was unclear. Alexander later testified the photo was of a long-\ndeceased person named Omar who had been arrested in Emporia but had never been in\nthe Hutchison prison while Flack was there. At the end of the Emporia interview,\nAlexander asked what happened to L.B. Flack told her &quot;they . . . took the kid,&quot; and &quot;the\ndude could be a child molester.&quot; Officers then transported Flack to Ottawa, where he\nrested and ate.\n\n\nSecond interview\n\n       The next day in Ottawa, Flack&#x27;s interview began his third version. In this iteration,\nhe claimed Omar and Chewie killed Stout and K.B. while Flack was at the house. He did\nnot see L.B. that day. The murders happened a day or two before the people stopped by\nStout&#x27;s and found Flack at the house alone.\n\n\n       On the day of the murders, Flack went to Stout&#x27;s with Omar and Chewie, who\nwent in, while he stayed outside. Upon hearing a gunshot, he became frightened and fled.\nFlack saw Omar and Chewie carry duffel bags from the house. Flack contacted his\nstepfather for transportation. Flack spent time in Ottawa and Pomona before going back\nto Stout&#x27;s, getting K.B.&#x27;s car, and driving it to Emporia.\n\n\n       Later in the interview, Flack&#x27;s fourth version emerged, placing himself inside the\nhouse during the murders. According to this account, Omar, Chewie, and Flack were at\nStout&#x27;s because Stout owed Omar money. All three went into the house, and, once inside,\nOmar and Chewie entered Stout&#x27;s bedroom with Stout and shut the door. Flack heard two\n\n                                              6\n\fgunshots and ran out. Outside, he heard additional gunfire. Seeking cover under the front\nporch, he witnessed Omar leaving with drugs and a shotgun. After Omar and Chewie left,\nFlack discovered Stout&#x27;s lifeless body in the bedroom under a pile of clothes. He then\ntook K.B.&#x27;s keys from her purse, walked to the outbuilding, and noticed another body\nunder a tarp. He took K.B.&#x27;s car to Ottawa, called Douglas to plan to visit Emporia, and\ndrove K.B.&#x27;s car to Emporia a day or two later.\n\n\n       Up to this point, Flack had not described White&#x27;s death. That changed with his\nfifth version, in which he claimed a &quot;skinny Mexican&quot; killed White. Based on this\nversion, the day White died, he met with Omar, Chewie, and the Mexican in Ottawa and\nthey all drove to Stout&#x27;s. Omar and the Mexican went inside where Stout, K.B., and\nWhite were. Flack and Chewie stayed outside. When Omar and the other man came back\noutside, everything seemed fine. Flack thought they would leave, but Omar asked about\nguns. Flack brought his shotgun outside, and the group took turns shooting it. White\ncame out and joined in.\n\n\n       After White fired the gun, he handed it to the Mexican. While the others chatted,\nWhite and the Mexican went to the outbuilding. Flack heard a gunshot. The Mexican\ncame out and went into the house with Chewie. Three more gunshots were fired. The two\nmen came back out with a duffel bag, keys, and a wallet. They then drove back to\nOttawa, leaving Flack with K.B.&#x27;s car. Omar told him to get rid of the car.\n\n\n       In his sixth version, Flack told detectives he and Stout shot White in mid-April. He\nclaimed Stout and White argued one day about White living there rent-free. Later that\nevening, Stout told Flack he did not know what to do about White. Flack told him, &quot;[J]ust\nshoot him.&quot; Stout replied, &quot;[I]f I do that[,] I&#x27;ll have to bury him.&quot; Flack told Detective\nJeremi Thompson, &quot;[T]hat&#x27;s when the joking stopped.&quot; The next day, Flack and Stout\n\n\n                                              7\n\fdiscussed the situation again. Responding to Stout&#x27;s worry, Flack told him to &quot;just do\nwhatever you need to do&quot; and that he had Stout&#x27;s &quot;back.&quot;\n\n\n       Not long after that, Stout asked White if he had gotten a job yet, which led to more\nbickering. White went outside. Stout grabbed Flack&#x27;s shotgun, and he and Flack followed\nWhite. Stout shot White, who was in front of a car in the outbuilding. Stout gave Flack\nthe shotgun. Flack shot White again, which killed him. After hiding the body under a\ntarp, the two went inside the house and pondered next steps while smoking marijuana.\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s seventh version addressed Stout&#x27;s murder. Flack said after White&#x27;s murder,\nhe got paranoid. He called Omar to see if Omar could help him leave the area. Omar\nagreed but insisted on Stout returning the fronted drugs and money first. As a result,\nOmar and Chewie came to Stout&#x27;s to settle up. Once there, Omar and Stout began\narguing. Eventually, Omar shot Stout twice in the back. Flack claimed Omar shot Stout\ntwo more times and then beat him with the shotgun. During the shooting, K.B. laid on the\nbed with her hands tied behind her back.\n\n\n       Either Omar or Chewie\u2014Flack could not remember who\u2014thought Flack looked\nstressed by what had happened, so they gave him money to buy marijuana. When he\ncame back, Flack found Stout dead under the clothing pile. He told the detectives Omar\ngave him the shotgun and said to get rid of it. He said he broke it down and threw it into a\ndumpster in Emporia.\n\n\n       In his eighth version, Flack described what happened to K.B. and L.B. When\nOmar killed Stout, K.B. tried to run out of the room. Chewie told Flack to grab her, so he\ndid. Flack found zip ties in his bag, and Chewie gave him a bandana to silence K.B.\nMeanwhile, L.B. entered the room. Chewie took K.B. to the living room, where he raped\nher.\n                                             8\n\f       Afterward, Chewie brought K.B. back to the bedroom and forced her to lie face\ndown on the floor. He shot K.B. with the shotgun. Chewie rolled her over next to Stout.\nHe and Omar started throwing clothes on the bodies. Then L.B. walked toward her\nmother. Chewie shot L.B. in the back and put her into a small suitcase he found in the\nbedroom. Omar and Chewie took the suitcase, drugs, and money to the car and left. They\ntold Flack it was &quot;his problem&quot; to get rid of K.B.&#x27;s car and the shotgun. Sitting on the\nporch, he called his brother to figure out whether to call the police or run. He drove to\nEmporia and stayed with Douglas for a few days.\n\n\n       The interview ended when Flack requested an attorney.\n\n\nPost-interview investigation\n\n       Investigators followed up on Flack&#x27;s claims he met &quot;Omar&quot; in prison. They\nreviewed lists of inmates overlapping his time in prison, producing a few leads, but none\nwere &quot;Omar.&quot; They also reviewed his phone records, identifying most calls and who was\non the other end. No calls were connected to &quot;Omar&quot; or &quot;Chewie.&quot;\n\n\n       Emporia&#x27;s city recycling center found a shotgun receiver and magazine in the trash\nand notified police. Forensic testing showed they were from the same gun that fired the\nshotgun shells discovered at Stout&#x27;s.\n\n\n       On May 11, an Osage County sheriff&#x27;s deputy found debris on a creek bank that\nled to locating L.B.&#x27;s body, which was contained in a partially submerged black suitcase.\n\n\n       Cell tower data for Flack&#x27;s phone established that from May 1 until the morning of\nMay 3, his phone did not move from the general area of Stout&#x27;s house. Around 10:40\n\n                                             9\n\fa.m., May 3, there was a single call attributed to his phone that registered on two towers,\nshowing Flack was about a mile-and-a-half from where police found L.B.&#x27;s body. Later\non May 3, the phone began using towers around Emporia. While there, Flack bought a\nnew phone, and the data showed him moving around Emporia on May 6 and May 7.\n\n\n       In mid-August, Flack&#x27;s mother met him in jail, and the visit was recorded. Flack\ntold his mother, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna end up gettin&#x27; a lotta time outta this&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not guilty of all\nof it but I&#x27;m guilty.&quot; Flack also revealed he lied to police: &quot;[D]own the line they&#x27;re gonna\nask me questions like . . . who else was involved . . . . And unfortunately . . . they didn&#x27;t\nbelieve my fuckin&#x27; story. I tried tellin&#x27; &#x27;em . . . some bullshit but they didn&#x27;t\u2014uh, they\nalready had so much evidence I guess.&quot;\n\n\nCriminal proceedings\n\n       The State charged Flack with the capital murder of K.B. and L.B. in the same\ncourse of conduct, first-degree murder of Stout, first-degree murder of White, criminal\npossession of a firearm, and misdemeanor sexual battery of K.B. At arraignment, the\nState filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty based on five aggravators: (1)\nFlack was previously convicted of attempted second-degree murder; (2) he knowingly or\npurposefully killed more than one person; (3) he committed the crime to avoid or prevent\nlawful arrest or prosecution; (4) he killed K.B. in an especially heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel manner; and (5) he killed K.B. as a potential witness against him.\n\n\n       During the trial&#x27;s guilt phase, the State&#x27;s evidence included what is outlined above.\nIts theory was that the murders occurred in large part as Flack described, but it was he,\nrather than &quot;Omar&quot; or &quot;Chewie,&quot; who performed the acts. Flack did not testify. The jury\nfound him guilty on all counts except misdemeanor sexual battery. The court accepted the\n\n\n                                              10\n\fverdicts, and the State moved for a separate sentencing proceeding for the jury to\ndetermine whether to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n       During the penalty phase, the State relied on its guilt-phase evidence, as well as\nadditional evidence. To show K.B. suffered additional mental anguish from being unable\nto see, as she was not wearing her glasses at the time of her murder, the State presented\ntestimony\u2014showing K.B. always needed glasses to see\u2014and surveillance footage of\nK.B. wearing glasses on the presumed date of her death. The State also introduced\nevidence demonstrating Flack&#x27;s previous conviction for attempted second-degree murder,\nalong with the journal entry for his previous conviction.\n\n\n       In mitigation, Flack again did not testify, instead presenting several witnesses,\nincluding an expert on how prisoners might acclimate to prison life; a prison work\nsupervisor whom Flack successfully worked with in prison; Flack&#x27;s parole officer, who\nknew of no violations he committed since being paroled; and a supervisor at Ottawa\nSanitation, who described Flack as a good employee. He also presented evidence\nshowing Flack&#x27;s horrific childhood of neglect and abuse. His friends and family testified\nhow their lives would be affected if Flack were to receive a death sentence.\n\n\n       Other witnesses\u2014many of whom were experts in mental illness and its\ntreatment\u2014testified about Flack&#x27;s mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety,\nand hallucinations. His diagnoses include major depressive disorder, schizoaffective\ndisorder, anxiety disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. His mental health struggles\nplagued him in various ways, even to the date of trial, and would likely continue, though\nless so in a structured prison environment.\n\n\n       The jury found the second and fourth aggravating factors existed: Flack\nknowingly or purposefully murdered K.B. and L.B, and he killed K.B. in an especially\n                                         11\n\fheinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. It unanimously sentenced him to death. The judge\nfound &quot;that the aggravating factors totally outweighed any mitigating factors that were\nprovided and the evidence supports the imposition of the death penalty in this particular\ncase.&quot; See K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-6617(f). The court imposed the death penalty.\n\n\n       Flack directly appeals to this court. Jurisdiction is proper. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-\n6619(a) (permitting a death sentence to automatic review by and appeal to Supreme\nCourt).\n\n\n                        SUPPRESSION OF FLACK&#x27;S POLICE INTERVIEWS\n\n       Before both the preliminary hearing and trial, the State sought to admit Flack&#x27;s\ncustodial statements to police. The defense argued against admission, claiming he\ninvoked his right to counsel. The court overruled his objections. Flack now argues he\ninvoked his right to silence through his repeated requests to be taken to jail, requiring\nsuppression of anything that followed.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n       When the State moved to admit Flack&#x27;s custodial statements for the preliminary\nhearing, it submitted testimony from the detectives who interviewed Flack. The court\nfound the statements voluntary. It also found his alleged requests for counsel were\nequivocal and did not require the detectives to end the interview. It underscored the point\nby noting Flack knew what he had to do to end the Ottawa interview by plainly stating he\nwanted to talk to his attorney. This, the court held, was a clear communication the\ndetectives &quot;honored.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       At trial, a newly assigned judge took up the renewed motion to admit the custodial\nstatements for trial purposes. The State presented its witnesses again. Detective\nAlexander testified she advised Flack of his Miranda rights at the first interview in\nEmporia and had him sign a Miranda form. The transcript reflects his agreement to speak\nto the officers:\n\n\n                 &quot;[Alexander]: . . . Before you&#x27;re asked any questions you must be advised and\n       understand your rights. Number one, you have the right to remain silent. Number two,\n       anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Number three, you have the\n       right to talk to a lawyer and have him with you while you&#x27;ve being questioned. Number\n       four, if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before\n       questioning if you wish. Number five, you can decide at any time to exercise these rights\n       and . . . not answer any questions or make any statements. . . .\n\n\n                 &quot;[Flack]: I have read or had read to me a statement of the rights listed above. I\n       understand what the rights are and I am willing to answer questions before talking to a\n       lawyer. I do not want a lawyer present during questioning. I understand and know what I\n       am doing. No promises nor threats of any kind have been made to me and no pressure or\n       coercion of any kind has been used against me and this statement has been made by me\n       voluntarily.\n\n\n                 &quot;[Alexander]: If you agree to that, I&#x27;ll have you sign it. All right, Kyle, you said\n       . . . that you were pissed off. You wanna talk to me about that?\n\n\n                 &quot;[Flack]: Yeah.\n\n\n                 &quot;[Alexander]: What are you pissed off about?\n\n\n                 &quot;[Flack]: &#x27;Cause I wanna know what happened to my friend.&#x27;&quot; (Emphases\n       added.)\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\f       Alexander testified she did not perceive any of his statements during the Emporia\ninterview as invoking his rights. She agreed that a suspect saying, &quot;[T]ake me to jail[.]\nI&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m tired of you asking the same questions,&quot; was different from asking for a\nlawyer.\n\n\n       Detective Thompson testified he did not perceive Flack&#x27;s statement\u2014&quot;&#x27;Should I\nget a lawyer honestly?&#x27;&quot;\u2014as a request for an attorney. Instead, he took it as asking\nThompson&#x27;s &quot;opinion on what he should do.&quot; Thompson told Flack he &quot;could not give\nhim legal advice.&quot; And when Flack told Thompson, &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you no more, so either do\nwhatever you do or I need an attorney or something because I can&#x27;t tell you what I don&#x27;t\nfucking know,&quot; the detective took it as an &quot;ultimatum&quot; when Flack became frustrated\nwith questioning. He testified that was a consistent pattern throughout questioning:\n&quot;[A]nytime we began asking questions in regard to [L.B.], he became upset. Visibly his\nface would turn red. He would clinch his fists, a couple times he hit the table.&quot;\n\n\n       Thompson noted the Ottawa interview ended when Flack said he could not talk to\nthe detective anymore and wanted his attorney. This remark, Thompson viewed, was\ndifferent because Flack&#x27;s earlier mentions of an attorney were followed up by him quickly\nsaying he wanted to help and wanted to talk to the detectives.\n\n\n       The court admitted the custodial statements over the defense objection, finding\nthem voluntary. It also determined Flack&#x27;s statements, &quot;&#x27;[s]hould I get a lawyer\nhonestly?&#x27;&quot; and &quot;either do whatever you do or I need an attorney . . . because I can&#x27;t tell\nyou what I don&#x27;t know,&quot; were equivocal and did not invoke the right to counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fPreservation\n\n       Flack now frames his remarks\u2014i.e., demanding to be taken to jail\u2014as an\ninvocation of his right to remain silent rather than the right to counsel. Generally, &quot;[a]\nparty may not object to the introduction of testimony on one ground at trial and assert\nanother ground on appeal.&quot; State v.

Instead, he argues various statements to take him to jail\naggregated unambiguously to invoke his right to remain silent. He says his &quot;intention to\nend the questioning was equally clear as he became progressively more insistent that the\nquestioning stop and that he be taken to jail.&quot; But &quot;it is not his intent that matters; it is\nwhether his statement would have been unambiguous to a reasonable officer.&quot; Lopez v.\nJanda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">742 Fed. Appx. 211</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished opinion). In other words,\nthe issue is whether his communication was unambiguous to a reasonable officer, not just\nhim. See Aguirre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924720\"><a href=\"/opinion/7972260/state-v-aguirre/\">301 Kan. at 957</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (a reasonable officer&#x27;s understanding matters).\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Going back to the record, Flack made his remarks over about 45 minutes, with\nmost falling during an 18-minute span, when he grew increasingly agitated as detectives\nwere hesitant to believe him and countered his story with other evidence. He grew\nparticularly angry when they pressed him about the child&#x27;s location, despite him denying\nhe knew anything. We address each comment below with its relevant context.\n\n\n       His first remark expresses his frustration at the detectives&#x27; refusal to believe him.\n\n\n                &quot;[Alexander]: . . . We have your dad who&#x27;s sayin&#x27; something totally different\n       than what you did.\n\n\n                &quot;[Flack]: . . . What did he supposedly say that&#x27;s different than me?\n\n\n                ....\n\n\n                &quot;[Alexander]: That all the times you&#x27;re sayin&#x27; you were with him is not the case.\n\n\n                &quot;[Flack]: All right, whatever, so apparently we&#x27;re at a stalemate so do I put these\n       back on and you take me somewhere or what&#x27;s the deal?&quot; (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       This plainly fails to invoke a right to remain silent. Flack merely acknowledges his\nversion differed from his father&#x27;s, and the detectives were free to not believe him. His\nsecond comment was no different.\n\n\n                &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it at all. Think I&#x27;d kill my fuckin&#x27; friends? Kidnapping some fuckin&#x27;\n       baby, take me to jail. . . . Put these motherfuckers on me, take me where you need to do\n       . . . . But I didn&#x27;t kill my fuckin&#x27; friends.

I keep fuckin&#x27; tellin&#x27; you I don&#x27;t know where the fuckin&#x27; baby\n       is.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f               ....\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: Who do we talk to?\n\n\n               ....\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: How the\u2014I do not know. . . . I only speak one fuckin&#x27; language here. I\n       don&#x27;t know where that baby is. I don&#x27;t know what happened at that fuckin&#x27; house. But\n       apparently you guys got it all sewed up. So do whatever we&#x27;re doin&#x27;. Because I can keep\n       tellin&#x27; ya the same fuckin&#x27; thing and you&#x27;re gonna keep fuckin&#x27; the same thing. . . .\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: Where was she left?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: I don&#x27;t fuckin&#x27; know. [Forth comment] Goddamn, quit\u2014\n\n\n               ....\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: . . . Who the fuck do we talk to, Kyle?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: I don&#x27;t fuckin&#x27; know. You know what? [Fifth comment] Wrap these up,\n       take me to fuckin&#x27; jail because obviously you&#x27;re just gonna keep fuckin&#x27; goin&#x27; so I can&#x27;t\n       give ya information I don&#x27;t fuckin&#x27; have so do what you do.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n\n       Flack got heated and made these comments as Alexander asked about the child&#x27;s\nwhereabouts. The third remark was a dramatic gesture, not a substantive cutting off of\nquestioning. The fourth was so brief; it was inscrutable. And the fifth appears to be\nanother &quot;take me to jail&quot; statement, &quot;because . . . I can&#x27;t give ya information I don&#x27;t\nfuckin&#x27; have so do what you do.&quot; (Emphases added.) Flack was communicating if the\nofficers keep asking questions he could not answer, they should just charge him. But,\ntaken together or separately, he does not unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent.\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f       A few minutes later, the detectives encountered strong resistance when asking\nFlack why he was in Emporia. In this context, Flack made his sixth alleged invocation:\n&quot;You wanna . . . fuckin&#x27; take me to jail, charge me, whatever, I\u2014we done sat here and\nfuckin&#x27; talked about it, okay? It&#x27;s that simple.&quot; But again, he did not clearly state to stop\nthe interview. Instead, he expressed frustration the officers were unwilling to trust him.\n\n\n       The final four remarks occurred when Alexander asked for detail about his\nEmporia business involving &quot;some Mexicans.&quot;\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: Who were you selling dope to?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: Some Mexicans.\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: What are their names?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: I don&#x27;t know their fuckin&#x27; names.\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: Where do they live?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: I don&#x27;t know where they live. I meet &#x27;em on the fuckin&#x27; south side, at\n       fuckin&#x27; at Saint Pablo Park.\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: Okay what do they drive?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: [Seventh comment] Take me to jail.\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: What do they drive?\n\n\n               &quot;[Flack]: Drive\u2014[Eighth comment] take me to jail man. . . .\n\n\n               &quot;[Alexander]: What are their phone numbers?\n\n                                                   20\n\f        &quot;[Flack]: [Ninth comment] Take me to jail.\n\n\n        &quot;[Alexander]: Kyle, this is your opportunity to help yourself.\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: How am I helpin&#x27; myself? You made your mind up.\n\n\n        &quot;[Detective Bob Moews]: No we haven&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re tryin&#x27; to ask you\nabout these people.\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: What do you want me to tell you? A bunch of fuckin&#x27; Mexicans.\nThey&#x27;re called SSLs, South Side Lobos. . . .\n\n\n        &quot;[Alexander]: What do you sell them?\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: Meth. . . .\n\n\n        &quot;[Alexander]: How much was this time?\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: Two pounds.\n\n\n        ....\n\n\n        &quot;[Alexander]: Who do you deliver for?\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: [Tenth comment] Take me to jail. . . .\n\n\n        &quot;[Alexander]: Okay, Kyle let&#x27;s help yourself, okay?\n\n\n        &quot;[Flack]: There is no help myself. . . .\n\n\n        ....\n\n\n                                               21\n\f              &quot;[Alexander]: All right, then let&#x27;s\u2014help out, okay?\n\n\n              &quot;[Flack]: I don&#x27;t know the fuckin&#x27; people. . . . [T]hey just contact me, tell me to\n       pick it up.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s comments here\u2014&quot;What do you want me to tell you?&quot;\u2014and his\nstatement\u2014&quot;I don&#x27;t know the fuckin&#x27; people&quot;\u2014lead to a reasonable inference Flack\nmeant &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; rather than invoking his right to remain silent. As the State\ncorrectly argues, his claimed invocations were &quot;amenable to a variety of interpretations&quot;\nor &quot;an expression of frustration and anger,&quot; &quot;a recognition of his difficult predicament,&quot;\n&quot;a hyperbolic effort to bolster his own credibility and convince the detectives that he was\ntelling the truth,&quot; and &quot;a negotiating tactic . . . intended to shape the investigator&#x27;s\ninterrogation more favorably to him.&quot; In context, these comments show Flack believed\nthe questioning about what happened at Stout&#x27;s house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right. He simply claimed the detectives had already made up\ntheir minds about his involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help\nthem find the child.\n\n\n       Under the circumstances, Flack&#x27;s &quot;take me to jail&quot; comments lead to multiple\ninterpretations\u2014rendering his communication unclear. Flack had experience with police\ninterviews; read the Miranda form, which stated with particularity &quot;you have the right to\nremain silent,&quot; and &quot;you can decide at any time to exercise these rights and . . . not\nanswer any questions or make any statements&quot;; affirmatively stated he understood his\nrights; and told the detectives he would answer their questions.\n\n\n       We hold Flack did not invoke his right to remain silent by repeatedly suggesting\nhe be taken to jail. Isolated or combined, his statements did not unambiguously and\nunequivocally assert his right to silence. See People v.

I&#x27;m done talking about it&#x27;&quot;; holding\nneither were unequivocal invocations of right to remain silent when viewed in context).\n\n\n       The district court properly admitted his custodial statements.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f                          FLACK&#x27;S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE\n\n\n        Throughout Flack&#x27;s case, defense counsel expressed concern they would not be\nprepared for trial. That concern became especially acute after his original counsel\nwithdrew in 2015. In response, the court continued the proceedings until the following\nspring. Despite that, the defense requested another continuance and repeated such\nrequests through the pretrial proceedings.\n\n\n        Now, on appeal, Flack asserts the district court&#x27;s scheduling orders violated his\nSixth Amendment due process right to present a defense, his corresponding rights under\nsections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights, and finally his statutory rights\nunder K.S.A. 22-3406 (reasonable time to prepare for trial) and K.S.A. 22-3401\n(continuances for good cause). From this, we discern two lines for analysis. First, he\nstatutorily argues the district court abused its discretion by denying persistent\ncontinuance requests. Second, he constitutionally asserts a due process denial under the\nfederal and state Constitutions. We reject these claims.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n        Flack&#x27;s court-appointed defense team changed during pretrial when his initial lead\nattorney withdrew in July 2015 and had to be replaced. Flack moved to continue the trial,\nclaiming the defense will not be prepared for a September trial and asked to postpone\nuntil next year. The court granted the motion and continued the trial to February 22,\n2016.\n\n\n        In November 2015, defense counsel filed a second motion to continue trial.\nCounsel argued the team&#x27;s difficulty replacing the original attorney created a deficiency\nthat could compromise Flack&#x27;s right to counsel. The team further noted it lacked\n                                           24\n\fsufficient time to review discovery and the complete investigation based on ABA\nGuidelines. See American Bar Association, American Bar Association Guidelines for the\nAppointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">31 Hofstra L.\nRev. 913</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 920 (2003). The team indicated it was still developing its mitigation case. It\nhad identified family members central to Flack&#x27;s &quot;social history&quot; but had not yet\ninterviewed them; some were out of state, while others were unwilling to meet with\ndefense counsel. It had hired experts in childhood development, forensic psychiatry, and\nprison adjustment, but the interviews were pending. And it was still collecting school,\nmedical, and psychiatric records. Finally, the team said its heavy caseloads were already\nhard to manage and would be compounded by the holidays.\n\n\n       The court heard the motion in late November ex parte and in camera. It\nacknowledged the team&#x27;s difficulties but pointed out the case had been pending for about\ntwo years. Expressing frustration with the apparent lack of progress, it denied the request\nwithout the State&#x27;s input as it was skeptical more time would materially aid the defense.\n\n\n       In January 2016, the defense renewed its motion, which was again heard by the\ncourt ex parte, in camera. Defense counsel reiterated the same concerns but highlighted\nthe need for a neuropsychologist to examine Flack and testify during the penalty phase.\nThe court denied the motion and pushed the defense to retain an expert. It asked the\ndefense to file a new continuance motion &quot;to clarify a little more succinctly the particular\nissues that prohibit you in proceeding.&quot; It said it would revisit the issue the next week.\n\n\n       When voir dire began the following week, the defense filed its third continuance\nmotion. The court heard the motion in camera after that day&#x27;s questioning. Defense\ncounsel reiterated their concerns and noted the defense team had lost its administrative\nsupport. The court systematically worked through the concerns, focusing especially on\nthe efforts to retain experts. It said, &quot;[C]ertain issues . . . should have been taken care of\n                                                25\n\fquite [some time] ago.&quot; It perceived the defense&#x27;s concerns as mainly being mitigation\npreparation and asked the defense to push forward over the two weeks remaining before\nthe scheduled opening statements. It also advised the defense to continue preparing its\nmitigation case during the guilt phase.\n\n\n       Toward the end of the week, the court returned to the continuance motion. By that\ntime, the defense had retained a neuropsychologist to begin work within a few weeks and\nwould take about a week to finish. The parties discussed a plan to push back the guilt\nphase to accommodate the expert and proposed the court complete voir dire and conduct\njury selection by February 17. The guilt phase would be pushed back to March 7, and the\npenalty phase to March 28. The court agreed, and the trial proceeded on that schedule.\nBut when the trial began, defense counsel asked for further postponement, saying only\n&quot;[w]e believe we&#x27;ve litigated this issue thoroughly.&quot; The court denied the request.\n\n\nStatutory challenge\u2014a reasonable time to prepare for trial\n\n\n       We review continuance denials for abuse of discretion. A court abuses its\ndiscretion when its action is unreasonable or based on an error of law or fact. The party\nasserting an abuse of discretion must demonstrate it. State v. Hillard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">315 Kan. 732</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">511 P.3d 883</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022). Here, Flack does not claim the district court erred based on an error\nof law or fact; our focus is whether the district court erred by acting unreasonably.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3401 requires all persons charged with a crime to be tried without\nunnecessary delay and, at the same time, allows a district court to continue proceedings\nwhen good cause is shown. In addition, K.S.A. 22-3406 entitles a defendant to &quot;a\nreasonable time to prepare for trial.&quot; Flack alleges he was denied a reasonable time to\nprepare his case.\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       The ABA Guidelines thoroughly outline recommendations for defense counsel&#x27;s\nduties in all aspects of death penalty cases. Flack relies almost exclusively on the\nguidelines and argues those obligations made his case especially time consuming,\njustifying his requested continuances. Generally, capital cases have &quot;extraordinary\ncomplexity and demands&quot; compared to noncapital cases. ABA Guidelines, 31 Hofstra L.\nRev. at 921. For example, capital cases increase defense counsel&#x27;s obligations to\ninvestigate mitigators. See generally 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 924-28. In addition, counsel\nshould &quot;at all stages of the case . . . make every appropriate effort to establish a\nrelationship of trust with the client, and should maintain close contact with the client.&quot;\nABA Guideline 10.5. Counsel also must &quot;conduct thorough and independent\ninvestigations relating to the issues of both guilt and penalty.&quot; ABA Guideline 10.7(A).\nAnd counsel must consider and assert all potential legal claims at both the guilt and\npenalty phases and each claim&#x27;s costs and benefits. ABA Guideline 10.8.\n\n\n       The ABA Guidelines are a relevant guidepost for evaluating an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim in a capital case, but they are not &quot;coextensive with\nconstitutional requirements.&quot; State v. Cheatham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923412\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971006/state-v-cheatham/\">296 Kan. 417</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923412\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971006/state-v-cheatham/\">292 P.3d 318</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2013). The guidelines and their comments are useful to gauge what is &quot;a reasonable time\nto prepare for trial&quot; under K.S.A. 22-3406, and how a district court should exercise\ndiscretion when deciding whether to grant a continuance. The concern is not whether\ncounsel satisfied the guidelines, but rather whether, in considering various circumstances\npresented in a particular case, including the guidelines, the district court gave the defense\nreasonable time to prepare for trial. Granted, the guidelines can contextualize the\nproblems facing capital defense counsel, but caselaw ultimately governs whether a\ncontinuance denial rises to an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n       In State v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3152697\"><a href=\"/opinion/3152697/state-v-robinson/\">303 Kan. 11</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3152697\"><a href=\"/opinion/3152697/state-v-robinson/\">363 P.3d 875</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015), disapproved of on other\ngrounds by State v.

At the time of the withdrawal, counsel had been working for seven months.

Nearly two years passed between his second\ncounsel entering an appearance and trial, and almost a full year passed between his third\ncounsel entering her appearance and trial. Initial and second counsel worked together for\nabout one year and three months, and the remaining counsel worked together for about\n250 days before trial after initial counsel retired in July 2015.\n\n\n        The first continuance request relied on the ABA Guidelines and focused on initial\ncounsel&#x27;s withdrawal, remaining counsel&#x27;s other caseload and inexperience in capital\ncases, the volume of discovery to review, and the need to retain expert witnesses. The\ncourt granted the continuance, mostly based on the original counsel&#x27;s withdrawal.\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\f       Flack requested a second continuance so counsel could provide Flack &quot;with the\nhigh-quality legal representation contemplated under prevailing Constitutional and\nprofessional standards.&quot; The motion again cited the ABA Guidelines and highlighted\ndefense counsel&#x27;s independent duty to investigate. The defense noted it had recently\nreceived &quot;20,000 pages and 500 discs&quot; of discovery and &quot;more than 100 scientific\nreports&quot; from the State. They were also waiting on their own experts&#x27; reports. The court\ndeferred ruling and asked the defense to push forward and keep it apprised of problems as\nthey arose.\n\n\n       The third continuance remained much the same as the second. The defense filed it\nat the court&#x27;s request during voir dire to reflect the previously raised issues&#x27; status. The\ndefense was still reviewing and synthesizing discovery and conducting its investigation.\nBut the most pressing issue was securing a neuropsychologist, which the defense did on\nFebruary 4. The court, with the State&#x27;s agreement, pushed the trial&#x27;s start date from\nFebruary 22 to March 7 to allow the expert to evaluate Flack.\n\n\n       We discern no abuse of discretion in denying the second and third continuance\nrequests. As in Robinson, Flack&#x27;s initial counsel was a single member of a three-counsel\nteam. He left second counsel with over a year on the case and a third counsel who joined\nthe team a few months earlier. Similarly, original counsel&#x27;s withdrawal did not require the\nteam to start from scratch. Recognizing second counsel could not just pick up where\noriginal counsel left off, the court granted a continuance of several months. As to the\nsecond request, the court pushed the defense to make progress and pointedly questioned\nwhat aspects were challenging. Over the next months, the outstanding tasks narrowed,\neven as the defense continued to press for postponement. The largest obstacle, needing a\nneuropsychologist, became clear as trial approached, and the court granted a short\ncontinuance.\n\n\n                                              29\n\f       Throughout this process, the record reflects the court seriously considered the\ndefense&#x27;s concerns and worked to address them as they arose. It reasonably handled the\ncase and did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\nConstitutional challenge\u2014right to present a defense\n\n\n       Flack argues the denial of his second and third continuance requests violated his\nright to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nand under sections 5 and 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. We reject these\narguments.\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment states: &quot;[T]he accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and\npublic trial, by an impartial jury . . . ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to\nhave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance\nof Counsel for his defence.&quot; Section 5 declares: &quot;The right of trial by jury shall be\ninviolate.&quot; And section 10 &quot;allow[s]&quot; the accused to\n\n\n       &quot;appear and defend in person, or by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the\n       accusation against him; to meet the witness face to face, and to have compulsory process\n       to compel the attendance of the witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an\n       impartial jury . . . . No person shall be a witness against himself, or be twice put in\n       jeopardy for the same offense.&quot;\n\n\n       The phrase &quot;right to present a defense&quot; is a blanket term for a collection of a\ndefendant&#x27;s rights, including a right to present evidence on his or her own behalf.

When rejecting his constitutional claim, the\nAnthony court considered several factors, including whether other continuances have\nbeen granted; whether legitimate reasons were shown to postpone trial; and whether\ndenial of the continuance would prejudice the defendant. The Anthony court held the trial\n                                           31\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance in which the sole reason for\nthe continuance was to permit new counsel to enter his appearance. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1208231\"><a href=\"/opinion/1208231/state-v-anthony/\">257 Kan. at 1019</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nHere, the trial began some eight months after his original counsel withdrew, and Flack\nproceeded with the same appointed counsel team he had all along. Moreover, the district\ncourt gave counsel reasonable time to prepare a capital case given the defense team&#x27;s\nrelative continuity and the total time available.\n\n\n       We hold the district court&#x27;s handling of continuance requests did not violate\nFlack&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense or his rights under sections 5 and 10\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.\n\n\n                   DENIAL OF FOR-CAUSE CHALLENGES TO SITTING JURORS\n\n\n       Throughout voir dire, the district court denied several defense for-cause challenges\nto selected jury members. These challenges questioned prospective jurors&#x27; predisposition\nto the death penalty. Some challenged members joined the 20 jurors and alternates who\nheard the case, and some of those joined the 12 who convicted Flack and sentenced him\nto death. On appeal, Flack argues the district court committed reversible error by denying\nhis challenges. Again, we disagree.\n\n\nAdditional facts\n\n\n       When voir dire began, the court separated prospective jurors into six panels. It\nquestioned two panels per day over nine days to reduce the initial group from which the\nparties could exercise peremptory challenges. Each party received 20 peremptory\nchallenges to produce a final jury of 20, including eight alternates.\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\f       During peremptory challenges, defense counsel asked for &quot;extra strikes&quot; because\nthe court denied so many of the defense&#x27;s for-cause challenges. The court ruled this was\npremature since the defense had not yet exhausted all of its peremptory strikes. After\nexercising its seventeenth peremptory challenge, the defense renewed its request for more\nstrikes. The State opposed this for two reasons. First, the defense still had some\nperemptory strikes. Second, procedurally it was unclear where the new strikes would\ncome from because alternate jurors were necessary. The court denied the request,\nreasoning the defense had already struck the only juror who was arguably &quot;automatic\ndeath.&quot; The defense then formally objected to the 20 selected jurors&#x27; composition. The\ncourt randomly selected alternate jurors but did not disclose to the jury who it selected\nuntil deliberations.\n\n\n       When trial began, the court released three jurors after each raised an issue,\nbringing the jury down to 17. Before deliberations, the court named the alternates, and\nthe 12 primary jurors deliberated and ultimately entered guilty verdicts.\n\n\n       Prior to the penalty phase, the court conducted a second voir dire at the defense&#x27;s\npretrial request to determine whether any jurors, including the alternates, had reached an\nopinion on a death sentence. The jurors were questioned individually, outside the\npresence of the others. The court asked five questions and then allowed follow-up\nquestions by the State and defense.\n\n\n       Juror J.B.&#x27;s responses during questioning raised concerns when he expressed\nreluctance to change his mind about imposing the death penalty. While claiming he\nwould follow the law and consider all mitigating circumstances, his skepticism persisted.\nAfter questioning the other jurors, the defense asked to remove two potential jurors,\nincluding J.B. Given J.B.&#x27;s role as part of the 12-member jury that convicted Flack, the\ncourt removed J.B. But it retained the other juror as being an alternate.\n                                             33\n\f       On appeal, Flack lists 18 potential jurors denied a for-cause challenge. But Flack\nused peremptory challenges to remove 16 of those 18.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review for-cause juror challenges for an abuse of discretion because the trial\njudge is better positioned to make the ruling.

The pertinent question for our appellate review is not whether we\nagree with the district judge&#x27;s ruling but, instead, whether the record fairly supports its\nruling. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3152697\"><a href=\"/opinion/3152697/state-v-robinson/\">303 Kan. at 155</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n       Of the 18 jurors Flack discusses, only M.F. and J.H. ended up as jurors. And as the\nState correctly notes, the relevant question is whether the seated jurors prejudiced Flack.\nSee Miller, 308 Kan. at 1138 (failing to excuse a juror for cause requires conviction\n                                            34\n\freversal only when the defendant demonstrates he or she was prejudiced as a result).\nEven if a defendant was compelled to use peremptory challenges &quot;to correct erroneous\nfor-cause rulings,&quot; it is a nonissue absent the defendant showing the sitting jury was\nprejudiced. 308 Kan. at 1139. Flack, as the party asserting the error, bears the burden of\nestablishing the denial of a for-cause challenge constituted an abuse of discretion and\nresulted in prejudice. 308 Kan. at 1138.\n\n\nJuror M.F.\n\n\n       During the State&#x27;s initial voir dire, the prosecutor asked M.F. about her general\nviews on the death penalty. In the past, M.F. strongly supported the death penalty without\nmuch knowledge. But after working for a judge who opposed it, she reevaluated her\nstance. She said the judge told her that &quot;many people are in prison that later they&#x27;re found\nnot guilty.&quot; She then noted, &quot;I need to be open to hearing all of the information and\nunderstanding the whole story before I can say strongly one way or the other.&quot;\n\n\n       During defense questioning, M.F. said she would consider factors such as the\ndegree of the childhood abuse or the mental illness, as well as a person&#x27;s adaptability to\nprison, as potential mitigating circumstances. But she &quot;need[ed] more information to\nmake a decision.&quot; Counsel further asked about her shifting death penalty views. She\nreiterated, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel strongly one way or the other about the death penalty. But it\ndefinitely is going to have to be very clear [that the defendant is guilty.]&quot;\n\n\n       In her questionnaire, M.F. suggested childhood experience &quot;plays a huge role&quot; but\nshould not affect capital sentencing. She believed individuals must take responsibility for\ntheir choices and must not blame others. M.F. noted she would consider factors &quot;more\nserious than [abuse or unloved]&quot; necessary to warrant capital punishment.\n\n\n                                              35\n\f       The defense challenged M.F. for cause, focusing on her questionnaire response\nsuggesting the death penalty was appropriate in a multiple victim case &quot;if there&#x27;s\nabsolutely no question about [the] person&#x27;s guilt.&quot; She &quot;equivocate[d]&quot; in her written\nresponses about her beliefs and opinions on the death penalty, which defense counsel\nclaimed made it &quot;hard to draw out any information what her thoughts are.&quot; The defense\ncharacterized her responses as &quot;it depends.&quot; Counsel argued M.F. conveyed believing\npeople must take personal responsibility for their actions created a &quot;mitigation\nimpairment with her.&quot; Ultimately, &quot;there&#x27;s a doubt that she could be impartial.&quot;\n\n\n       The court rejected this, reasoning M.F. appeared to be more favorable to the\ndefense than some jurors the defense previously challenged. M.F. affirmed she had not\nformed an opinion on Flack&#x27;s guilt from media or pretrial sources. The court emphasized\nher evolving beliefs about the death penalty and her &quot;conscientious&quot; approach, expressing\nfaith in her ability to be fair, impartial, and law-abiding at sentencing.\n\n\n       In his brief, Flack argues M.F. dismissed the importance of extreme childhood\nexperiences and said mercy would play no role in her penalty decision. He contends her\nstance, even after agreeing to follow the law, is &quot;devastating&quot; to a fair penalty trial, as her\n&quot;willingness to follow the law does not prevent long held biases from affecting a\nverdict.&quot;\n\n\n       But contrary to Flack&#x27;s contention, during voir dire, M.F. consistently expressed\nshe could not definitively answer how various factors would weigh in her decision-\nmaking process without knowing more. She clarified her questionnaire response,\nexplaining that while she would not be swayed by typical childhood traumas, she would\nconsider more serious circumstances. The record shows M.F. was open to mitigation\nevidence, and her reservation about childhood experiences pertains more to their abstract\npersuasiveness rather than a complete rejection.\n                                            36\n\f       Finally, Flack seemingly argues a juror is biased if he or she is unwilling to rely on\nthe nebulous concept of mercy alone for mitigation. But he cites no support for this. As\nJustice Scalia once noted, &quot;what one juror might consider mitigating another might not.\nAnd of course the ultimate question whether mitigating circumstances outweigh\naggravating circumstances is mostly a question of mercy\u2014the quality of which, as we\nknow, is not strained.&quot; Kansas v. Carr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">577 U.S. 108</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">136 S. Ct. 633</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">193 L. Ed. 2d\n535</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016). So even if M.F. said &quot;mercy&quot;\u2014a concept she equated with &quot;pity&quot; during voir\ndire\u2014should not be considered on her questionnaire, she remained willing to consider the\nvarious circumstances in Flack&#x27;s case before reaching a decision.\n\n\n       Rather than showing a preformed bias favoring the death penalty, M.F.&#x27;s voir dire\nresponses consistently reflected a willingness to wait and see the evidence before\ndeciding, which is exactly what a juror should do. The court scrutinized her qualifications\nand outlined its reasons why she was a qualified juror. As it pointed out, given her\nhesitation about the death penalty, if anything, M.F. was a favorable defense juror. It was\nneither error nor an abuse of discretion for the court to deny this challenge.\n\n\nJuror J.H.\n\n\n       During voir dire, J.H. reiterated a neutral view on the death penalty, expressing a\ncommitment to base his decision on the case&#x27;s facts and the court&#x27;s instructions. He\nacknowledged &quot;there&#x27;s no rehabilitation&quot; for some people but noted sometimes &quot;people\nget into situations&quot; and there are &quot;so many hypothetical situations out there.&quot; J.H.\nrecognized the weighty responsibility of imposing the death penalty, underscoring the\nneed for certainty in such decisions.\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f         On his questionnaire, J.H. indicated a belief that mercy should not play a role in\nsentencing. And when asked whether he believed in an &quot;eye for an eye,&quot; his answer was,\n&quot;Let the punishment fit the crime.&quot; During voir dire, when questioned about his &quot;eye for\nan eye&quot; response, he explained he could envision &quot;a hypothetical situation&quot; in which a\ncrime is &quot;so horrific&quot; that he could support the death penalty. But he acknowledged the\ndeath penalty is not suitable for every murder case, although it is &quot;there for a reason&quot; and\nthere are situations in which it can be used. J.H. admitted that until he learned the juror&#x27;s\nrole during this process, he had not deeply considered his stance on the death penalty.\n\n\n         Following the conclusion of J.H.&#x27;s panel, defense counsel challenged him for cause\nbased on his questionnaire responses. Counsel interpreted J.H.&#x27;s &quot;eye for an eye&quot; response\nas potentially shifting the burden to the defense to &quot;prove . . . that life without the\npossibility of parole was deserved.&quot; The court rejected this challenge, finding J.H.&#x27;s\nresponses indicated he has not yet made up his mind one way or the other and\ncharacterizing him as &quot;middle of the road&quot; on the death penalty. The court found no\nreason to doubt his fairness and impartiality during the guilt phase, and that he conveyed\na willingness to consider the mitigating circumstances if the case reached the penalty\nphase.\n\n\n         On appeal, Flack claims the district court abused its discretion by denying his for-\ncause challenge to J.H., because of his questionnaire responses: &quot;Let the punishment fit\nthe crime,&quot; and mercy should not be a factor in his decision-making. Flack continues that\nJ.H. &quot;harbor[ed] an unacceptable bias on a matter crucial for a fair proceeding,&quot; even if\nhe agreed to follow the law.\n\n\n         Nevertheless, like M.F., the record establishes J.H. would listen to the evidence\nand decide the case on the facts and law. And we hold the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying these challenges.\n                                              38\n\fJurors not challenged for cause\n\n\n       Besides M.F. and J.H., Flack argues three other seated jurors were similarly\nbiased: J.S., C.C., and G.B. He asserts both J.S. and C.C. expressed their belief that\nchildhood experiences and mercy were irrelevant considerations for determining\npunishment, citing only their questionnaire responses. For J.S. and C.C., Flack adds that\nalthough each agreed to consider childhood experiences during voir dire, the prosecution\nled them to agree only to &quot;consider&quot; mitigators, without committing to &quot;meaningful\nconsideration,&quot; potentially prejudicing the defense.\n\n\n       As for J.S., the defense questioning was cursory. When asked about his thoughts\non the death penalty, he replied he could impose it in some cases depending on the\nevidence. Similarly, when asked about his starting position for or against the death\npenalty, he stated he did not have an opinion until he considered the evidence. Defense\ncounsel asked each juror if they could &quot;consider mercy for that guilty murder&quot;; J.S.\nsimply replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Counsel did not follow up. In fact, his response to most questions\nwas a simple yes or no. And he said he would follow and apply the law. When asked\nabout mitigating factors, he answered he would consider the evidence whether &quot;the\nperson really . . . [was] aware of what he was doing.&quot;\n\n\n       The State asked C.C. to elaborate on her questionnaire responses about the effect\nof childhood experiences. She elucidated upbringing may not always determine the\noutcome, but &quot;a loving, caring home&quot; increases the likelihood of the individuals &quot;turning\nout to be better people.&quot; Despite this, she acknowledged she had written that &quot;people are\nresponsible for their actions.&quot; The State followed by asking whether she could consider\nchildhood experiences as mitigating factors, C.C. replied people &quot;have to be accountable\n\n\n                                            39\n\ffor [their actions]&quot; but she &quot;would consider aggravating and mitigating&quot; factors and\n&quot;weigh them up&quot; in her decision-making process.\n\n\n       When questioned by defense counsel, C.C. acknowledged she placed greater\nimportance on the circumstances of killing in the context of aggravating and mitigating\nconsiderations. She confirmed &quot;the background of a person&quot; would not matter to her. But\nshe clarified a commitment to fairness and honesty in weighing these factors. After\nfurther questioning, C.C. agreed she would give the defense&#x27;s mitigators weight, consider\nthem, and &quot;truly give [them] meaningful consideration.&quot;\n\n\n       As for G.B., Flack contends he &quot;expressed strong biases in favor of the death\npenalty, writing that he definitely favored the death penalty, if the murder of a mother\nand child were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; G.B. did not think childhood\nexperiences were relevant to capital punishment, as there was &quot;&#x27;no excuse for capital\nmurder.&#x27;&quot; Flack claims the &quot;upshot&quot; of G.B.&#x27;s agreement to &quot;consider&quot; childhood\nexperiences after saying they were not &quot;relevant&quot; on his questionnaire was &quot;that he would\nconsider them but not give them relevance.&quot;\n\n\n       On his questionnaire, G.B. acknowledged the role of upbringing in adult behavior\nbut maintained it did not excuse capital murder. The State asked whether his position\nchanged after he understood the process for imposing the death penalty; G.B. said he\nwould consider any mitigating circumstances he was instructed to consider. Defense\ncounsel gave G.B. a hypothetical of a conviction with various aggravators. Counsel asked\nhow jurors should view the death penalty before factoring in any mitigators. G.B.\nanswered, &quot;You have to look at the mitigators to get it on the scale and the aggravators\nwould have to outweigh the mitigators.&quot; Counsel characterized his questionnaire response\nabout the likelihood of imposing the death penalty for the premeditated capital murder of\na woman and child as &quot;almost automatic.&quot; But G.B. clarified that was not what he had\n                                          40\n\fmeant, &quot;[i]t depends on all the evidence presented.&quot; G.B. also noted that after he learned\n&quot;how the system works,&quot; he could consider childhood experiences as a mitigating\ncircumstance.\n\n\n       The State, of course, did not have a chance to rehabilitate the jurors because Flack\ndid not challenge them during the trial. Likewise, the court could not make a record for\nappellate review on each juror&#x27;s ability to be fair and impartial. Thus, Flack&#x27;s failure\nburdens our analysis.\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s cursory argument about these jurors&#x27; prejudices focuses on their limited\nresponses and matter-of-course agreement to apply the law as instructed. But the record\nestablishes trial counsel never probed deeper into the concerns appellate counsel now\nraises. Nothing shows these jurors were improperly prejudiced or biased against Flack.\nThe district court conducted voir dire carefully and cautiously, addressing the defense&#x27;s\nconcerns seriously. The follow-up voir dire questioning either clarified or rehabilitated\neach juror&#x27;s positions, so the court could reasonably conclude these jurors would be fair\nand impartial. We find no error.\n\n\n                           GUILT PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack asserts three instances of guilt-phase prosecutorial error that, individually\nand collectively, warrant conviction reversal. First, he claims the State&#x27;s repeated use of\nthe expression &quot;level[ing] the scales&quot; during voir dire to describe the jury&#x27;s role at\nsentencing negated the presumption of life in Kansas. Second, he argues the State&#x27;s\nmention of Mother&#x27;s Day during opening statements to describe the discovery of L.B.&#x27;s\nbody was inflammatory and meant to provoke juror sympathy. Third, he claims a\nbaseball analogy during the State&#x27;s closing rebuttal argument gave an incorrect reasonable\ndoubt definition. We disagree.\n                                              41\n\fStandard of review\n\n\n       We review prosecutorial error claims in two steps: error and prejudice. First, we\ndetermine whether the alleged acts &quot;&#x27;fall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to\nconduct the State&#x27;s case.&#x27;&quot; State v.

In other words, the question is whether there is no reasonable possibility that the\nerror contributed to the verdict. Blansett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4375337\"><a href=\"/opinion/4598084/state-v-blansett/\">309 Kan. at 412</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\nLeveling the scales\n\n\n       Before each voir dire panel, the State consistently described the transition from the\nguilt phase to the penalty phase by using the colloquialism &quot;level[ing] the scales.&quot; In one\npanel, for example, the prosecutor told jurors they would once again hear the evidence\nand follow the judge&#x27;s instructions. And based on the evidence and the law, the jury\nwould determine whether the sentence should be life without the possibility of parole or\nthe death penalty. The prosecutor illustrated the &quot;concept of the process&quot; as: &quot;You have a\nscale, you level the scale. . . . Then you consider the circumstances.&quot;\n\n\n       These included the statutory aggravating circumstances the State had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt on one side and the mitigating circumstances, which need not\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the other. The prosecutor told the panel, &quot;The\nweighing of circumstance is an individual determination&quot; &quot;based upon your own life\n                                           42\n\fexperiences, and your values.&quot; The prosecutor concluded if &quot;[t]he aggravators outweigh\nthe mitigators, imposition of the death penalty. If the mitigators outweigh the\naggravators, life without the possibility of parole. If they&#x27;re equal, imposition of the death\npenalty.&quot; The prosecutor used a similar description with each panel.\n\n\n       In Kansas, our statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty requires a\nsentencing jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutory aggravating\ncircumstance and, &quot;further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not\noutweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist.&quot; K.S.A. 2022\nSupp. 21-6617(e). Under this scheme, if the aggravating circumstances and mitigating\ncircumstances are in &quot;equipoise,&quot; as we have termed it, the sentence is death. Kansas v.\nMarsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145632\"><a href=\"/opinion/145632/kansas-v-marsh/\">548 U.S. 163</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145632\"><a href=\"/opinion/145632/kansas-v-marsh/\">126 S.

Ed. 2d 429</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006).\n\n\n       In Marsh, the defendant argued the equipoise provision &quot;establishes an\nunconstitutional presumption in favor of death.&quot; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145632\"><a href=\"/opinion/145632/kansas-v-marsh/\">548 U.S. at 166-67</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But the Court\nrejected that argument and held it was constitutionally permissible for an equipoise\nweighing to result in a death sentence. In reaching that conclusion, the Court stated our\n&quot;sentencing system is dominated by the presumption that life imprisonment is the\nappropriate sentence for a capital conviction&quot; because it requires a life sentence if the\nState fails to meet its burden to prove an aggravating circumstance. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145632\"><a href=\"/opinion/145632/kansas-v-marsh/\">548 U.S. at 178</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nFlack argues the presumption of life the Court found &quot;dominated&quot; our system means the\n&quot;jury does not start with level scales.&quot; He asserts that because &quot;&#x27;level scales&#x27; is a more\ncolloquial term for equipoise,&quot; the prosecutor&#x27;s language &quot;with every jury panel, and thus\nwith every seated juror,&quot; &quot;primed the jury to start from equipoise rather than the proper\npresumption of life.&quot;\n\n\n       We agree with Flack&#x27;s premise that our capital sentencing scheme includes a\npresumption of life. But we do not agree with his conclusion that the prosecutor&#x27;s\n                                           43\n\f&quot;level[ing] the scales&quot; phrasing contradicted that presumption or misstated the law. The\n&quot;default&quot; sentence after a capital conviction is a life sentence without the possibility of\nparole. And that default continues until the State proves, and the jury finds, an\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. It is only at that point the weighing\nprocess or &quot;scales&quot; come into play. The prosecutor&#x27;s analogy did not misinform the jury\nand imply a presumption of death. Rather, it conveyed just the opposite: that the guilty\nverdict itself carried no weight in sentencing deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold the prosecutor&#x27;s description of the deliberative process accurately\nexplained the State&#x27;s burden to prove an aggravating circumstance and the weighing\nprocess that follows. The prosecutor&#x27;s comments were not error.\n\n\nProsecutor&#x27;s reference to Mother&#x27;s Day\n\n\n       The State&#x27;s opening statement made a single reference to Mother&#x27;s Day before\ndescribing law enforcement&#x27;s discovery of L.B.&#x27;s body: &quot;In just a few hours it will be\nMother&#x27;s Day. It&#x27;s May 11th, 2013. And at this point in the evening the sun has set,\ndarkness has fallen, and there&#x27;s a group of officers and they&#x27;re huddled together on a\nbridge.&quot; Flack argues the fact it was almost Mother&#x27;s Day was immaterial and meant to\ninflame the jurors&#x27; sympathies. We disagree.\n\n\n       Prosecutors have wide latitude when crafting opening and closing statements, so\nlong as their statements &quot;&#x27;accurately reflect the evidence, accurately state the law, and\ncannot be &quot;intended to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury or to divert the jury\nfrom its duty to decide the case based on the evidence and the controlling law.&quot;&#x27;&quot; State v.\nBodine, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">313 Kan. 378</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">486 P.3d 551</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021).

The only reference to Mother&#x27;s Day was followed\nby 11 days of testimony and evidence, so its alleged appeal to passion seems overblown.\nThe State never mentioned it again. Nor did it ever imply finding L.B.&#x27;s body just before\nMother&#x27;s Day was any worse or more tragic than any other day. The comment was within\nthe wide latitude given to prosecutors in crafting an opening statement and not error.\n\n\nBaseball analogy\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s final guilt-phase prosecutorial error challenge is to a Chicago Cubs\nanalogy the prosecutor used in rebuttal closing argument. The prosecutor stated:\n\n\n               &quot;We&#x27;ve not asked you to ignore anything. What we&#x27;ve asked you to do is look at\n       the totality, look at all of it. When you consider the defendant&#x27;s actions before the crime,\n\n                                                    45\n\f       during the crime, after the crime. When you consider the defendant&#x27;s words, his\n       statements about what happened. And then you take that and you consider other witness\n       observations, the physical and scientific evidence, when you look at all of that, all of that\n       leads to one conclusion. It&#x27;s him. It&#x27;s no one else. It&#x27;s simply him. No matter how many\n       times, no matter how many ways, the defendant&#x27;s version that there were other people\n       involved is simply not supported by evidence.\n\n\n               &quot;You know in terms of possibility, every February I&#x27;m a happy man. I&#x27;m a happy\n       man because on February 15th it&#x27;s the start of spring training and as a lifelong Chicago\n       Cubs fan, I am filled with hope because it is possible, it is possible that this could be the\n       Cubs year. But inevitably, inevitably sometimes by June, sometimes late August, it is no\n       longer possible that it&#x27;s going to be the Cubs year. I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed in terms of\n       the season. I&#x27;ll keep superstitions and I&#x27;ll have to go spit in the river now or something.\n       But there&#x27;s always possibilities, but there comes a point, just like in baseball that at some\n       point in the season it&#x27;s no longer possible that our team is going to win the pennant or our\n       team is going to go to the World Series.\n\n\n               &quot;There comes a point when it is not possible and it&#x27;s not possible because it&#x27;s not\n       supported by hard evidence. And the hard evidence, the circumstantial evidence here, all\n       overwhelmingly points to one person and one person alone.&quot;\n\n\n       Flack argues this analogy improperly sought to define reasonable doubt akin to the\npuzzle analogy disapproved of in State v. Sherman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">305 Kan. 88</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115-18, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">378 P.3d 1060</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2016). Again, we disagree.\n\n\n       In Sherman, the State showed a PowerPoint slide depicting Mount Rushmore with\nTheodore Roosevelt&#x27;s face removed. The slide contained the question, &quot;&#x27;Do you have a\nREASONABLE DOUBT this is Mt. Rushmore??&#x27;&quot; and, &quot;&#x27;Even though you can&#x27;t see all\nfour figures!!&#x27;&quot; 305 Kan. at 96. We disapproved because this analogy &quot;improperly\nequated a juror&#x27;s prior knowledge about the picture being displayed to his or her &#x27;life\nexperience.&#x27;&quot; 305 Kan. at 116. It inappropriately &quot;foster[ed] the illusion that the jurors\n                                                    46\n\falready know the full picture of the case they are hearing and are simply looking for\npieces of evidence to match it.&quot; 305 Kan. at 116. Contrary to that implication, &quot;we insist\nthat jurors have minimal to no prior knowledge of a case precisely to prevent them from\nseeking evidence to confirm a preconceived narrative and conclusion.&quot; 305 Kan. at 116.\n\n\n       Flack argues the baseball analogy just substitutes baseball wins and losses for\npieces of a puzzle. He argues the prosecutor was telling the jury it did not need to see the\nfull season play out and could turn off the TV and assume the worst &quot;based on their\nknowledge of how such things usually go.&quot; But one obvious problem with his argument\nis that the analogy does not attempt to describe reasonable doubt, let alone define it. The\nprosecution does not mention reasonable doubt until later, when it still does not try to\ndefine it.\n\n\n       Based on the context, this permissibly appealed to the jury&#x27;s common sense to\nevaluate the weaknesses in Flack&#x27;s case. See State v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4270594\"><a href=\"/opinion/4493341/state-v-butler/\">307 Kan. 831</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867-68, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4270594\"><a href=\"/opinion/4493341/state-v-butler/\">416\nP.3d 116</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018) (permissible for prosecution to say the defendant&#x27;s version of events was\nridiculous, not believable). The prosecutor specifically mentioned Flack&#x27;s claim that more\npeople were involved and used baseball to argue the evidence does not support that. He\nseems to have been saying that at some point, based on how a baseball season works, a\nteam might have so many losses it simply cannot win the season\u2014it is not possible to get\nto the World Series. By analogy, the prosecutor pointed out there was more than enough\ncontrary evidence to show Flack&#x27;s version was impossible. We hold this was not error.\n\n\n       We find no prosecutorial error during the trial&#x27;s guilt phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f                         PENALTY-PHASE PROSECUTORIAL ERROR\n\n\n       Flack alleges three prosecutorial errors that occurred in the penalty-phase closing\narguments. He claims the prosecutor erred by (1) repeatedly asking the jury to consider,\n&quot;What is justice?&quot; (2) stating facts not in evidence when he implied Flack could access\nmental health treatment in prison and stated Flack&#x27;s family would be &quot;healed&quot; regardless\nof the sentence, and (3) improperly interjecting opinion into the case by suggesting as a\n&quot;seasoned prosecutor&quot; he knew the death penalty was appropriate here. We hold no error\noccurred.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       Our standard of review for prosecutorial error claims in the penalty phase largely\nremains unchanged from the guilt phase, although, in a capital murder trial, a prosecutor\nhas a &quot;&#x27;heightened duty&#x27;&quot; to refrain from committing error due to &quot;&#x27;the life and death\nnature of the proceedings.&#x27;&quot; State v.

It is for\n         you to decide.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         At the end of the State&#x27;s pre-rebuttal closing, the prosecutor briefly returned to this\ntheme:\n\n\n                 &quot;The core issue in this case, abiding by the instructions given to you, considering\n         the facts and the circumstance that you have found to exist. Each of you will have to ask\n         . . . yourself this: What is appropriate justice? What is appropriate justice? A 21 year\n         old mother shot in the back of the head, followed by her 18 month old child shot in the\n         back. You have to make a decision, what is appropriate justice? What is appropriate\n         justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the possibility of parole? That\n         decision is for you to make.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n\n         Flack compares these comments to disapproved prosecutorial appeals to justice\nand sympathy. See, e.g., State v. Holt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924682\"><a href=\"/opinion/7972226/state-v-holt/\">300 Kan. 985</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996-99, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924682\"><a href=\"/opinion/7972226/state-v-holt/\">336 P.3d 312</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). Flack\nargues &quot;the prosecutor was clearly asking, &#x27;What is justice for them?&#x27;&quot; The State counters\nhe takes the comments out of context\u2014the prosecutor correctly set forth the penalty\nphase procedures, and he never asked the jury to return a death verdict or argued it would\nbe appropriate. Even so, Flack asserts the comments &quot;distracted the jury&quot; from its duty to\ndecide the case on the facts and the law, as given by the judge.\n\n\n         We disagree. In Holt, we determined a prosecutor erred by &quot;stating that the jury\nhas the &#x27;privilege . . . to right a wrong,&#x27; and &#x27;[y]ou and only you can right the wrong that\nthe defendant has committed in taking a young man&#x27;s life.&#x27;&quot; Holt, 300 Kan. at 999. The\nremarks were &quot;akin to asking the jury to administer justice for the victim&quot; rather than &quot;a\ngeneral appeal for justice.&quot; 300 Kan. at 999. And we noted the prosecutor &quot;&#x27;divert[ed] the\n                                             50\n\fjury from the evidence so as to obtain a conviction based upon sympathy for the victim.&#x27;&quot;\n300 Kan. at 998.\n\n\n       Our pre-Holt caselaw similarly distinguished between a general appeal for justice\nand an appeal for a jury to do justice for the criminal victims, although these cases\ngenerally declined to draw a bright line.

Nor did the prosecutor ever directly ask the jury to return a death sentence or\nsuggest that such a sentence was appropriate.\n\n\n       Indeed, the prosecutor began opening arguments with the facially neutral\nstatement that &quot;twelve well-vetted jurors from the county where the crime occurred\nshould decide this: What is justice?&quot; And the prosecutor concluded his pre-rebuttal\nclosing on a similar open-ended note: &quot;You have to make a decision, what is appropriate\njustice? What is appropriate justice? Imposition of the death penalty? Life without the\npossibility of parole? That decision is for you to make.&quot; Flack&#x27;s prosecutor did not ask for\njustice for the victims\u2014he acceptably told the jurors their job was to determine a just\nsentence.\n\n\nMental health treatment and family healing\n\n\n       Flack next argues the prosecutor erred by commenting on facts outside the\nevidence when he &quot;implied to the jury&quot; Flack would receive mental health treatment and\nhis family &quot;would be &#x27;healed&#x27; if he were sentenced to death.&quot; Flack asserts no evidence\nshows that. But these characterizations are not entirely accurate:\n\n\n               &quot;Over this time you&#x27;ve seen the sadness. Sadness can also be healing, healing.\n       Because there&#x27;s something about a case like this that when you expose bad things to the\n       light, there&#x27;s healing. There&#x27;s healing.\n\n\n\n                                                  52\n\f               &quot;You know, for the healing for the Flack family, that can occur whether there&#x27;s\n       the long journey towards execution or the long journey towards natural death. That\n       healing doesn&#x27;t stop with whatever your decision is. And during that journey hopefully\n       Mr. Flack will get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health issues.&quot;\n\n\n       &quot;A prosecutor is prohibited from arguing facts not in evidence, but generally has\nwide latitude to make arguments based on reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented at trial.&quot; State v. Novotny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923547\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971123/state-v-novotny/\">297 Kan. 1174</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7923547\"><a href=\"/opinion/7971123/state-v-novotny/\">307 P.3d 1278</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013). Here,\nFlack advances little argument beyond pointing to the statements themselves and offering\nconclusions, and he cites just one case, Chandler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4261998\"><a href=\"/opinion/4484745/state-v-chandler/\">307 Kan. 657</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But in Chandler, a\nprosecutor committed reversible error when she told the jury a nonexistent protection\nfrom abuse order had been filed against the defendant and repeatedly hammered that\nfabricated fact during her closing. 307 Kan. at 678-84. That case hardly supports Flack.\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s characterizations are overstated. First, the prosecutor&#x27;s mental health\ncomments presented only hope and desire, not fact, when he said, &quot;[H]opefully Mr. Flack\nwill get the treatment that he needs to address his mental health.&quot; (Emphasis added.) He\ndid not tell the jury Flack would receive mental health treatment, nor did he even suggest\nit was likely. And as the State points out, the record supports a reasonable inference that\nmental health treatment might be available based on testimony Flack previously received\nit in jail and prison. Second, the prosecutor&#x27;s statements about Flack&#x27;s family did not\npromise healing, just that whatever healing they may experience would happen during\n&quot;the long journey towards execution or . . . natural death&quot; and that &quot;healing doesn&#x27;t stop&quot;\nno matter the jury&#x27;s decision. At most, this statement tried to convince the jury that\nsympathy for Flack&#x27;s family should not weigh heavily in its deliberations.\n\n\n       We hold neither statement was erroneous. The prosecutor did not impermissibly\nstate facts outside of evidence during closing.\n\n                                                   53\n\fSelf-reference as &quot;seasoned prosecutor&quot; and suggesting, &quot;If not this case, what case?&quot;\n\n       Finally, Flack claims the prosecutor improperly bolstered himself as a &quot;seasoned\nprosecutor&quot; and offered his opinion that this case warranted the death penalty. The State\ncounters the prosecutor properly requested jurors determine an appropriate sentence\ngiven the facts, instructions, and weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The\nprosecutor said:\n\n\n               &quot;I ask you to take [Defense]&#x27;s argument into consideration. And I hope after all\n       this that the attorneys in this case have represented our professional best.\n\n\n               &quot;At the end of it, it comes down to what is justice? What is justice? Taking into\n       account all of the instructions, abiding by those instructions, looking at all the facts and\n       circumstances you found to exist.\n\n\n               &quot;There is a dead 21 year old mother shot in the back of the head, bound and\n       gagged with her 18 month old daughter in that room. Then there&#x27;s that 18 month old\n       daughter that is shot in the back. These cases are difficult on everyone. The question is,\n       what is justice for that scenario? For the facts and circumstances that you&#x27;ve seen here,\n       what is justice?\n\n\n               &quot;The State of Kansas, the death penalty. If not this case, what case?&quot;\n\n\n       Our law is clear: In the context of witness credibility, a prosecutor expressing an\nopinion is a form of unsworn, unchecked testimony rather than commentary on the\nevidence. State v. Pabst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316391/state-v-pabst/\">268 Kan. 501</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316391/state-v-pabst/\">996 P.2d 321</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). This tracks Rule 3.4(e)\nof the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct: &quot;A lawyer shall not . . . state a personal\nopinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil\n\n\n\n                                                    54\n\flitigant or the guilt or innocence of an accused.&quot; KRPC 3.4(e) (2023 Kan. S. Ct. R. at\n394).\n\n\n        Flack mischaracterizes the nature and intent of the prosecutor&#x27;s words. First, while\nthe prosecutor mentioned his experience as a &quot;seasoned prosecutor,&quot; he did so during voir\ndire and penalty-phase closing. During voir dire, the prosecutor asked one of the panels if\nanyone was nervous. When three of the six raised their hands, he said, &quot;[A]s you can tell\nby the color of my hair, I&#x27;m a seasoned prosecutor and I&#x27;ve handled capital murder death\npenalty cases before, also homicide cases, but I still get nervous.&quot; This statement&#x27;s\npurpose was simply to relax nervous jurors.\n\n\n        Second, the prosecutor used the phrase &quot;seasoned prosecutor&quot; during the penalty-\nphase closing colloquially to remark on his age, not to tell jurors to trust his judgment\nover their own. After discussing the weighing process instruction, he said, &quot;So you know,\nat this point as a prosecutor and as you can see I&#x27;m a seasoned prosecutor, been around\nawhile. I usually . . . zoom back in to the key place.&quot; Here, the &quot;key place&quot; was the master\nbedroom where the bodies were found. But the prosecutor really wanted &quot;to zoom in on\nthe courtroom,&quot; calling for the jurors to consider the presented facts and law.\n\n\n        Neither statement related to his separate query, &quot;If not this case, what case?&quot;\nduring penalty-phase closing. The logical leap is too large to conclude combining these\nunrelated statements told the jury the prosecutor had seen a lot of cases and felt this one\nwas deathworthy. His comments were made far apart and separately. Their combined\neffect was not error.\n\n\n        That said, it is possible the &quot;if not this case&quot; comment alone is error. As Flack\npoints out, at least two other jurisdictions have held similar comments to be error. The\n\n\n                                              55\n\fOklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals disapproved of a problematic prosecutor who had\nrun afoul of the court:\n\n\n       &quot;[T]he prosecutor improperly pleaded with the jury to do justice &#x27;and the only way you\n       can do that is bring back a sentence of death.&#x27; He also told the jury &#x27;If this isn&#x27;t a death\n       penalty case, what is?&#x27; It is error for a prosecutor . . . state his personal opinion as to the\n       appropriateness of the death penalty.&quot; (Emphasis added.) Torres v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">962 P.2d 3</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18\n       (Okla. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n\n       Although Torres does not give more context for the nearly identical statement, the\ncourt ultimately ruled the statement along with the prosecutor&#x27;s other errors were\nharmless. 962 P.2d at 18.\n\n\n       Flack&#x27;s second case, stemming from a Missouri habeas corpus petition, required\nvacating the defendant&#x27;s death sentence. There, the prosecutor spoke his opinion:\n\n\n       &quot;I&#x27;ve been a prosecutor for ten years and I&#x27;ve never asked a jury for a death penalty, but I\n       can tell you in all candor, I&#x27;ve never seen a man who deserved it more than [the\n       defendant]. By returning your verdict in this case . . . that either means that you believe\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that he pulled the trigger, or that he had the frame of mind\n       that&#x27;s consistent with pulling the trigger, and I submit to you, that [the defendant] did pull\n       the trigger, and didn&#x27;t pull it once, but pulled it twice\u2014executed an innocent man in cold\n       blood.\n\n\n                &quot;So, where do we go from there? I say to you that I never saw a man who\n       deserved it more and I say that to you in complete sincerity, and it&#x27;s my job, as I see it, to\n       tell you that.&quot; Newlon v.

If the prosecutor fails to give the notice and\nthe defendant is convicted of capital murder, the sentence will be life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole, and death penalty cannot be imposed.

The State must also\nprovide the defendant notice of all aggravating factor evidence it plans to use. See K.S.A.\n2022 Supp. 21-6617(c).

The Kleypas I\ncourt distinguished between the two notice requirements. The notice of intent allows the\ndefendant to begin their preparation for trial as it serves notice that the case will indeed\nbe a death penalty case, thus allowing them to make choices regarding the retention of\ncounsel, plea bargaining, and preparation of mitigating factors. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599107/state-v-kleypas/\">272 Kan. at 979-80</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The State met both statutory notice\nrequirements about its intent to seek the death penalty and its intended aggravating factor\nevidence. Neither statutes nor caselaw supports such a claim.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624 sets out the aggravating circumstances available for\ncapital murder:\n\n\n              &quot;(a) The defendant was previously convicted of a felony in which the defendant\n       inflicted great bodily harm, disfigurement, dismemberment or death on another.\n\n\n              &quot;(b) The defendant knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death\n       to more than one person.\n                                                 60\n\f        &quot;(c) The defendant committed the crime for the defendant&#x27;s self or another for the\npurpose of receiving money or any other thing of monetary value.\n\n\n        &quot;(d) The defendant authorized or employed another person to commit the crime.\n\n\n        &quot;(e) The defendant committed the crime in order to avoid or prevent a lawful\narrest or prosecution.\n\n\n        &quot;(f) The defendant committed the crime in an especially heinous, atrocious or\ncruel manner. A finding that the victim was aware of such victim&#x27;s fate or had conscious\npain and suffering as a result of the physical trauma that resulted in the victim&#x27;s death is\nnot necessary to find that the manner in which the defendant killed the victim was\nespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel. Conduct which is heinous, atrocious or cruel may\ninclude, but is not limited to:\n\n\n        (1) Prior stalking of or criminal threats to the victim;\n\n\n        (2) preparation or planning, indicating an intention that the killing was meant to\n        be especially heinous, atrocious or cruel;\n\n\n        (3) infliction of mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim&#x27;s death;\n\n\n        (4) torture of the victim;\n\n\n        (5) continuous acts of violence begun before or continuing after the killing;\n\n\n        (6) desecration of the victim&#x27;s body in a manner indicating a particular depravity\n        of mind, either during or following the killing; or\n\n\n        (7) any other conduct the trier of fact expressly finds is especially heinous.\n\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f               &quot;(g) The defendant committed the crime while serving a sentence of\n       imprisonment on conviction of a felony.\n\n\n               &quot;(h) The victim was killed while engaging in, or because of the victim&#x27;s\n       performance or prospective performance of, the victim&#x27;s duties as a witness in a criminal\n       proceeding.&quot;\n\n\n       Flack correctly states the heinous manner aggravator applies to &quot;the crime,&quot; not\nthe crime&#x27;s elements, but his conclusion that each killing in a multiple-killing capital\nmurder must have been committed heinously does not necessarily follow.\n\n\n       As readily seen, the aggravating circumstances apply to various subjects\u2014such as\n&quot;the defendant,&quot; &quot;the crime,&quot; and &quot;the victim&quot;\u2014between subsections. Subsection (f)\ndefines the heinous manner aggravator with both &quot;the crime&quot; and &quot;the victim.&quot; It provides\na nonexhaustive list of circumstances a jury may find heinous including conduct\nconcurrent with the act of killing or conduct not necessarily concurrent with a killing,\nsuch as prior stalking and planning or preparation. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(1)-(2).\nFinally, subsection (f) encompasses a catchall provision of &quot;any other conduct&quot; the jury\n&quot;expressly finds is especially heinous.&quot; K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6624(f)(7).\n\n\n       So, rather than requiring the heinous manner aggravator apply to each killing, the\nstatute instead focuses on whether &quot;the crime&quot; in total was committed in a heinous\nmanner. Nothing in the statute supports Flack&#x27;s reading. Under our death penalty scheme,\nany finding of an aggravating circumstance, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances,\nis sufficient to sentence the defendant to death. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e). The\nscheme does not assign weight to the number of aggravating circumstances; the finding\nof such a circumstance merely triggers the weighing process.\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\f       The State alleged the heinous manner circumstance and gave Flack notice about its\nintended evidence to prove the circumstance specifically related to Flack killing K.B.\nImposing a death sentence here did not deprive Flack of due process.\n\n\n    JURY INSTRUCTIONS: SENTENCING PROCEEDING AND DUTY-TO-REACH-VERDICT\n\n\n       Flack challenges two jury instructions from the penalty phase. He argues the first\npenalty-phase instruction that informed jurors a guilty verdict would be followed by a\nseparate sentencing proceeding erroneously implied the jury would not be responsible for\nsentencing. He also contests the verdict form alleging it told jurors they had to reach a\nunanimous decision to give him a life sentence.\n\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n       We review jury instructions under a three-step framework. First, we determine if\nthe issue was properly preserved below. Second, we consider the claim&#x27;s merits to decide\nwhether error occurred below. At this step, we consider if the challenged instruction was\nlegally and factually appropriate. We exercise unlimited review of the entire record and\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the requesting party. Finally, if there was\nerror, we examine if the error was harmless.

Gleason, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">305 Kan. 794</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800-01, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">388\nP.3d 101</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2017); Kleypas II, 305 Kan. at 305-06.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n       The first instruction told the jury that &quot;when a defendant has been found guilty of\ncapital murder, a separate sentencing proceeding shall be conducted to determine whether\nthe defendant shall be sentenced to death.&quot; (Emphasis added.) At trial, Flack requested to\n\n\n                                             63\n\freplace &quot;shall&quot; with &quot;may&quot; because it implies &quot;the jury was not ultimately responsible\nfor&quot; sentencing. The court declined, and before us Flack raises the argument again.\n\n\n       There may be a grain of truth to Flack&#x27;s claim in that a penalty phase is not needed\nif the State does not seek the death penalty. See K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(a) (requiring\nthe State give written notice within seven days of arraignment it intends to seek the death\npenalty). Otherwise, a person convicted of capital murder receives a life sentence. But his\ndesired language misstates the law because a person can only be sentenced to death if a\njury makes the necessary findings. Changing &quot;shall&quot; to &quot;may&quot; could lead the jury to\nbelieve the State had another procedural option to obtain a death sentence, and &quot;the\nuncorrected suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will\nrest with others presents an intolerable danger.&quot; Caldwell v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111471\"><a href=\"/opinion/111471/caldwell-v-mississippi/\">472 U.S. 320</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n333, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111471\"><a href=\"/opinion/111471/caldwell-v-mississippi/\">105 S.

Ed. 2d 231</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985).\n\n\n       Whether a separate sentencing proceeding happens in every capital case or only\nafter the State decides to pursue that option, the given instruction here fairly stated the\nlaw and did not mislead the jury.\n\n\n       Next, at the penalty phase&#x27;s conclusion, the court instructed the jury on completing\nthe verdict form, explaining, &quot;[I]f one or more jurors are not persuaded beyond a\nreasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating\ncircumstances, then you shall sign the appropriate alternative verdict form indicating the\njury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict sentencing the defendant to death.&quot;\n(Emphasis added.) The verdict form provided two options: (1) the standard and\nnecessary findings to impose a death sentence with space to note applicable aggravating\nfactors, and (2) &quot;We, the jury . . . state that we are unable to reach a unanimous verdict\nsentencing the defendant to death.&quot; (Emphasis added.) Over Flack&#x27;s objection the &quot;unable\n\n\n                                              64\n\fto&quot; language implied jurors must reach a unanimous verdict for or against the death\nsentence, the court declined to replace &quot;unable&quot; with &quot;did not.&quot;\n\n\n        His suggested language advances a novel reading of the death penalty sentencing\nstatutes. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617(e) provides:\n\n\n                &quot;If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or\n        more of the aggravating circumstances . . . exist and, further, that the existence of such\n        aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are\n        found to exist, the defendant shall be sentenced to death; otherwise, the defendant shall\n        be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The jury, if its verdict is a\n        unanimous recommendation of a sentence of death, shall designate in writing, signed by\n        the foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstances which it found beyond a\n        reasonable doubt. If, after a reasonable time for deliberation, the jury is unable to reach\n        a verdict, the judge shall dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of life without the\n        possibility of parole.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n\n        According to Flack, the third sentence conflicts with the first. He argues,\n&quot;Sentence one says that the inability to agree is a life verdict; sentence three seems to say\nthe inability to agree is not a verdict at all.&quot; But even if Flack&#x27;s suggested conflict exists,\nhis preferred interpretation does not materially differ from the Kleypas I court&#x27;s\nunderstanding of the statute. In Kleypas I, the court held a sentencing verdict form\nstating, &quot;&#x27;We, the jury . . . unanimously determine that a sentence as provided by law be\nimposed by the Court,&#x27;&quot; misled the jury it must reach a unanimous verdict.

K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6617&#x27;s predecessor &quot;does not require the jury to\nunanimously conclude that a death sentence is unwarranted in order to sentence the\ndefendant to a punishment other than death; rather, the jury must only fail to unanimously\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a death sentence is warranted.&quot; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599107/state-v-kleypas/\">272 Kan. at\n1062</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                                      65\n\f       Flack correctly notes the jury is not under a duty to reach a unanimous verdict, but\nhe fails to establish the given instruction might lead jurors to believe such a duty existed.\nThe instruction and verdict form accurately state the law and could not have misled the\njury. See State v. Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">308 Kan. 1488</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1505, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4346050\"><a href=\"/opinion/4568797/state-v-sims/\">431 P.3d 288</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018) (jury instructions\nreviewed &quot;together as a whole,&quot; not in isolation). The instruction informed the jury the\nsentence would be life without parole if it could not reach a verdict, and the verdict form\nprovided an option to state it could not reach a unanimous verdict of death. Nothing\nimplied it must reach a unanimous decision to impose a life sentence.\n\n\n                            EIGHTH AMENDMENT CHALLENGE\n\n\n       Flack raises a categorical Eighth Amendment challenge to his death sentence, even\nthough he acknowledges we recently addressed and rejected nearly identical claims in\nKleypas II, 305 Kan. at 328, 337, and State v. Kahler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4243802\"><a href=\"/opinion/4466549/state-v-kahler/\">307 Kan. 374</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406, 409, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4243802\"><a href=\"/opinion/4466549/state-v-kahler/\">410 P.3d\n105</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018). In both cases, counsel compared the mentally ill to intellectually disabled\npeople to establish they are less culpable for their crimes. Flack reiterates those\narguments without adding anything materially different from prior cases, so Kleypas II\ncontrols. We see no reason to revisit its holding.\n\n\n            SECTIONS 1 AND 5 OF THE KANSAS CONSTITUTION BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n\n       Flack challenges the death penalty&#x27;s constitutionality under section 1 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. We addressed the same issue in State v. Carr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">314 Kan. 615</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n625-26, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502 P.3d 546</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2022) (R.

In those cases, we characterized the argument as contending &quot;section 1\nprotects the right to life, and Kansas&#x27; capital sentencing scheme unconstitutionally\n\n\n                                             66\n\finfringes upon this right.&quot; R. Carr II, 314 Kan. at 627. We rejected that argument,\nholding:\n\n\n               &quot;The historical record reflects the framers did not intend the term &#x27;inalienable&#x27; in\n       section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights to be construed as &#x27;absolute&#x27; and\n       &#x27;nonforfeitable.&#x27; Instead, a careful reading of section 1, coupled with the transcripts of the\n       convention debate, demonstrates that the term &#x27;inalienable&#x27; refers only to one&#x27;s ability to\n       transfer his or her right or interest to another person. Though inalienable, the framers\n       viewed the natural rights guaranteed within this section to be forfeitable in civil society.\n       So construed, the framers did not intend for section 1 to impede or limit the State&#x27;s\n       authority to punish individuals for their criminal conduct.&quot; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">314 Kan. 615</span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. \u00b6 4.\n\n\n       Additionally, Flack attacked the death penalty under section 5 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights. R. Carr II also addressed that issue, as a &quot;constitutional\nchallenge to the practice of &#x27;death qualifying&#x27; juries in Kansas\u2014the process of removing\nprospective jurors for cause . . . when their conscientious objection to capital punishment\nsubstantially impairs their ability to fulfill the oath and obligations of a juror.&quot; 314 Kan.\nat 645. We rejected that argument, holding:\n\n\n       &quot;[B]oth the plain meaning and historical record confirm that a &#x27;jury&#x27; is defined as a group\n       comprised of persons who will determine issues of fact and return a decision based on the\n       evidence and in accordance with the law as instructed. Death qualification . . . removes\n       only those prospective jurors who cannot fulfill these obligations due to conscientious\n       objection to the death penalty, i.e., the statute authorizes removal of those prospective\n       jurors excluded from the constitutional definition of a &#x27;jury.&#x27; Thus, death qualification\n       facilitates the very jury trial right guaranteed by section 5. Moreover, when the Kansas\n       Constitution was adopted in 1859, the common law did not preclude, and in fact\n       authorized, this procedure. For these reasons, we hold that death qualification under\n       K.S.A. 22-3410 does not violate section 5.&quot; 314 Kan. at 653.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    67\n\f       Flack offers no new authority or argument warranting revisiting of R. Carr II.\n\n\n                                    CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n\n       Based on our rulings, the cumulative error doctrine has no application.

No errors warrant reversal of his\nconvictions or sentence.

It is true that Flack has at least gestured\ntoward applying the appropriate section 1 police power test I set forth in Hodes. But he\nhas not made any substantive argument beyond a few conclusory statements, and the\nrecord below is entirely void of any findings that might support his claim. In a future\ncase, I am open to considering the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty under\nsection 1&#x27;s limit on state police powers. But doing so would require an actual showing\nbased on something more substantial than Flack has provided to demonstrate that our\ndeath penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance of the common good.\n\n\n       So as before, given &quot;the monumental consequences of the state&#x27;s exercise of this\nmost final, most irreversible, and most grave use of power\u2014killing a human person\u2014I\nam left with a profound and unshakable disquiet about our court&#x27;s blessing upon these\nprocedures.&quot; 314 Kan. at 783 (Stegall, J., concurring). And because I cannot &quot;presume\nour death penalty is not reasonably related to the furtherance or protection of the common\ngood\u2014or that it is otherwise arbitrary, irrational, or discriminatory . . . I am left with no\noption other than to concur in the judgment.&quot; 314 Kan. at 784 (Stegall, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                              69\n\f                                             ***\n\n\n       WILSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: The majority finds\nambiguity in Kyle Flack&#x27;s many attempts to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence\nduring his interview with police in the early morning hours of May 8, 2013. I cannot\nagree. Taken collectively, I would hold Flack&#x27;s final four statements constitute an\nunequivocal invocation of his right to silence\u2014an invocation which his interrogators\nfailed to scrupulously honor. Because I view the admission of Flack&#x27;s post-invocation\nstatements to be prejudicial to his convictions for the murders of Andrew Stout and\nSteven White, I would reverse those convictions and remand for a new trial. And while I\nbelieve the evidence of Flack&#x27;s guilt for his capital murder charge was robust enough to\nprevent reversal of that conviction, I cannot conclude that the admission of Flack&#x27;s\nstatements was harmless as to his sentence of death. Thus, for the reasons below, I\nrespectfully concur in part in the result and dissent in part.\n\n\n       Our test here is ostensibly an objective one: &quot;whether a reasonable police officer\nunder the circumstances would understand the suspect&#x27;s statement as an assertion of a\nMiranda right.&quot; State v. Aguirre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924720\"><a href=\"/opinion/7972260/state-v-aguirre/\">301 Kan. 950</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 957, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7924720\"><a href=\"/opinion/7972260/state-v-aguirre/\">349 P.3d 1245</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). As the\nmajority notes, despite Flack&#x27;s failure to frame this issue under the right to silence at trial,\nwe can still consider it under K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6619(b). Slip op. at 14-15. Further,\neven without testimony on the specifics of Flack&#x27;s statements, the record before us\ncontains the best evidence available in the form of the interview video. We know the time\nand place of this interview; we can assess for ourselves Flack&#x27;s tone and manner, as well\nas the detectives&#x27; varied responses to his at-issue statements.\n\n\n       More importantly, the facts before us also reveal that the investigators&#x27; key\nconcern in the interview was &quot;finding [L.B.],&quot; who was still missing then and might\u2014for\n                                           70\n\fall they knew then\u2014still have been alive. This concern can be readily divined from\ninterviewers&#x27; questions themselves: the first thing Alexander asked Flack was &quot;if he\nknew where [L.B.] was located.&quot;\n\n\n       I mention this not because the officers&#x27; subjective understanding of Flack&#x27;s\nstatements matters to our analysis\u2014it does not\u2014but to provide context for their\nresponses to those statements. To put a finer point on it, their uncertainty over L.B.&#x27;s fate\nquashed all incentive for the detectives to treat any statement as an invocation of the right\nto silence. In other words, the detectives effectively wore blinders of incomprehension\nwhen presented with Flack&#x27;s repeated statements because they wanted to prolong the\ninterview; they wanted Flack&#x27;s statements to be ambiguous.\n\n\n       This is why the detectives&#x27; subjective understanding of Flack&#x27;s invocations is, and\nmust be, irrelevant to whether Flack invoked his right to silence. Anyone can appreciate\nthe detectives&#x27; concern for finding L.B. For all they knew at the beginning of the\ninterview, she might still have been alive, and Flack might have been the key to bringing\nher to safety. But as an appellate court, we must concentrate on the statements Flack\nmade and on whether a reasonable officer would understand that Flack was exercising his\nconstitutional right to stop the inquiry by invoking his right to remain silent. The officers&#x27;\nunderstandable concern for L.B. does not lessen their responsibility to Flack. But this\nconcern necessarily colors the detectives&#x27; responses to Flack&#x27;s statements, including the\nalleged invocations here. Thus, we must consider what Flack said\u2014and the\ncircumstances in which he said it\u2014to conclude whether a reasonable officer would have\nunderstood him to be invoking his right to silence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\f       Flack&#x27;s final four statements, collectively, were clear and unequivocal.\n\n\n       Flack points to several statements as attempted invocations of his right to silence. I\nagree with the majority that most of Flack&#x27;s earlier statements were ambiguous for the\nreasons discussed in the majority opinion. Slip op. at 16-19. But I cannot agree that\nFlack&#x27;s final four &quot;take me to jail&quot; statements\u2014the ones the majority labels as Flack&#x27;s\nseventh through tenth\u2014were ambiguous. Slip op. at 19-22. Among other possible\ninterpretations, the majority suggests that, &quot;In context, these comments show Flack\nbelieved the questioning about what happened at Stout&#x27;s house was irrelevant, rather than\nexercising a constitutional right.&quot; Slip op. at 22. It further reads Flack&#x27;s statements as\nshowing that Flack &quot;simply claimed the detectives had already made up their minds about\nhis involvement in these deaths, including their belief he could help them find the\nchild&quot;\u2014and, thus, Flack was not invoking his right to silence. Slip op. at 22.\n\n\n       But while the cold words of the transcript may lend credence to the majority&#x27;s\nposition that Flack might have meant any number of things, the way Flack said them\u2014\nalong with their repetition\u2014clarifies any ambiguity, in my view. And although an\nappellate opinion cannot entirely convey the nuanced audiovisual information presented\nin the videos of Flack&#x27;s interrogation, that information is at least as important in\nestablishing the context and meaning of Flack&#x27;s words as the words themselves. To\nclarify the basis for my dissent, then, a bit of additional description is needed.\n\n\n       As the majority notes, Flack made his final four &quot;take me to jail&quot; comments during\na portion of questioning about the identities of his violent, drug-related contacts in\nEmporia. Slip op. at 19-22. At first, as the detective began to explore Flack&#x27;s involvement\nwith these contacts, Flack abruptly said, &quot;Take me to jail,&quot; and looked down at his lap.\nThe detective asked a question. Flack did not respond, but only said, &quot;Take me to jail.&quot;\nThe detective asked another question. Flack again only said, &quot;Take me to jail.&quot; This time,\n                                           72\n\fthere was silence for several seconds. At this point, I believe Flack&#x27;s intent to invoke his\nright to remain silent became clear. Even so, the detectives again asked more questions.\nAfter answering a couple of them, Flack again said, &quot;Take me to jail.&quot; This time he\ncrossed his arms and put his head down on the table. He clearly wanted to stop the\ninterview.\n\n\n       The worst of Flack&#x27;s self-incriminating statements followed.\n\n\n       These last four statements of, &quot;Take me to jail,&quot; lacked some of the accompanying\nphrases held elsewhere to render similar statements ambiguous, and their exact repetition\nin the face of several different questions underscored what was, in my view, a clear intent\nto cut off the interview. Cf. People v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4020410\"><a href=\"/opinion/4243149/people-v-jackson/\">1 Cal. 5th 269</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336-41, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">205 Cal.

Take me to jail,&#x27;&quot;\nterminated the interview.). Any alternative interpretations of these statements strains\ncredulity, in my view: if Flack meant anything besides &quot;take me to jail,&quot; he would have\nsaid as much during one of his repetitions of the phrase. That he did not crystalizes the\nclear and unambiguous meaning of his words and their necessary implication: terminate\nthe interview by taking him to jail. Unlike the majority, I thus believe Flack&#x27;s statements\ncollectively made his meaning clear. I cannot support the majority&#x27;s speculation as to\nFlack&#x27;s meaning, that is, that he was merely expressing his belief about the irrelevance of\nthe detectives&#x27; line of questioning.\n\n\n       The State claims that Flack&#x27;s earlier, ambiguous responses taint the meaning of his\nlater ones. But we have soundly rejected such arguments in the past, and I would do so\nagain here. Cf. State v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3207517\"><a href=\"/opinion/3207623/state-v-walker/\">304 Kan. 441</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3207517\"><a href=\"/opinion/3207623/state-v-walker/\">372 P.3d 1147</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016) (earlier\nambiguous statements did not undermine the clarity of a later set of statements that\n                                         73\n\f&quot;[c]ollectively . . . would have made it clear to reasonable law enforcement officers&quot; that\na suspect was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to silence). As I have written, Flack&#x27;s\nwords\u2014and, perhaps more critically, how he said them\u2014rendered his meaning perfectly\nclear to a reasonable officer.\n\n\n       The majority also finds ambiguity in two of Flack&#x27;s responses\u2014&quot;What do you\nwant me to tell you?&quot; and, &quot;I don&#x27;t know the fuckin&#x27; people&quot;\u2014which, the majority,\nclaims, &quot;lead to a reasonable inference Flack meant &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; rather than invoking\nhis right to remain silent.&quot; Slip op. at 21-22. But the majority&#x27;s reliance on these\nstatements is flawed. Flack made the first statement between his ninth and tenth\nattempted invocations, and he made the second one after his tenth and final attempted\ninvocation. Slip op. at 21-22. In my view, Flack had already made his meaning clear, at\nthe very latest, by his ninth overall statement: the penultimate &quot;take me to jail&quot; comment.\nStatements made after an invocation cannot be used to retroactively &quot;cast doubt on the\nadequacy&quot; of that invocation, as the majority attempts to do now. E.g., Smith v. Illinois,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111288\"><a href=\"/opinion/111288/smith-v-illinois/\">469 U.S. 91</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98-99, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111288\"><a href=\"/opinion/111288/smith-v-illinois/\">105 S.

Thus, I am\ntroubled by the majority&#x27;s efforts to retroactively interpret Flack&#x27;s &quot;take me to jail&quot;\nstatements by relying on his later responses.\n\n\n       In evaluating the clarity of an alleged invocation of the right to silence, words\nmatter. Context matters. Magic words are not required. Emspak v.

When we speak of what a &quot;reasonable\nofficer&quot; would have understood, we are referring to an individual of ordinary intelligence\npossessed of ordinary linguistic comprehension skills. We are not speaking of individuals\nwho, for one reason or another, can apply the principles of arcane philosophies and\n                                            74\n\flexical sophistry to divine ambiguity where, in any ordinary conversation, there would be\nnone. A reasonable officer is not one motivated to find ambiguity no matter where or how\nhis goal finds quarter. This latter category naturally includes professional investigators\nwho may be motivated to remain, and thus do remain in the face of all evidence to the\ncontrary, doggedly &quot;uncertain&quot; about a suspect&#x27;s meaning\u2014particularly those guided by\nthe best of intentions, such as the urgent need to locate a missing child and bring her\nsafely home. See, e.g., Sadeghi, Hung Up on Semantics: A Critique of Davis v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Hastings Const. L.Q. 313</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336 (1995) (&quot;Perhaps the most troubling aspect of\nthe threshold-of-clarity approach is that it leaves the fox guarding the henhouse. The\npolice have little incentive to find that a statement was a clear invocation of rights.&quot;).\n\n\n       Yet law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and courts alike have shown over and\nover their own mastery of speculative mental gymnastics where a suspect may be\ninvoking the right to silence or the right to counsel, but not &quot;clearly so.&quot; See generally 2\nLaFave, Israel, King &amp; Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(g), n.184-85 (4th ed.) (cataloging\nmany cases finding ambiguity in &quot;even a statement which itself appears to amount to an\nassertion of the right to remain silent&quot;\u2014including the outright refusal to speak). Nor do\ncourts consider silence itself\u2014which a layperson might reasonably view as perhaps the\npurest indication that a suspect is invoking the right to silence\u2014to be a clear and\nunambiguous invocation of the right to silence. E.g., Evans v. Demosthenes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597208\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597208/evans-v-demosthenes/\">902 F. Supp.\n1253</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259-60 (D.

Some of these\nexercises in linguistic contortionism pass beyond the point of parody.

L. Rev. 151</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168\n(2011). One is forced to wonder, despite a plethora of caselaw to the contrary, whether\nmagic words are required, and even whether the magic words must be followed with\nactual silence before a suspect clearly and unambiguously invokes the right to silence\nunder the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Gee, Invoking the Right to Counsel and Right to\nRemain Silent: It&#x27;s Just Not That Clear, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">32 Miss. C. L.

The\nvery meaning of the words &quot;clearly and unambiguously&quot; strains, cracks, and sometimes\nbreaks under the burden we place upon it. This case exemplifies this deterioration.\n\n\n       In other areas of police investigation, courts often give weight\u2014if not total\ndeference\u2014to an officer&#x27;s deductions, instincts, training, and experience.

Yet in the arena of the Fifth Amendment, courts\nconstructively infantilize officers by imputing to them a basic lack of language\ncomprehension. Moreover, our legal framework provides little incentive for officers to\nexercise caution in the face of a possible invocation\u2014anything besides a precise\nrecitation of some court-approved legal formula. After all, if a court can divine any\nambiguity at all in a suspect&#x27;s statements, it will reward an officer&#x27;s constructive\n&quot;uncertainty&quot; over any language that does not contain a precise invocation incantation. In\nother words, we have created a system under which officers have little reason not to\ngamble by refusing to scrupulously honor an invocation\u2014unless, that is, it is expressed\nthrough a set of specific legal magic words.\n\n\n       Here, a reasonable detective could not have understood Flack&#x27;s repeated identical\n&quot;take me to jail&quot; statements to mean anything besides a request to terminate the interview\nand &quot;take [him] to jail.&quot; The majority&#x27;s alternative view\u2014that Flack&#x27;s responses could be\ninterpreted as merely bemoaning the futility of the detectives&#x27; line of questioning\u2014\nappears strained to me. &quot;We should not seek ambiguity where none exists&quot; to sanction\ndetectives&#x27; continued questioning in the face of an invocation of the right to silence.

Flack further admitted to\ncovering White&#x27;s body with a tarp and leaving it in the outbuilding for more than a week.\nAs the prosecutor emphasized during closing arguments, evidence suggested that White\ndied from two gunshot wounds, each caused by PDX Home Defender shotgun rounds. In\nhis pre-&quot;invocation&quot; statements, Flack admitted purchasing Defender rounds for his\nshotgun.\n\n\n       The shotgun that was partially recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014\nwhich contained a mixed DNA profile from at least three people, of whom Flack could\nnot be excluded as the major contributor\u2014fired at least one of the shell casings found in\nthe outbuilding where White was killed. Evidence also suggested that this same weapon\nfired the five shell casings recovered from the residence&#x27;s master bedroom, where the\nbodies of Stout and K.B. were found and where (based on bloodstains) evidence\nsuggested L.B. was shot. The weapon was a 12-gauge &quot;pump action&quot; shotgun that\nrequired a discrete action to eject a spent round and chamber a new round before each\nindividual shot could be fired. Evidence suggested that Flack owned a 12-gauge pump\naction shotgun that he kept at Stout&#x27;s property, of which he was &quot;proud.&quot; One witness\nnoted that Flack &quot;had [the shotgun] with him everywhere he went&quot; and that he had even\nslept next to it at times. In his pre-&quot;invocation&quot; statements, Flack admitted that he owned\na &quot;Remington 1300.&quot;\n\n\n\n                                              80\n\f       In closing arguments, the prosecutor noted the lack of forensic evidence of a\nstruggle surrounding White&#x27;s death and highlighted evidence suggesting White was shot\nin the outbuilding. The prosecutor also emphasized Flack&#x27;s own statement:\n\n\n               &quot;And consider finally the defendant&#x27;s own description of that particular incident.\n       I shot him, he dies. He indicated to law enforcement, I shot him and at the time I shot\n       him, he claims Andrew Stout shot him first, but he indicates that I shot him, he was still\n       alive when I shot him and he dies. Those are the defendant&#x27;s own words.&quot;\n\n\n       But while the evidence suggests that White was killed in the outbuilding on Stout&#x27;s\nproperty, possibly with the shotgun partially recovered from the Emporia dump, major\nuncertainties exist surrounding the timing and circumstances of White&#x27;s killing. White\nwas last seen alive on April 20, 2013. As Flack points out, jurors heard testimony that\nseveral individuals were at the residence around this time, including Joseph Berger,\nbrothers Andrew and Rocky Helm, Dylan Phillips, Stout, and Flack, among others. Some\nof these guests fired weapons at Stout&#x27;s property\u2014a &quot;good shooting spot.&quot; Jurors also\nheard testimony that White and Stout &quot;butted heads often.&quot;\n\n\n       The State highlights evidence that Flack &quot;discouraged&quot; his friends from contacting\nthe authorities about White&#x27;s disappearance. The State highlights circumstantial evidence\nsuggesting that Flack killed Stout, L.B., and K.B., which further implies that Flack also\nkilled White; as the State puts it, Flack &quot;was the only person of that group to walk away\nfrom the residence alive.&quot; But while this may be a reasonable extrapolation, it does not\nestablish no reasonable possibility that Flack&#x27;s confession to killing White affected the\njury&#x27;s verdict. In particular, the killing of White stands apart in both time and place from\nthe killings of Stout, K.B., and L.B., who were all killed several days after White and\ninside the residence, rather than the outbuilding. In my view, the forensic evidence\nsuggesting Flack&#x27;s guilt is not overwhelming enough to overcome the prejudicial effect of\n\n                                                   81\n\fhis direct confession to White&#x27;s murder. Thus, I would reverse his conviction for White&#x27;s\nmurder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       Stout&#x27;s Killing\n\n\n       Stout was shot four times with a shotgun, including once in the back. Shell casing\nevidence suggested that the shotgun that was partially recovered from an Emporia\nrecycling center was used in the killing of White, Stout, K.B., and L.B. While Stout was\nfound in the same bedroom as K.B.&#x27;s body (where L.B. was also likely shot), the\nevidence suggests he was killed at least a few days before them\u2014between April 28 and\n30, 2013, rather than between May 1 and May 5.\n\n\n       Surveillance camera evidence established that Flack accompanied Stout on a trip\nto Ottawa on April 28. On that trip, Stout wore the same shirt in which he ultimately died.\nCircumstantial evidence suggests that Flack further accompanied Stout to Emporia,\nalthough the surveillance camera evidence is less clear on this point. Yet this evidence\nstill does not directly place Flack at Stout&#x27;s residence at the time of Stout&#x27;s killing,\nalthough it may suggest that he was still with Stout at that time. Additionally, Flack&#x27;s\nfingerprints were present on items in the bedroom where Stout and K.B. were found.\nEvidence also placed Flack at Stout&#x27;s residence around and after the time Stout was likely\nkilled, and Flack made false statements to others concerning Stout&#x27;s whereabouts after\nStout&#x27;s death. For instance, when Phillips stopped by on April 29, he met only Flack, who\ntold him that Stout was running errands before work.\n\n\n       Unlike White&#x27;s killing, little evidence supported the presence of other individuals\nat the residence\u2014other than Flack\u2014during the timeframe of Stout&#x27;s killing. Flack&#x27;s brief\nadmits that evidence existed to establish Flack&#x27;s presence at the house after Stout&#x27;s death,\nthat Flack made false statements about seeing Stout after he would have been dead, and\n                                           82\n\fthat Flack &quot;disposed of the shotgun used to shoot Mr. Stout.&quot; But Flack points out that\u2014\nother than his statements\u2014there is no evidence he was present at the precise time of\nStout&#x27;s death, much less that he was the shooter. While that much could be inferred from\nhis later actions\u2014not the least of which was remaining at the house afterward\u2014any such\ninferences cannot overcome the prejudicial impact of the admission of his statements,\nincluding his admission that he was present at the time of Stout&#x27;s death. Additionally,\nwhile circumstantial evidence could support the inference that Flack was using Stout&#x27;s\nphone after his death, that inference could not then support a new inference that,\ntherefore, Flack was Stout&#x27;s killer. Cf. State v. Colson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">312 Kan. 739</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">480 P.3d 167</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2021) (inference stacking is prohibited). Moreover, any error resulting from the\nadmission of Flack&#x27;s statements vis-\u00e0-vis the killing of White\u2014to which he admitted\u2014\nwould also infect the jury&#x27;s (otherwise justifiable) inference that Flack was, in fact,\nStout&#x27;s killer. That the jury ultimately convicted Flack of second-degree murder for\nStout&#x27;s death further suggests some uncertainty about the circumstances of this killing,\nthough I do not propose to read the tea leaves of the jury&#x27;s verdict.\n\n\n       Consequently, while the circumstantial evidence supported Flack&#x27;s conviction for\nStout&#x27;s murder, it is not overwhelming enough to rule out all reasonable possibility that\nthe erroneous admission of Flack&#x27;s statements affected the jury&#x27;s verdict. Thus, I would\nalso reverse Flack&#x27;s conviction for Stout&#x27;s murder and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n       The Killing of L.B. and K.B.\n\n\n       In closing, the prosecutor focused heavily on forensic evidence to establish that\nL.B. and K.B. were killed close in time to one another. But the prosecutor asked jurors to\n&quot;consider his words to law enforcement&quot;:\n\n\n\n                                             83\n\f       &quot;He was correctly able to inform law enforcement what the order of death was. Steven\n       White first, Andrew Stout second, [K.B.] third, [L.B.] last. There&#x27;s only one way that you\n       know that. There&#x27;s only one way. You were there and you did it.\n\n\n               &quot;He correctly knew the location of the bodies. He knew that Steven White was in\n       the outbuilding. He knew that Andrew Stout was in the corner. He knew that [K.B.] was\n       buried near the bed. Now he claims he didn&#x27;t know where [L.B.] was, but he did indicate\n       that she was in a suitcase and that she was wrapped in a blanket. He also correctly\n       described the [s]tate of [K.B.]&#x27;s body, her clothing or lack thereof.\n\n\n               &quot;Now in the defendant&#x27;s statements to law enforcement there were at least eight\n       versions and there are significant inconsistencies between each of the versions. It&#x27;s for\n       you to judge and determine and assess the credibility of all those different versions and\n       what inconsistencies there are.\n\n\n               &quot;But the inconsistencies all have something in common. They are designed to\n       take the focus and responsibility off of the defendant. It&#x27;s always, you know, Andrew shot\n       Steven White. Oh, Omar and Chewie, they&#x27;re the ones that shot Andrew Stout and [K.B.]\n       and [L.B.]. I was just there. He puts himself there during the murders but he&#x27;s always got\n       a little bit less of a responsibility. Yet he has all these details and there&#x27;s all this evidence\n       that all points to one person and one person alone, the defendant.&quot;\n\n\n       In my view, the circumstantial evidence here appears strong enough to eliminate\nany reasonable possibility that the prosecutor&#x27;s insinuation that Flack had &quot;all these\ndetails&quot; affected the jury&#x27;s verdict. Unlike the killing of White and Stout, the evidence\nsurrounding the deaths of L.B. and K.B. effectively rules out any lesser degrees of\nhomicide beyond premeditated first-degree murder. K.B. was gagged, naked from the\nwaist down, and had her hands bound behind her back with zip ties at the time of her\ndeath. She was shot in the back of the neck by a shotgun while prone or kneeling on the\nground. Her body was later turned face up and she was covered with a pile of clothes.\nAfter the clothes were placed atop K.B.&#x27;s body, 18-month-old L.B. was shot in the back\n                                                      84\n\fwith a shotgun while facing the direction of her mother&#x27;s body. Forensic evidence about\nthe contents of K.B.&#x27;s and L.B.&#x27;s stomachs further suggests that both were killed on the\nafternoon of May 1, 2013.\n\n\n       Moreover, the circumstantial evidence supporting a finding that Flack was directly\ninvolved in the killing of L.B. and K.B. is stronger than that supporting his convictions\nfor the killing of White and Stout. For instance, cell phone data suggested that Flack was\nlikely present at the residence on May 1 and May 2, 2013. On May 3, 2013, cell phone\ndata suggested that Flack began the day at the residence, then moved within a mile-and-a-\nhalf from the place where L.B.&#x27;s body was found, and then traveled to Emporia, where his\nphone remained. Flack subsequently got a new phone.\n\n\n       A little after 5 p.m. on May 7, 2013, cameras captured images of an individual\ndriving K.B.&#x27;s car to an apartment parking lot near 12th and East streets in Emporia. The\ndriver got out and threw away a bag from the car into a nearby dumpster. The bag\ncontained items belonging to K.B. and L.B., including L.B.&#x27;s baby blanket. Douglas\npicked Flack up from the parking lot of Do-B&#x27;s restaurant sometime after 5 p.m. on the\nevening of May 7, 2013; this parking lot would have been very close to the parking lot\nwhere K.B.&#x27;s car was left. Circumstantial evidence thus suggested that Flack was driving\nK.B.&#x27;s car and was attempting to dispose of her and L.B.&#x27;s property.\n\n\n       Like White and Stout, L.B. and K.B. were killed with a shotgun. Beyond the\nevidence that the shotgun recovered from the Emporia recycling center\u2014which was\nFlack&#x27;s\u2014fired several casings recovered from the residence, one of the shot shells fired\nfrom the shotgun was found on K.B.&#x27;s leg. Finally, perhaps the strongest circumstantial\nevidence of Flack&#x27;s involvement in the killings can be found from the black zip ties in\nFlack&#x27;s bag, which were much like the ones used to bind K.B.\n\n\n                                            85\n\f       Admittedly, the DNA evidence collected from K.B.&#x27;s body did not strongly\nimplicate Flack. For instance, the major DNA profile taken from the knot of the bandana\nused to gag K.B. fit K.B.&#x27;s DNA, but Flack could not be excluded as the source of the\nminor profile contribution\u2014although that minor profile would be consistent with the\nDNA of one in eight individuals. This evidence further suggested that Flack had touched\nand, perhaps, even tied the bandana used to gag K.B. Further, although Flack could not\nbe excluded as a contributor to samples containing mixed DNA profiles obtained from\nK.B.&#x27;s left hand fingernail clippings, this match was also weak\u2014about a 1-in-28 chance.\nMoreover, Flack could be excluded as a contributor to DNA samples collected from\nunder K.B.&#x27;s right hand fingernail clippings. No conclusion could be reached as to\nwhether Flack contributed to male DNA recovered from K.B.&#x27;s pubic hair.\n\n\n       Despite the somewhat lukewarm DNA evidence, I believe the remaining\ncircumstantial evidence of Flack&#x27;s guilt is overwhelming enough to render the erroneous\nadmission of his statements harmless as to his conviction for killing L.B. and K.B. These\nkillings occurred close together in time and space and could, realistically, only have\nresulted from intentional and premeditated conduct. Thus, I concur in the result of the\nmajority&#x27;s decision to affirm Flack&#x27;s capital murder conviction.\n\n\n       Harmlessness\u2014Penalty Phase\n\n\n       I turn next to the harmlessness of the error in the penalty phase of Flack&#x27;s trial.\nFlack argues that his statements amplified the State&#x27;s description of K.B.&#x27;s last moments,\neliminated &quot;residual&quot; doubt, and made him appear unsympathetic and remorseless before\nthe jury.\n\n\n       But even if Flack&#x27;s statements did not affect the jury&#x27;s finding about the existence\nof aggravating circumstances, I find it probable that they affected the jury&#x27;s weighing of\n                                            86\n\faggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jury watched Flack give the detectives\nseveral versions of events, as the prosecution repeatedly highlighted. This could have led\nthe jury to conclude that Flack was a remorseless killer who deserved to die for his\ncrimes.\n\n\n       Because I find it probable that Flack&#x27;s statements impacted at least some of the\nindividual jurors&#x27; assessment of the mitigating circumstances, I would vacate Flack&#x27;s\nverdict of death and remand for a new sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n\n       Conclusion\n\n\n       A &quot;right&quot; to silence which cannot be exercised in practice\u2014even by actual\nsilence\u2014is no right at all. Because the majority&#x27;s analysis undermines the exercise of the\nconstitutional right to silence by implicitly penalizing Flack for failing to utter the proper\nincantation\u2014despite his repeated, clear requests that the detectives take him to jail, which\nwould necessarily terminate the interview\u2014I respectfully dissent. All the same, I concur\nin affirming Flack&#x27;s conviction for capital murder, as I believe the evidence of his guilt to\nbe overwhelming enough to neutralize the prejudicial effect of the erroneous admission\nof Flack&#x27;s statements. Likewise, I concur with the majority&#x27;s analysis about Flack&#x27;s\nremaining claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                              87\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/105306/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/106786/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107359/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109336/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110914/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111288/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111303/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111471/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145632/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/165392/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/529744/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1119533/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1161008/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1186371/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1208231/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1316391/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1421196/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1448656/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1801680/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2331394/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2357282/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2387820/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2413231/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2453676/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2543599/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2551229/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2584200/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2597208/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2599107/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2614940/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2623147/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2627094/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2645639/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3152697/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3207517/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4016071/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4020410/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4243802/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4261998/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4266071/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4270594/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4318667/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4346050/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4375337/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4391247/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/5600824/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7241207/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923313/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923368/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923412/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7923547/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924640/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924664/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924682/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7924720/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925369/", "id": 9925369, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467531/arlington-heights-police-pension-fund-v-pritzker/", "cluster_id": 9467531, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467531/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:03:57.349126-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:11:48.305424-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "25803fbbda6f8096cf54a0a00f38ec1d920f1d88", "page_count": 11, "download_url": "https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/resources/0d29732a-eef2-48d1-a1d4-4b0fb7603bd6/file", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/arlington_heights_police_pension_fund_v._pritzker.pdf", "plain_text": "                                       2024 IL 129471\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 129471)\n\n      THE ARLINGTON HEIGHTS POLICE PENSION FUND et al., Appellants,\n           v.

Jan. 1, 2020)\n     (Act), which amended portions of the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1-101 et.\n     seq. (West 2020)), violated article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill.\n     Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5), commonly known as the pension protection clause,\n\f     and/or article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 15),\n     commonly known as the takings clause. The circuit court granted summary\n     judgment in favor of defendants. The appellate court affirmed. 2023 IL App (2d)\n     220198, \u00b6 20. For the following reasons, we also affirm.\n\n\n\u00b62                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On January 1, 2020, Public Act 101-610 became effective and amended, in\n     pertinent part, portions of the pension code to consolidate all applicable local police\n     and firefighter pension fund assets into two statewide pension investment funds,\n     one for police and the other for firefighters. Pursuant to the Act, the local pension\n     funds were required to transfer custody and investment responsibility for their fund\n     assets to the respective statewide funds, which are now tasked with collectively\n     investing and administering the pooled assets. The Act provided a transition period\n     that ended on June 30, 2022, for the transfer of securities, assets, and the investment\n     function from the local funds to the statewide investment funds. See 40 ILCS\n     5/22B-120, 22C-120 (West 2020).\n\n\u00b64       Under the Act, each local fund retains a separate account in the respective\n     statewide fund. Those assets are dedicated solely to paying benefits to the local\n     fund\u2019s members and to covering operating expenses. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1-109; 22B-118(c), (e);\n     22C-118(c), (e). The Act specifies that the \u201coperations and financial condition of\n     each participating pension fund account shall not affect the account balance of any\n     other participating pension fund.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-118(c), 22C-118(c). The returns on\n     the investments in the statewide funds are then \u201callocated and distributed pro rata\n     among each participating pension fund account in accordance with the value of the\n     pension fund assets attributable to each fund.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b65       The purpose of the Act is \u201cto streamline investments and eliminate unnecessary\n     and redundant administrative costs, thereby ensuring more money is available to\n     fund pension benefits for the beneficiaries of the transferor pension funds.\u201d Id.\n     \u00a7\u00a7 22B-114, 22C-114. The two investment fund boards created by the Act are\n     composed of nine members: three officers or executives from participating\n     municipalities, three active participants of the local funds who are elected by active\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f     participants, two beneficiaries 1 from the local funds who are elected by\n     beneficiaries of the funds, and one member recommended by the Illinois Municipal\n     League who is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-\n     115(b), 22C-115(b). In addition, the Act authorizes the Illinois Finance Authority\n     (IFA) to lend money, if requested by the local funds, to pay the necessary transition\n     costs to the new statewide funds. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-120(h), 23C-120(h). Any such loans\n     are to be repaid with interest. Id.\n\n\u00b66       There are approximately 650 local police and firefighter pension funds for\n     municipalities in Illinois with populations between 5000 and 500,000, and the Act\n     does not eliminate any of them. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-103, 4-103. These local funds continue\n     to be governed by five-member boards composed of two appointed members, two\n     members elected by active members, and one member elected by and from the\n     beneficiaries. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-128, 4-121. The Act specifically provides that these local\n     boards retain exclusive authority to adjudicate and award retirement and other\n     benefits. The new statewide investment funds \u201cshall not have the authority to\n     control, alter, or modify, or the ability to review or intervene in, the proceedings or\n     decisions\u201d of the local pension boards. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-124.3, 4-117.2. Therefore, the\n     enactment of the Act had no impact on the local pension boards\u2019 responsibility to\n     determine the retirement, disability, and death benefits payable to fund members\n     and other beneficiaries.\n\n\u00b67       In February 2021, plaintiffs, 36 individual active and retired beneficiary\n     members from a small number of suburban and downstate police and firefighter\n     pension funds, filed a three-count complaint against Governor Jay Robert \u201cJ.B.\u201d\n     Pritzker; Christopher Meister, executive director of the IFA; Dana Severinghaus,\n     acting director of the Illinois Department of Insurance; the Board of Trustees for\n     the Police Officers\u2019 Pension Investment Fund; and the Board of Trustees for the\n     Firefighters\u2019 Pension Investment Fund. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive,\n     and other relief, including a finding that the Act violated the pension protection\n     clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5) (count I) and/or\n\n\n\n          1 The fund board for local police has two members directly from the population of beneficiaries;\n\n     the fund board for firefighters has one beneficiary member and one member recommended by the\n     statewide labor organization representing firefighters from at least 85 municipalities, who is then\n     appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. See id. \u00a7 22C-115(b)(3), (5).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       the Illinois Constitution\u2019s contracts clause (id. art. I, \u00a7 16) (count II) and/or the\n       Illinois Constitution\u2019s takings clause (id. \u00a7 15) (count III). 2\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the Act diminishes and impairs their pension\n       benefits because, (1) prior to the Act, the local funds could \u201cexclusively manage\n       and control their investment expenditures and income\u201d; (2) their \u201cvoting power and\n       thereby an effective say in the selection of investment managers, investments, risks,\n       rates of return, costs and expenses\u201d was diluted by the participation of members of\n       other local funds; and (3) the local funds must bear the costs associated with the\n       Act\u2019s transition process, including repayment of any IFA transition loans.\n\n\u00b69          On cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court entered judgment in\n       favor of defendants and against plaintiffs. 3 As to count I, the circuit court found\n       that precedent from this court instructs that the \u201cbenefits\u201d protected by the pension\n       protection clause are limited to those that affect the value of a member\u2019s pension\n       benefit. The circuit court found the Act did not violate the clause because plaintiffs\n       were not denied a \u201cbenefit\u201d that could be tied to a change in the value of their\n       retirement payments. As to count III, plaintiffs\u2019 takings clause claim, the circuit\n       court found that, because the clause applies only to government action against real\n       property, which is not at issue here, the Act did not implicate that constitutional\n       provision.\n\n\u00b6 10       On appeal, plaintiffs only challenged the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to counts I and\n       III of the complaint. 2023 IL App (2d) 220198, \u00b6 5. Concerning count I, the\n       appellate court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that voting rights are protected\n       benefits under the pension protection clause. Id. \u00b6 14. The court found that benefits\n       outside of pension payments that have been held to constitute benefits for purposes\n       of the clause are generally only those that affect a participant\u2019s continued\n       participation in a pension system or their ability to increase their service credits,\n       thereby affecting the calculation of eventual benefit payments. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n\n\n           2\n              The complaint also named as plaintiffs 18 local police or firefighter pension funds. The circuit\n       court dismissed these plaintiffs for lack of standing. This ruling was not challenged in the appellate\n       court, nor is it raised in this court.\n            3\n              Prior to the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 countermotion for summary judgment, the circuit court\n       dismissed count II of the complaint after finding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under\n       the contracts clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\f       appellate court concluded that the ability to vote in elections for local pension board\n       members is not such a benefit, nor is the ability to have local board members control\n       and invest pension funds. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 11       The appellate court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Act impairs and\n       diminishes their benefits by requiring local funds to pay startup and administrative\n       costs, as well as transition costs, for the new statewide pension investment funds.\n       Id. \u00b6 15. The court found that plaintiffs failed to explain how such costs impair or\n       diminish payment of their benefits. Id. Additionally, the court noted that the Act\n       does not require the local funds to borrow money to pay for the costs or for them to\n       spend any specific amount. Id.\n\n\u00b6 12       As to count III, the appellate court held that, because plaintiffs have no property\n       right in any particular assets or level of funding and are entitled only to present or\n       future payments from the funds, they could not establish the private property\n       requirement for their takings clause claim. Id. \u00b6 18. The court concluded that\n       plaintiffs do not own the funds that are to be transferred to the new statewide funds.\n       Id.\n\n\u00b6 13       For these reasons, the appellate court held that the circuit court correctly ruled\n       that summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate on counts I and III of\n       the complaint. Id. \u00b6 20.\n\n\u00b6 14       This court granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a)\n       (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). This court also allowed the Illinois Municipal League and the\n       Associated Firefighters of Illinois leave to file amicus curiae briefs in support of\n       defendants\u2019 position. Ill. S. Ct. R. 345(a) (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 15                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 16       We first address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the circuit court erred in granting\n       defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because the Act violates the pension\n       protection clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5).\n       Plaintiffs assert that the Act does not conform to the requirements of this clause\n       because it impairs the rights of members to vote in the election of local police and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       firefighter pension boards and to have those boards control and invest the local\n       pension funds.\n\n\u00b6 17       Summary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine issue of material\n       fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-\n       1005(c) (West 2020). By filing cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties\n       invite the court to decide the questions presented as a matter of law. Carmichael v.\n       Laborers\u2019 & Retirement Board Employees\u2019 Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago,\n       2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 21. We apply a de novo standard of review to summary judgment\n       rulings. Id.\n\n\n\u00b6 18                               I. Pension Protection Clause\n\n\u00b6 19        Article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution provides that \u201c[m]embership\n       in any pension or retirement system of the State, any unit of local government or\n       school district, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, shall be an enforceable\n       contractual relationship, the benefit of which shall not be diminished or impaired.\u201d\n       Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5.\n\n\u00b6 20        This clause of our constitution has been construed by this court on numerous\n       occasions. We have repeatedly held that the pension protection clause means\n       precisely what it says: \u201cif something qualifies as a benefit of the enforceable\n       contractual relationship resulting from membership in one of the State\u2019s pension or\n       retirement systems, it cannot be diminished or impaired.\u201d Kanerva v. Weems, 2014\n       IL 115811, \u00b6 38; id. \u00b6 40 (holding that subsidized health care provided to state\n       employees was a benefit of membership in a state retirement system protected by\n       the pension protection clause). The protections afforded to pension benefits by\n       article XIII, section 5, attach once an individual first embarks upon employment in\n       a position covered by a public retirement system, not when the employee ultimately\n       retires. In re Pension Reform Litigation, 2015 IL 118585, \u00b6 46. Those benefits\n       therefore cannot be later unilaterally diminished or eliminated by the legislature.\n       Id. \u00b6 46 n.12.\n\n\u00b6 21        Accordingly, once an individual begins work and becomes a member of a public\n       retirement system, any subsequent changes to the Pension Code that would\n       diminish the benefits conferred by membership in the retirement system cannot be\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       applied to that individual. Id. \u00b6 46. \u201cThe primary purpose of article XIII, section 5,\n       was to eliminate any uncertainty surrounding the payment of public pension\n       benefits and to clarify that state and local governments were obligated to provide\n       pension benefits to their employees.\u201d Matthews v. Chicago Transit Authority, 2016\n       IL 117638, \u00b6 57.\n\n\u00b6 22       This court has further explained that the pension protection clause \u201c \u2018protects\n       all of the benefits that flow from the contractual relationship arising from\n       membership in a public retirement system.\u2019 \u201d Williamson County Board of\n       Commissioners v. Board of Trustees of the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund,\n       2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 32 (quoting Matthews, 2016 IL 117638, \u00b6 54). The benefits\n       protected include \u201cthose benefits attendant to membership in the State\u2019s retirement\n       system, such as subsidized health care, disability and life insurance coverage, and\n       eligibility to receive a retirement annuity and survivor benefit [citations], along\n       with the right to purchase optional service credit in the state pension system for past\n       military service.\u201d Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 25.\n\n\u00b6 23       Plaintiffs claim that the lower courts failed to appreciate this precedent and the\n       breadth of the phrase \u201cany benefit\u201d contained in our pension protection clause.\n       Plaintiffs argue that their voting rights are impacted by the Act and that voting\n       rights are a benefit that cannot be altered. They assert that prior to the adoption of\n       the Act they had the right to vote and exercise greater control over locally managed\n       boards and pension funds. The Act, according to plaintiffs, \u201csubstantially impacted\n       and diluted\u201d their voting rights and their rights to control the management of the\n       funds. Consequently, plaintiffs claim it was erroneous for the lower courts to find\n       that these rights were not the kind of benefits protected by our constitution.\n\n\u00b6 24       In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely heavily upon Williamson County.\n       There, the plaintiffs were elected members of the Williamson County Board of\n       Commissioners and had satisfied the requirements of the Pension Code to\n       participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF). Williamson County,\n       2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 5. The Pension Code was subsequently amended to add a\n       requirement for a county board to adopt an IMRF participation resolution within 90\n       days of each election when a member of the county board is elected or reelected.\n       Id. \u00b6 8. The Williamson County Board failed to adopt such a resolution within the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       required time frame, and the plaintiffs\u2019 participation in IMRF was terminated. Id.\n       \u00b6 12.\n\n\u00b6 25       This court found that the amendment to the Pension Code was unconstitutional\n       because the legislature\u2019s unilateral decision to create the provision contained in\n       section 7-137.2(a) (40 ILCS 5/7-137.2(a) (West 2016)) imposed a new requirement\n       for continued IMRF participation that did not exist when the plaintiffs began their\n       public employment. Williamson County, 2020 IL 125330, \u00b6 47. The defendants did\n       not contest the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they would qualify for continued\n       participation in the fund but for the new requirement that all county boards certify\n       within 90 days of each general election that their county board members are\n       required to work sufficient hours to meet the applicable hourly standard. Id.\n\n\u00b6 26       Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Williamson County is misplaced. There, the newly\n       created requirement in the Pension Code could eliminate the monetary benefits of\n       members and did not exist when the plaintiffs began their public employment and\n       participation in IMRF. Therefore, in marked contrast to the instant case, the\n       constitutional violation in the new legislation in Williamson County was\n       specifically tied to its effect of eliminating monetary benefits for existing members.\n\n\u00b6 27       Generally, as the appellate court below recognized, the benefits outside of\n       pension payments that have been found to constitute benefits for purposes of the\n       pension protection clause are those that affect a participant\u2019s ability to continue\n       participation or increase service credits, thereby negatively affecting calculation of\n       eventual benefit payments. See, e.g., Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 65 (holding\n       that amendment to the Pension Code that eliminated the ability of the plaintiffs to\n       purchase service credit during a leave of absence to work for a local union was an\n       improper new requirement placed on pension benefits); Buddell v. Board of\n       Trustees, State University Retirement System, 118 Ill. 2d 99, 106-07 (1987)\n       (holding that change to employees\u2019 right to purchase optional service credit for time\n       spent in military service was an improper new requirement placed on pension\n       benefits). In Carmichael, we also listed, as examples of the benefits protected by\n       the pension protection clause, \u201csubsidized health care, disability and life insurance\n       coverage, and eligibility to receive a retirement annuity and survivor benefits.\u201d\n       Carmichael, 2018 IL 122793, \u00b6 25.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f\u00b6 28       In contrast, the ability to vote in elections for local pension board members is\n       not such a constitutionally protected benefit, nor is the ability to have local board\n       members control and invest pension funds. See Kanerva, 2014 IL 115811, \u00b6 48\n       (holding that the pension protection clause was aimed at protecting the right to\n       receive the promised retirement benefits, not the adequacy of the funding to pay for\n       them); McNamee v. State, 173 Ill. 2d 433, 444 (1996) (holding that the pension\n       protection clause does not create a contractual basis for participants to expect a\n       particular level of funding but only a contractual right that they would receive the\n       money due them at the time of their retirement).\n\n\u00b6 29       It is axiomatic that, if plaintiffs have no constitutional right in how their local\n       pension funds are funded or the adequacy of that funding, they similarly have no\n       constitutional right regarding who invests local fund assets. The Act does not\n       change plaintiffs\u2019 right to elect members of their local funds\u2019 boards or the local\n       boards\u2019 authority to determine the amount of benefits plaintiffs are entitled to\n       receive. It only changes the local boards\u2019 power to invest the assets of the local\n       funds. Simply put, the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code has no impact on\n       plaintiffs receiving their promised monetary benefits.\n\n\u00b6 30       Plaintiffs further argue that the Act impairs and diminishes their benefits in\n       violation of the pension protection clause by requiring local funds to pay start-up,\n       administration, and operation costs for the new funds, plus interest if any amount\n       is borrowed from the IFA. Plaintiffs argue that the appellate court ignored this\n       concern by stating that the funds must already pay administration costs and that\n       there is no evidence that the costs of the new funds would be any greater. Plaintiffs\n       assert that these liabilities and encumbrances did not exist before the Act and\n       constitute a further violation of the pension protection clause.\n\n\u00b6 31       This contention also lacks merit. Plaintiffs do not explain how the payment of\n       the startup costs impairs or diminishes payment of their pension benefits. The Act\n       does not require the borrowing or the spending of any specific amount for the\n       startup or administrative costs of the funds. Additionally, as previously noted, the\n       two new statewide funds are intended to streamline investments and eliminate\n       unnecessary and redundant costs, thereby ensuring that more money is available to\n       fund local police and firefighter pension benefits. See 40 ILCS 5/22B-114, 22C-\n       114 (West 2020).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f\u00b6 32       For these reasons, we find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment\n       in defendants\u2019 favor on count I of the complaint.\n\n\n\u00b6 33                                     II. Takings Clause\n\n\u00b6 34       We next turn to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the circuit court erred in granting\n       defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because the Act violates the takings\n       clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 15). Plaintiffs contend\n       that, because the Act requires them \u201cto fully transfer all of their private property,\n       comprised of their securities, funds, assets, monies, and cash reserves\u201d to the\n       statewide pension investment funds, and because the Act requires them to bear the\n       financial costs of transition, as well as to pay the costs and expenses incurred in the\n       operation and administration of the funds, their private property has been taken\n       and/or damaged in violation of the takings clause.\n\n\u00b6 35       Article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution provides that \u201c[p]rivate\n       property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation as\n       provided by law. Such compensation shall be determined by a jury as provided by\n       law.\u201d Id. We have defined a taking as \u201ca physical invasion of private property or\n       the radical interference with a private property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of the\n       property.\u201d Tzakis v. Maine Township, 2020 IL 125017, \u00b6 45. \u201cOne of the principal\n       purposes of the Takings Clause is \u2018to bar Government from forcing some people\n       alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by\n       the public as a whole.\u2019 \u201d Northern Illinois Home Builders Ass\u2019n v. County of\n       Du Page, 165 Ill. 2d 25, 31-32 (1995) (quoting Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S.\n       374, 384 (1994)).\n\n\u00b6 36       As the appellate court correctly concluded, the Act does not take any of\n       plaintiffs\u2019 private property. As participants in a defined benefit plan, they have a\n       right to receive their promised benefits but do not somehow have a private property\n       right in the source of funding for those payments. Plaintiffs claim that the Act\n       requires them to fully transfer ownership of their private property, comprising the\n       securities and other fund assets. The Act does not operate in that manner. It simply\n       changes the control and management of the local funds\u2019 assets from one\n       government-created pension fund to another type of government-created pension\n       fund. As defendants assert, although plaintiffs have a constitutional right to receive\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       the benefit payments promised to them, which the Act does not change, they do not\n       have a property right to any particular level of assets used to pay those benefits or\n       in the way those assets are held or invested.\n\n\u00b6 37       Plaintiffs have failed to identify any property right under Illinois law that is\n       affected by the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code. It is undisputed that the Act\n       does not impact the pension payments that plaintiffs are entitled to receive.\n       Additionally, as defendants recognize, plaintiffs\u2019 takings claim must also fail\n       because even if they had a property right in the local funds\u2019 assets, which they do\n       not, the Act would not constitute a taking of that property for the government\u2019s use.\n       The Act simply changes how local fund assets are managed and invested without\n       affecting the ultimate use of those assets to pay the benefits of local fund members.\n\n\u00b6 38      Consequently, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in\n       defendants\u2019 favor on count III of the complaint.\n\n\n\u00b6 39                                    CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 40       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court\n       affirming the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor\n       and against plaintiffs.\n\n\n\u00b6 41      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 129471</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 129471)\n\n      THE ARLINGTON HEIGHTS POLICE PENSION FUND et al., Appellants,\n           v.

For the following reasons, we also affirm.\n\n\n\u00b62                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On January 1, 2020, Public Act 101-610 became effective and amended, in\n     pertinent part, portions of the pension code to consolidate all applicable local police\n     and firefighter pension fund assets into two statewide pension investment funds,\n     one for police and the other for firefighters. Pursuant to the Act, the local pension\n     funds were required to transfer custody and investment responsibility for their fund\n     assets to the respective statewide funds, which are now tasked with collectively\n     investing and administering the pooled assets. The Act provided a transition period\n     that ended on June 30, 2022, for the transfer of securities, assets, and the investment\n     function from the local funds to the statewide investment funds. See 40 ILCS\n     5/22B-120, 22C-120 (West 2020).\n\n\u00b64       Under the Act, each local fund retains a separate account in the respective\n     statewide fund. Those assets are dedicated solely to paying benefits to the local\n     fund\u2019s members and to covering operating expenses. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9368958\"><a href=\"/opinion/9373482/arlington-heights-police-pension-fund-v-pritzker/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> \u00a7\u00a7 1-109; 22B-118(c), (e);\n     22C-118(c), (e). The Act specifies that the \u201coperations and financial condition of\n     each participating pension fund account shall not affect the account balance of any\n     other participating pension fund.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-118(c), 22C-118(c). The returns on\n     the investments in the statewide funds are then \u201callocated and distributed pro rata\n     among each participating pension fund account in accordance with the value of the\n     pension fund assets attributable to each fund.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b65       The purpose of the Act is \u201cto streamline investments and eliminate unnecessary\n     and redundant administrative costs, thereby ensuring more money is available to\n     fund pension benefits for the beneficiaries of the transferor pension funds.\u201d Id.\n     \u00a7\u00a7 22B-114, 22C-114. The two investment fund boards created by the Act are\n     composed of nine members: three officers or executives from participating\n     municipalities, three active participants of the local funds who are elected by active\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f     participants, two beneficiaries 1 from the local funds who are elected by\n     beneficiaries of the funds, and one member recommended by the Illinois Municipal\n     League who is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-\n     115(b), 22C-115(b). In addition, the Act authorizes the Illinois Finance Authority\n     (IFA) to lend money, if requested by the local funds, to pay the necessary transition\n     costs to the new statewide funds. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 22B-120(h), 23C-120(h). Any such loans\n     are to be repaid with interest. Id.\n\n\u00b66       There are approximately 650 local police and firefighter pension funds for\n     municipalities in Illinois with populations between 5000 and 500,000, and the Act\n     does not eliminate any of them. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-103, 4-103. These local funds continue\n     to be governed by five-member boards composed of two appointed members, two\n     members elected by active members, and one member elected by and from the\n     beneficiaries. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-128, 4-121. The Act specifically provides that these local\n     boards retain exclusive authority to adjudicate and award retirement and other\n     benefits. The new statewide investment funds \u201cshall not have the authority to\n     control, alter, or modify, or the ability to review or intervene in, the proceedings or\n     decisions\u201d of the local pension boards. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-124.3, 4-117.2. Therefore, the\n     enactment of the Act had no impact on the local pension boards\u2019 responsibility to\n     determine the retirement, disability, and death benefits payable to fund members\n     and other beneficiaries.\n\n\u00b67       In February 2021, plaintiffs, 36 individual active and retired beneficiary\n     members from a small number of suburban and downstate police and firefighter\n     pension funds, filed a three-count complaint against Governor Jay Robert \u201cJ.B.\u201d\n     Pritzker; Christopher Meister, executive director of the IFA; Dana Severinghaus,\n     acting director of the Illinois Department of Insurance; the Board of Trustees for\n     the Police Officers\u2019 Pension Investment Fund; and the Board of Trustees for the\n     Firefighters\u2019 Pension Investment Fund. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive,\n     and other relief, including a finding that the Act violated the pension protection\n     clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5) (count I) and/or\n\n\n\n          1 The fund board for local police has two members directly from the population of beneficiaries;\n\n     the fund board for firefighters has one beneficiary member and one member recommended by the\n     statewide labor organization representing firefighters from at least 85 municipalities, who is then\n     appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. See id. \u00a7 22C-115(b)(3), (5).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       the Illinois Constitution\u2019s contracts clause (id. art. I, \u00a7 16) (count II) and/or the\n       Illinois Constitution\u2019s takings clause (id. \u00a7 15) (count III). 2\n\n\u00b68         Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the Act diminishes and impairs their pension\n       benefits because, (1) prior to the Act, the local funds could \u201cexclusively manage\n       and control their investment expenditures and income\u201d; (2) their \u201cvoting power and\n       thereby an effective say in the selection of investment managers, investments, risks,\n       rates of return, costs and expenses\u201d was diluted by the participation of members of\n       other local funds; and (3) the local funds must bear the costs associated with the\n       Act\u2019s transition process, including repayment of any IFA transition loans.\n\n\u00b69          On cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court entered judgment in\n       favor of defendants and against plaintiffs. 3 As to count I, the circuit court found\n       that precedent from this court instructs that the \u201cbenefits\u201d protected by the pension\n       protection clause are limited to those that affect the value of a member\u2019s pension\n       benefit. The circuit court found the Act did not violate the clause because plaintiffs\n       were not denied a \u201cbenefit\u201d that could be tied to a change in the value of their\n       retirement payments. As to count III, plaintiffs\u2019 takings clause claim, the circuit\n       court found that, because the clause applies only to government action against real\n       property, which is not at issue here, the Act did not implicate that constitutional\n       provision.\n\n\u00b6 10       On appeal, plaintiffs only challenged the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to counts I and\n       III of the complaint. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9368958\"><a href=\"/opinion/9373482/arlington-heights-police-pension-fund-v-pritzker/\">2023 IL App (2d) 220198</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 5. Concerning count I, the\n       appellate court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that voting rights are protected\n       benefits under the pension protection clause. Id. \u00b6 14. The court found that benefits\n       outside of pension payments that have been held to constitute benefits for purposes\n       of the clause are generally only those that affect a participant\u2019s continued\n       participation in a pension system or their ability to increase their service credits,\n       thereby affecting the calculation of eventual benefit payments. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n\n\n           2\n              The complaint also named as plaintiffs 18 local police or firefighter pension funds. The circuit\n       court dismissed these plaintiffs for lack of standing. This ruling was not challenged in the appellate\n       court, nor is it raised in this court.\n            3\n              Prior to the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 countermotion for summary judgment, the circuit court\n       dismissed count II of the complaint after finding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under\n       the contracts clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\f       appellate court concluded that the ability to vote in elections for local pension board\n       members is not such a benefit, nor is the ability to have local board members control\n       and invest pension funds. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 11       The appellate court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Act impairs and\n       diminishes their benefits by requiring local funds to pay startup and administrative\n       costs, as well as transition costs, for the new statewide pension investment funds.\n       Id. \u00b6 15. The court found that plaintiffs failed to explain how such costs impair or\n       diminish payment of their benefits. Id. Additionally, the court noted that the Act\n       does not require the local funds to borrow money to pay for the costs or for them to\n       spend any specific amount. Id.\n\n\u00b6 12       As to count III, the appellate court held that, because plaintiffs have no property\n       right in any particular assets or level of funding and are entitled only to present or\n       future payments from the funds, they could not establish the private property\n       requirement for their takings clause claim. Id. \u00b6 18. The court concluded that\n       plaintiffs do not own the funds that are to be transferred to the new statewide funds.\n       Id.\n\n\u00b6 13       For these reasons, the appellate court held that the circuit court correctly ruled\n       that summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate on counts I and III of\n       the complaint. Id. \u00b6 20.\n\n\u00b6 14       This court granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a)\n       (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). This court also allowed the Illinois Municipal League and the\n       Associated Firefighters of Illinois leave to file amicus curiae briefs in support of\n       defendants\u2019 position. Ill. S.

Const. 1970, art. XIII, \u00a7 5).\n       Plaintiffs assert that the Act does not conform to the requirements of this clause\n       because it impairs the rights of members to vote in the election of local police and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       firefighter pension boards and to have those boards control and invest the local\n       pension funds.\n\n\u00b6 17       Summary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine issue of material\n       fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-\n       1005(c) (West 2020).

They assert that prior to the adoption of\n       the Act they had the right to vote and exercise greater control over locally managed\n       boards and pension funds. The Act, according to plaintiffs, \u201csubstantially impacted\n       and diluted\u201d their voting rights and their rights to control the management of the\n       funds. Consequently, plaintiffs claim it was erroneous for the lower courts to find\n       that these rights were not the kind of benefits protected by our constitution.\n\n\u00b6 24       In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely heavily upon Williamson County.\n       There, the plaintiffs were elected members of the Williamson County Board of\n       Commissioners and had satisfied the requirements of the Pension Code to\n       participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF). Williamson County,\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4538756\"><a href=\"/opinion/4758409/williamson-county-board-of-commissioners-v-board-of-trustees-of-the/\">2020 IL 125330</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 5.

The Williamson County Board failed to adopt such a resolution within the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       required time frame, and the plaintiffs\u2019 participation in IMRF was terminated.

There, the newly\n       created requirement in the Pension Code could eliminate the monetary benefits of\n       members and did not exist when the plaintiffs began their public employment and\n       participation in IMRF. Therefore, in marked contrast to the instant case, the\n       constitutional violation in the new legislation in Williamson County was\n       specifically tied to its effect of eliminating monetary benefits for existing members.\n\n\u00b6 27       Generally, as the appellate court below recognized, the benefits outside of\n       pension payments that have been found to constitute benefits for purposes of the\n       pension protection clause are those that affect a participant\u2019s ability to continue\n       participation or increase service credits, thereby negatively affecting calculation of\n       eventual benefit payments.

The Act does not\n       change plaintiffs\u2019 right to elect members of their local funds\u2019 boards or the local\n       boards\u2019 authority to determine the amount of benefits plaintiffs are entitled to\n       receive. It only changes the local boards\u2019 power to invest the assets of the local\n       funds. Simply put, the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code has no impact on\n       plaintiffs receiving their promised monetary benefits.\n\n\u00b6 30       Plaintiffs further argue that the Act impairs and diminishes their benefits in\n       violation of the pension protection clause by requiring local funds to pay start-up,\n       administration, and operation costs for the new funds, plus interest if any amount\n       is borrowed from the IFA. Plaintiffs argue that the appellate court ignored this\n       concern by stating that the funds must already pay administration costs and that\n       there is no evidence that the costs of the new funds would be any greater. Plaintiffs\n       assert that these liabilities and encumbrances did not exist before the Act and\n       constitute a further violation of the pension protection clause.\n\n\u00b6 31       This contention also lacks merit. Plaintiffs do not explain how the payment of\n       the startup costs impairs or diminishes payment of their pension benefits. The Act\n       does not require the borrowing or the spending of any specific amount for the\n       startup or administrative costs of the funds. Additionally, as previously noted, the\n       two new statewide funds are intended to streamline investments and eliminate\n       unnecessary and redundant costs, thereby ensuring that more money is available to\n       fund local police and firefighter pension benefits.

Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 15). Plaintiffs contend\n       that, because the Act requires them \u201cto fully transfer all of their private property,\n       comprised of their securities, funds, assets, monies, and cash reserves\u201d to the\n       statewide pension investment funds, and because the Act requires them to bear the\n       financial costs of transition, as well as to pay the costs and expenses incurred in the\n       operation and administration of the funds, their private property has been taken\n       and/or damaged in violation of the takings clause.\n\n\u00b6 35       Article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution provides that \u201c[p]rivate\n       property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation as\n       provided by law.

The Act does not operate in that manner. It simply\n       changes the control and management of the local funds\u2019 assets from one\n       government-created pension fund to another type of government-created pension\n       fund. As defendants assert, although plaintiffs have a constitutional right to receive\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       the benefit payments promised to them, which the Act does not change, they do not\n       have a property right to any particular level of assets used to pay those benefits or\n       in the way those assets are held or invested.\n\n\u00b6 37       Plaintiffs have failed to identify any property right under Illinois law that is\n       affected by the 2020 amendment to the Pension Code. It is undisputed that the Act\n       does not impact the pension payments that plaintiffs are entitled to receive.\n       Additionally, as defendants recognize, plaintiffs\u2019 takings claim must also fail\n       because even if they had a property right in the local funds\u2019 assets, which they do\n       not, the Act would not constitute a taking of that property for the government\u2019s use.\n       The Act simply changes how local fund assets are managed and invested without\n       affecting the ultimate use of those assets to pay the benefits of local fund members.\n\n\u00b6 38      Consequently, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in\n       defendants\u2019 favor on count III of the complaint.\n\n\n\u00b6 39                                    CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 40       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court\n       affirming the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor\n       and against plaintiffs.\n\n\n\u00b6 41      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/117861/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2011309/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2197410/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2721070/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2808937/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/3216868/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4412067/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4538756/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4587716/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6984825/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9368958/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925368/", "id": 9925368, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467530/city-of-rock-falls-v-aims-industrial-services-llc/", "cluster_id": 9467530, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467530/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:03:56.335134-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:48:55.283627-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "9234e9356c3c5503af8902005a400d892a557d9c", "page_count": 10, "download_url": "https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/resources/b1b66187-7717-49d6-8626-55fc2c9e6f75/file", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/city_of_rock_falls_v._aims_industrial_services_llc.pdf", "plain_text": "                                        2024 IL 129164\n\n\n\n                                           IN THE\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                            THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                      (Docket No. 129164)\n\n THE CITY OF ROCK FALLS, Appellee, v.

The petition sought to compel Aims\u2019s\n      compliance with a City ordinance requiring that, upon the sale or transfer of any\n      property located within the City limits that is served by a private sewage disposal\n      system, the private system be abandoned and replaced with a connection to the\n\f     City\u2019s public sewage disposal system. Following a bench trial, the trial court\n     determined that it would be inequitable to award the City an injunction and, on that\n     basis, denied the City\u2019s petition. The appellate court reversed the trial court, holding\n     that, because the City sought the enforcement of an ordinance that specifically\n     authorized injunctive relief, the trial court erred in weighing the equities when\n     deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s petition. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U. For the\n     reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On March 3, 2017, Aims purchased a commercial property located within the\n     City at 2103 Industrial Park Road. The property was serviced by a private sewage\n     disposal system rather than the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n\n\u00b64       At the time Aims purchased the property, it was governed by section 32-189(g)\n     of the Rock Falls Municipal Code (Code). This provision states:\n\n            \u201cUpon sale or transfer of property all private sewage disposal systems\n        within the city limits shall connect to the public sanitary sewer when available\n        in accordance with sections 32-186 and 32-190, a direct connection shall be\n        made to the public sewer, and the private sewage disposal system shall be\n        abandoned and shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with granular materials.\n        The county health department shall be notified and inspect the abandoned septic\n        system prior to any remedial actions being taken.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code,\n        \u00a7 32-189(g) (eff. Aug. 21, 2018).\n\n\u00b65      Under section 32-189(g), whether a public sanitary sewer is \u201cavailable\u201d for\n     connection is determined by reference to sections 32-186 and 32-190 of the Code.\n     See Rock Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-186 (adopted July 7, 2015); Rock Falls\n     Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-190 (eff. Sept. 15, 2015). These provisions state:\n\n            \u201cNo person having his residence or place of business within the territorial\n        limits of the city shall be permitted to dispose of sewage of such residence or\n        place of business located in the city otherwise than through the sewer mains of\n        the city whenever the sewer mains of the sewerage system of the city are\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f        adjacent to his property, without the written permission of the council.\u201d Rock\n        Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-186 (adopted July 7, 2015).\n\n             \u201cThe owner of each house, building or property used for human occupancy,\n        employment, recreation or any other purpose, situated within the city is\n        required, at his expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein, meeting the\n        requirements of the state *** plumbing code, and to connect such facilities\n        directly with the public wastewater treatment system in accordance with the\n        provisions of this division, and within 60 days after official notice to so connect.\n        This provision shall be effective provided that there [is] a wastewater treatment\n        system main located: (i) within 300 feet of the property line of a property\n        utilized for residential purposes; (ii) within 300 feet of the property line of a\n        property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow of\n        less than 1,500 gallons per day; or, (iii) within 1,000 feet of the property line of\n        a property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow\n        of 1,500 gallons per day or greater.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-190 (eff.\n        Sept. 15, 2015).\n\n\u00b66        In addition, section 1-41(n) of the Code authorizes the City to seek injunctive\n     relief for continuous violations of the Code:\n\n        \u201cViolations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public\n        nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The\n        imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief.\u201d Rock Falls\n        Municipal Code, \u00a7 1-41(n) (eff. July 5, 2017).\n\n\u00b67       Following its purchase of the property, Aims was notified by the City that it\n     was required to connect to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system pursuant to\n     section 32-189(g) of the Code. However, Aims did not do so.\n\n\u00b68       Thereafter, on August 5, 2019, the City filed a verified petition for injunctive\n     and other relief to compel Aims\u2019s compliance with the sewage disposal provisions\n     of the Code. The petition sought the imposition of a fine as well as a mandatory\n     injunction requiring Aims to abandon its private sewage disposal system and\n     connect to the public sewage disposal system by a date certain to be determined by\n     the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f\u00b69         The case proceeded to a bench trial. Nathan Simonton, an estimator from a civil\n       engineering firm, testified regarding the construction work that would be required\n       to connect the property to the public sewage disposal system as well as the\n       estimated cost for such work. He stated that it would cost approximately $150,000\n       to connect the property to the public sewer using a gravity system of waste disposal.\n       This included the cost of installing lateral connectors\u2014sewage lines that run from\n       a property to the main sewer line. He also stated that an alternative method of\n       connection involving the use of an electric pump would cost approximately\n       $51,000.\n\n\u00b6 10       Robin Blackert, the City\u2019s administrator, testified that in 2020 the City\n       approved an ordinance pursuant to section 32-186 of the Code that excused another\n       business located within the City from the requirement of connecting to the public\n       sewage system. According to Blackert, the City passed the ordinance because\n       connecting to the public sewage disposal system would have been cost prohibitive\n       and an undue hardship on the business. Aims had sought a similar exclusion from\n       the City prior to trial but was denied.\n\n\u00b6 11       At the conclusion of trial, the trial court noted that, while the City had requested\n       the imposition of a fine in its petition, that request had effectively been abandoned\n       during the proceedings and the only question before the court was whether\n       injunctive relief was appropriate. On that issue, the trial court found that section\n       32-189(g) of the Code had been triggered by Aims\u2019s purchase of the property in\n       2017 and that Aims had not connected to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n       The court further found that the City had met its burden of establishing that a public\n       sewer with a daily sewage flow of less than 1500 gallons per day was located within\n       300 feet of the property, as required for the sewer to be considered \u201cavailable\u201d for\n       connection within the meaning of section 32-189(g), and that Aims had not been\n       granted the City council\u2019s written permission to continue the use of its private\n       sewage disposal. Nevertheless, the court denied the City\u2019s petition.\n\n\u00b6 12       Emphasizing that it was \u201csitting as a court in equity,\u201d the trial court determined\n       that it was required to balance the equities between the parties when ruling on the\n       City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The court noted that no evidence had been\n       produced to show that Aims\u2019s private sewage system was failing or that it presented\n       a threat to public health. The court also noted that connecting to the public sewage\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f       disposal system would be expensive, imposing a hardship on Aims, and that the\n       City had granted an exception to another commercial property owner in the past. In\n       addition, although the trial court found it \u201creasonable\u201d for the City to require\n       property owners to connect to the public sewage system, the court stated it had \u201ca\n       hard time understanding\u201d why the sale or transfer of a property triggered that\n       requirement. The court concluded: \u201cHaving done what can be called the balancing\n       in equity, because that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about, the fairness to everybody,\n       the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief is denied.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 13       The City appealed, arguing that the trial court had no authority to balance the\n       equities when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The\n       appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. 2022 IL App\n       (4th) 220208-U.\n\n\u00b6 14       Before addressing the availability of injunctive relief, the appellate court noted\n       that language in the trial court\u2019s order indicated that it had both incorporated a\n       comparative cost analysis and had considered the absence of lateral connectors\n       when determining whether a connection to the public sewage disposal system was\n       \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of the Code. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21-32. The appellate court\n       concluded that this was error and that the availability of a connection was defined\n       solely under the terms of sections 32-186 and 32-190 of the Code. Id. \u00b6 32. The\n       appellate court further held that the requirements of both these provisions had been\n       established by the City. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n\u00b6 15        The appellate court then addressed \u201cwhether it was appropriate for the trial\n       court to balance the hardships when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request\n       for injunctive relief.\u201d Id. \u00b6 42. The appellate court acknowledged that, when a suit\n       is brought in equity seeking injunctive relief, the general rule is that the trial court\n       must balance the equities between the parties. Id. \u00b6 44. The court stated, however,\n       that \u201cwhere a governmental agency is expressly authorized by statute to seek\n       injunctive relief, the traditional equitable elements necessary to obtain an injunction\n       need not be satisfied.\u201d Id. \u00b6 45. Relying upon People ex rel. Sherman v. Cryns, 203\n       Ill. 2d 264 (2003), and Sadat v. American Motors Corp., 104 Ill. 2d 105 (1984), the\n       appellate court explained that, because there is a presumption of harm to the public\n       when an ordinance is violated, a governmental agency seeking an injunction need\n       only show that the ordinance was violated and that the ordinance specifically\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       provides for injunctive relief. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U, \u00b6 45. The court\n       concluded, therefore, in this case, that the City had to prove only that Aims violated\n       the Code and that the Code specifically authorized injunctive relief as a remedy. Id.\n       \u00b6 50. As such, the construction work and cost required to connect to the City\u2019s\n       sewage system, as well as the exemption granted to the other business, were\n       irrelevant. Id. In reaching this result, the appellate court declined to follow County\n       of Kendall v. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App. 3d 529, 539 (2004), wherein the court held\n       that a trial court may balance the equities even when a statute expressly authorizes\n       a governmental agency to seek injunctive relief. 2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U, \u00b6 49.\n\n\u00b6 16       We allowed Aims\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff. Oct.\n       1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                                        ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 18       Before this court, Aims does not challenge the appellate court\u2019s holding that a\n       connection to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system was available within the\n       meaning of the Code. Instead, Aims contends only that the appellate court erred in\n       holding that the trial court lacked the authority to weigh the equities when ruling\n       on the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The City, in response, contends that the\n       appellate court correctly determined that the trial court lacked any such authority.\n\n\u00b6 19       The City does not dispute that, when a suit is filed in equity seeking mandatory\n       injunctive relief, the moving party must establish that it has no adequate remedy at\n       law, that it possesses a certain and clearly ascertainable right, and that it will suffer\n       irreparable harm if no relief is granted. See, e.g., Sadat, 104 Ill. 2d at 116. In\n       addition, the trial court is generally required to balance the equities before awarding\n       the injunction. See, e.g., Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 86 Ill. 2d 1,\n       28-29 (1981) (citing Haack v. Lindsay Light & Chemical Co., 393 Ill. 367, 375\n       (1946)). The City points out, however, in this case the City did not file a suit in\n       equity but at law, and its petition sought an injunction pursuant to the Code rather\n       than the trial court\u2019s inherent equitable authority. Given this fact, the City contends\n       that the trial court\u2019s discretion was limited by the rule set forth by this court in\n       Cryns.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f\u00b6 20       In Cryns, the Director of Professional Regulation filed a verified petition for\n       injunctive relief alleging that the defendant, a lay midwife, had violated the Nursing\n       and Advanced Practice Nursing Act (225 ILCS 65/20-75(a) (West 2000)). Cryns,\n       203 Ill. 2d at 266. The section of the statute that authorized injunctive relief\n       provided:\n\n          \u201cIf any person violates the provision of this Act, the Director may, in the name\n          of the People of the State of Illinois, through the Attorney General of the State\n          of Illinois, or the State\u2019s Attorney of any county in which the action is brought,\n          petition for an order enjoining such violation or for an order enforcing\n          compliance with this Act. Upon the filing of a verified petition in court, the\n          court may issue a temporary restraining order, without notice or bond, and may\n          preliminarily and permanently enjoin such violation ***.\u201d 225 ILCS 65/20-\n          75(a) (West 2000).\n\n       Addressing the availability of injunctive relief under this provision, this court\n       explained the standard to be applied:\n\n          \u201cUnder section 20-75 of the Act (225 ILCS 65/20-75 (West 2000)), the Director\n          is authorized to petition the circuit court for an injunction against any individual\n          who is practicing nursing without a license. Where, as here, the State or a\n          governmental agency is expressly authorized by statute to seek injunctive relief,\n          the traditional equitable elements necessary to obtain an injunction need not be\n          satisfied. Sadat v. American Motors Corp., 104 Ill. 2d 105, 111-13 (1984); see\n          People v. Van Tran Electric Corp., 152 Ill. App. 3d 175, 184 (1987); People\n          ex rel. Hartigan v. Stianos, 131 Ill. App. 3d 575, 580 (1985). The State or the\n          agency seeking the injunction need only show that the statute was violated and\n          that the statute relied upon specifically allows injunctive relief. Sadat, 104 Ill.\n          2d at 111-13; see Midland Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Elmhurst, 226 Ill. App.\n          3d 494, 504 (1993). This principle of law is animated by the rationale that\n          because statutes authorizing injunctive relief often do so on behalf of a public\n          official in his or her capacity as the enforcer of a regulatory scheme, \u2018the\n          violation of such a statute implies an injury to the general public [and] [s]uch\n          injury necessitates the statutory authorization for equitable relief and supplants\n          the traditional equitable pleading requirements.\u2019 Sadat, 104 Ill. 2d at 113. It is\n          presumed that public harm occurs when a statute is violated. See Midland, 226\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f          Ill.

App. 3d at 580 (\u2018The principle underlying\n          the willingness of the courts to issue statutory injunctions to public bodies to\n          restrain violations of a statute is that harm to the public at large can be presumed\n          from the statutory violation alone\u2019). Once it has been established that a statute\n          has been violated, no discretion is vested in the circuit court to refuse to grant\n          the injunctive relief authorized by that statute. See Midland, 226 Ill. App. 3d at\n          504.\u201d Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d at 277-78.\n\n\u00b6 21       Cryns recognized the distinction between a suit seeking injunctive relief\n       pursuant to a court\u2019s inherent equitable authority and one seeking relief pursuant to\n       a statute. In the latter situation, the equities have, in effect, already been balanced\n       by the legislative body, and that balance is reflected in the policy choices contained\n       within the statute. A court is not free to disregard or \u201crebalance\u201d the policy\n       determinations made by a legislative body. See, e.g., Roselle Police Pension Board\n       v. Village of Roselle, 232 Ill. 2d 546, 557 (2009). Accordingly, when a trial court is\n       confronted \u201cwith a continuing violation of statutory law, it has no discretion or\n       authority to balance the equities so as to permit that violation to continue.\u201d Zygmunt\n       J.B. Plater, Statutory Violations and Equitable Discretion, 70 Cal. L. Rev. 524, 527\n       (1982); see also, e.g., 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions \u00a7 25 (October 2023 Update) (\u201cA\n       statutory request for injunctive relief is governed by the requirements of the statute,\n       and express statutory language supersedes common-law requirements.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 22       Aims briefly contends that Cryns is inapposite because that case concerned the\n       application of a statute rather than, as in this case, municipal ordinances. We\n       disagree. It is well settled that \u201c[a] municipal ordinance has the force of law over\n       the community in which it is adopted and, within the corporate limits, operates as\n       effectively as a law passed by the legislature.\u201d City of Chicago v. Roman, 184 Ill.\n       2d 504, 511 (1998). Like a statute, the sewage ordinances at issue in this case were\n       enacted by a legislative body and have the full force of law. Moreover, there has\n       been no suggestion that the ordinances are in some manner unconstitutional or\n       otherwise improper. See, e.g., Hutchinson v. City of Valdosta, 227 U.S. 303, 308\n       (1913) (noting that \u201c[i]t is the commonest exercise of the police power of a State or\n       city to provide for a system of sewers and to compel property owners to connect\n       therewith\u201d). We conclude that Cryns applies to the municipal ordinances at issue\n       here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f\u00b6 23        Aims also cites the appellate court\u2019s decision in Rosenwinkel in support of its\n       contention that the trial court in this case had the authority to balance the equities.\n       At issue in Rosenwinkel was whether the plaintiff, the County of Kendall, was\n       entitled to a mandatory injunction ordering the removal of a grain bin that had been\n       constructed in violation of a county zoning ordinance. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App.\n       3d at 532. Addressing the legal standard to be applied, the appellate court\n       acknowledged this court\u2019s decision in Cryns. Id. at 539. However, the appellate\n       court read Cryns as holding that a law authorizing injunctive relief only relieves the\n       governmental body of proving the \u201cthree traditional elements\u201d for an injunction,\n       i.e., a lack of an adequate remedy at law, a certain and clearly ascertainable right,\n       and irreparable harm if no relief is granted. Id. at 539-40. Thus, according to\n       Rosenwinkel, even in those situations where a law authorizes a governmental body\n       to seek a mandatory injunction and a violation of that law has been proven, the trial\n       court must still balance the equities before granting injunctive relief. Id. at 539. This\n       is incorrect.\n\n\u00b6 24       Cryns was explicit in holding that, \u201c[o]nce it has been established that a statute\n       has been violated, no discretion is vested in the circuit court to refuse to grant the\n       injunctive relief authorized by that statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d at\n       278. Further, Rosenwinkel\u2019s conclusion that a trial court must balance the equities,\n       even if a law expressly providing for injunctive relief has been violated, cannot\n       stand. Such a rule would effectively permit a trial court to second-guess the\n       legislative body as to whether a particular regulatory scheme was equitable or\n       otherwise in the best interests of the public, even though such decisions fall\n       squarely within the realm of legislative determinations. See, e.g., Fumarolo v.\n       Chicago Board of Education, 142 Ill. 2d 54, 62-63 (1990) (it is not for the judiciary\n       to decide the \u201cwisdom or unwisdom of legislative action in determining the means\n       to be adopted to resolve an existing social problem\u201d).\n           Rosenwinkel cited Midland Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Elmhurst, 226 Ill. App.\n       3d 494, 504 (1993), in support of its holding that a trial court is always required to\n       balance the equities. Rosenwinkel, 353 Ill. App. 3d at 539. However, as the\n       appellate court below correctly noted, Midland does not stand for the proposition\n       that a trial court may engage in an \u201copen-ended balancing of the equities in a case\n       seeking enforcement of a municipal ordinance.\u201d 2022 IL App (4th) 220208, \u00b6 48.\n       Indeed, Midlands was cited by this court in Cryns in support of the rule that a trial\n       court has \u201cno discretion\u201d to refuse to grant injunctive relief once it has been\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f       established that a statute authorizing such relief has been violated. Cryns, 203 Ill.\n       2d at 278.\n\n\u00b6 25       Rosenwinkel\u2019s holding that a trial court must balance the equities even under a\n       statute that expressly provides for injunctive relief cannot be reconciled with this\n       court\u2019s decision in Cryns. Accordingly, to the extent that Rosenwinkel conflicts\n       with Cryns, it is overruled.\n\n\u00b6 26       In this case, section 1-41(n) of the Code expressly authorized the City to seek\n       injunctive relief for continuous violations of the City\u2019s sewage ordinances,\n       including the failure to connect to the public sewage disposal system. Thus, the only\n       question to be determined by the trial court was whether the City had met its burden\n       of establishing a continuous violation (id. at 277-78), and the appellate court\n       correctly held that the trial court had no discretion to balance the equities. The\n       judgment of the appellate court reversing the judgment of the trial court is therefore\n       affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 27                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 28      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 29      Appellate court judgment affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 30      Circuit court judgment reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 129164</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                           IN THE\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                            THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                      (Docket No. 129164)\n\n THE CITY OF ROCK FALLS, Appellee, v.

The petition sought to compel Aims\u2019s\n      compliance with a City ordinance requiring that, upon the sale or transfer of any\n      property located within the City limits that is served by a private sewage disposal\n      system, the private system be abandoned and replaced with a connection to the\n\f     City\u2019s public sewage disposal system. Following a bench trial, the trial court\n     determined that it would be inequitable to award the City an injunction and, on that\n     basis, denied the City\u2019s petition. The appellate court reversed the trial court, holding\n     that, because the City sought the enforcement of an ordinance that specifically\n     authorized injunctive relief, the trial court erred in weighing the equities when\n     deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s petition. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (4th) 220208-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">. For the\n     reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       On March 3, 2017, Aims purchased a commercial property located within the\n     City at 2103 Industrial Park Road. The property was serviced by a private sewage\n     disposal system rather than the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n\n\u00b64       At the time Aims purchased the property, it was governed by section 32-189(g)\n     of the Rock Falls Municipal Code (Code). This provision states:\n\n            \u201cUpon sale or transfer of property all private sewage disposal systems\n        within the city limits shall connect to the public sanitary sewer when available\n        in accordance with sections 32-186 and 32-190, a direct connection shall be\n        made to the public sewer, and the private sewage disposal system shall be\n        abandoned and shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with granular materials.\n        The county health department shall be notified and inspect the abandoned septic\n        system prior to any remedial actions being taken.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code,\n        \u00a7 32-189(g) (eff. Aug. 21, 2018).\n\n\u00b65      Under section 32-189(g), whether a public sanitary sewer is \u201cavailable\u201d for\n     connection is determined by reference to sections 32-186 and 32-190 of the Code.\n     See Rock Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-186 (adopted July 7, 2015); Rock Falls\n     Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-190 (eff. Sept. 15, 2015). These provisions state:\n\n            \u201cNo person having his residence or place of business within the territorial\n        limits of the city shall be permitted to dispose of sewage of such residence or\n        place of business located in the city otherwise than through the sewer mains of\n        the city whenever the sewer mains of the sewerage system of the city are\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f        adjacent to his property, without the written permission of the council.\u201d Rock\n        Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-186 (adopted July 7, 2015).\n\n             \u201cThe owner of each house, building or property used for human occupancy,\n        employment, recreation or any other purpose, situated within the city is\n        required, at his expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein, meeting the\n        requirements of the state *** plumbing code, and to connect such facilities\n        directly with the public wastewater treatment system in accordance with the\n        provisions of this division, and within 60 days after official notice to so connect.\n        This provision shall be effective provided that there [is] a wastewater treatment\n        system main located: (i) within 300 feet of the property line of a property\n        utilized for residential purposes; (ii) within 300 feet of the property line of a\n        property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow of\n        less than 1,500 gallons per day; or, (iii) within 1,000 feet of the property line of\n        a property utilized for nonresidential purposes which has a daily sewage flow\n        of 1,500 gallons per day or greater.\u201d Rock Falls Municipal Code, \u00a7 32-190 (eff.\n        Sept. 15, 2015).\n\n\u00b66        In addition, section 1-41(n) of the Code authorizes the City to seek injunctive\n     relief for continuous violations of the Code:\n\n        \u201cViolations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public\n        nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The\n        imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief.\u201d Rock Falls\n        Municipal Code, \u00a7 1-41(n) (eff. July 5, 2017).\n\n\u00b67       Following its purchase of the property, Aims was notified by the City that it\n     was required to connect to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system pursuant to\n     section 32-189(g) of the Code. However, Aims did not do so.\n\n\u00b68       Thereafter, on August 5, 2019, the City filed a verified petition for injunctive\n     and other relief to compel Aims\u2019s compliance with the sewage disposal provisions\n     of the Code. The petition sought the imposition of a fine as well as a mandatory\n     injunction requiring Aims to abandon its private sewage disposal system and\n     connect to the public sewage disposal system by a date certain to be determined by\n     the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f\u00b69         The case proceeded to a bench trial. Nathan Simonton, an estimator from a civil\n       engineering firm, testified regarding the construction work that would be required\n       to connect the property to the public sewage disposal system as well as the\n       estimated cost for such work. He stated that it would cost approximately $150,000\n       to connect the property to the public sewer using a gravity system of waste disposal.\n       This included the cost of installing lateral connectors\u2014sewage lines that run from\n       a property to the main sewer line. He also stated that an alternative method of\n       connection involving the use of an electric pump would cost approximately\n       $51,000.\n\n\u00b6 10       Robin Blackert, the City\u2019s administrator, testified that in 2020 the City\n       approved an ordinance pursuant to section 32-186 of the Code that excused another\n       business located within the City from the requirement of connecting to the public\n       sewage system. According to Blackert, the City passed the ordinance because\n       connecting to the public sewage disposal system would have been cost prohibitive\n       and an undue hardship on the business. Aims had sought a similar exclusion from\n       the City prior to trial but was denied.\n\n\u00b6 11       At the conclusion of trial, the trial court noted that, while the City had requested\n       the imposition of a fine in its petition, that request had effectively been abandoned\n       during the proceedings and the only question before the court was whether\n       injunctive relief was appropriate. On that issue, the trial court found that section\n       32-189(g) of the Code had been triggered by Aims\u2019s purchase of the property in\n       2017 and that Aims had not connected to the City\u2019s public sewage disposal system.\n       The court further found that the City had met its burden of establishing that a public\n       sewer with a daily sewage flow of less than 1500 gallons per day was located within\n       300 feet of the property, as required for the sewer to be considered \u201cavailable\u201d for\n       connection within the meaning of section 32-189(g), and that Aims had not been\n       granted the City council\u2019s written permission to continue the use of its private\n       sewage disposal. Nevertheless, the court denied the City\u2019s petition.\n\n\u00b6 12       Emphasizing that it was \u201csitting as a court in equity,\u201d the trial court determined\n       that it was required to balance the equities between the parties when ruling on the\n       City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The court noted that no evidence had been\n       produced to show that Aims\u2019s private sewage system was failing or that it presented\n       a threat to public health. The court also noted that connecting to the public sewage\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f       disposal system would be expensive, imposing a hardship on Aims, and that the\n       City had granted an exception to another commercial property owner in the past. In\n       addition, although the trial court found it \u201creasonable\u201d for the City to require\n       property owners to connect to the public sewage system, the court stated it had \u201ca\n       hard time understanding\u201d why the sale or transfer of a property triggered that\n       requirement. The court concluded: \u201cHaving done what can be called the balancing\n       in equity, because that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about, the fairness to everybody,\n       the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief is denied.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 13       The City appealed, arguing that the trial court had no authority to balance the\n       equities when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The\n       appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App\n       (4th) 220208-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\u00b6 14       Before addressing the availability of injunctive relief, the appellate court noted\n       that language in the trial court\u2019s order indicated that it had both incorporated a\n       comparative cost analysis and had considered the absence of lateral connectors\n       when determining whether a connection to the public sewage disposal system was\n       \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of the Code. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21-32. The appellate court\n       concluded that this was error and that the availability of a connection was defined\n       solely under the terms of sections 32-186 and 32-190 of the Code. Id. \u00b6 32. The\n       appellate court further held that the requirements of both these provisions had been\n       established by the City. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n\u00b6 15        The appellate court then addressed \u201cwhether it was appropriate for the trial\n       court to balance the hardships when deciding whether to grant the City\u2019s request\n       for injunctive relief.\u201d Id. \u00b6 42. The appellate court acknowledged that, when a suit\n       is brought in equity seeking injunctive relief, the general rule is that the trial court\n       must balance the equities between the parties. Id. \u00b6 44. The court stated, however,\n       that \u201cwhere a governmental agency is expressly authorized by statute to seek\n       injunctive relief, the traditional equitable elements necessary to obtain an injunction\n       need not be satisfied.\u201d Id. \u00b6 45.

The City, in response, contends that the\n       appellate court correctly determined that the trial court lacked any such authority.\n\n\u00b6 19       The City does not dispute that, when a suit is filed in equity seeking mandatory\n       injunctive relief, the moving party must establish that it has no adequate remedy at\n       law, that it possesses a certain and clearly ascertainable right, and that it will suffer\n       irreparable harm if no relief is granted.

The City points out, however, in this case the City did not file a suit in\n       equity but at law, and its petition sought an injunction pursuant to the Code rather\n       than the trial court\u2019s inherent equitable authority.

This principle of law is animated by the rationale that\n          because statutes authorizing injunctive relief often do so on behalf of a public\n          official in his or her capacity as the enforcer of a regulatory scheme, \u2018the\n          violation of such a statute implies an injury to the general public [and] [s]uch\n          injury necessitates the statutory authorization for equitable relief and supplants\n          the traditional equitable pleading requirements.\u2019 Sadat, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022569\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022569/sadat-v-american-motors-corp/\">104 Ill. 2d at 113</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

In the latter situation, the equities have, in effect, already been balanced\n       by the legislative body, and that balance is reflected in the policy choices contained\n       within the statute. A court is not free to disregard or \u201crebalance\u201d the policy\n       determinations made by a legislative body. See, e.g., Roselle Police Pension Board\n       v.

We\n       disagree. It is well settled that \u201c[a] municipal ordinance has the force of law over\n       the community in which it is adopted and, within the corporate limits, operates as\n       effectively as a law passed by the legislature.\u201d City of Chicago v.

Like a statute, the sewage ordinances at issue in this case were\n       enacted by a legislative body and have the full force of law.

However, the appellate\n       court read Cryns as holding that a law authorizing injunctive relief only relieves the\n       governmental body of proving the \u201cthree traditional elements\u201d for an injunction,\n       i.e., a lack of an adequate remedy at law, a certain and clearly ascertainable right,\n       and irreparable harm if no relief is granted. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123947/county-of-kendall-v-rosenwinkel/\">Id. at 539-40</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus, according to\n       Rosenwinkel, even in those situations where a law authorizes a governmental body\n       to seek a mandatory injunction and a violation of that law has been proven, the trial\n       court must still balance the equities before granting injunctive relief. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123947/county-of-kendall-v-rosenwinkel/\">Id. at 539</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Further, Rosenwinkel\u2019s conclusion that a trial court must balance the equities,\n       even if a law expressly providing for injunctive relief has been violated, cannot\n       stand. Such a rule would effectively permit a trial court to second-guess the\n       legislative body as to whether a particular regulatory scheme was equitable or\n       otherwise in the best interests of the public, even though such decisions fall\n       squarely within the realm of legislative determinations.

BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       This appeal takes place in the context of a dissolution proceeding that has\n     remained ongoing for well over a decade. In 2009, petitioner, Masud M. Arjmand,\n     filed a petition to dissolve his marriage to respondent, Muneeza R. Arjmand. The\n     same year, the circuit court entered a judgment for dissolution of marriage that\n     incorporated the parties\u2019 marital settlement agreement. However, in 2011\n     respondent filed a petition to vacate the dissolution judgment pursuant to section 2-\n     1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILC 5/2-1401 (West 2010)), alleging that\n     the judgment was unconscionable because the marital settlement agreement was\n     secured by coercion and fraudulent concealment of income and assets. The circuit\n     court, via Judge Timothy J. McJoynt, granted the petition in 2012, leaving in place\n     only the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling and sought to stay the proceedings\n     in the circuit court while the appeal was pending. In February 2013, the circuit court\n     granted petitioner\u2019s motion and, \u201cas a condition of bond,\u201d restricted the parties\u2019\n     ability to encumber or dispose of certain investment assets that they owned before\n     the entry of the initial dissolution judgment, including stocks and funds held in\n     brokerage accounts.\n\n\u00b65      The appellate court entered an order in October 2013 affirming the circuit\n     court\u2019s grant of respondent\u2019s section 2-1401 petition. In re Marriage of Arjmand,\n     2013 IL App (2d) 120639.\n\n\u00b66       In July 2014, respondent\u2019s attorney, Bryan Estes of the Stogsdill Law Firm\n     (collectively, the Stogsdill defendants) sent a letter to Morgan Stanley Smith\n     Barney, LLC (Morgan Stanley), enclosing a copy of the February 2013 order and\n     requesting compliance with the order. Morgan Stanley then restricted petitioner\u2019s\n     access to the assets that he held with the company.\n\n\u00b67       In April 2015, Morgan Stanley sought to intervene in the dissolution case to\n     clarify the February 2013 order with respect to petitioner\u2019s accounts, as the parties\n     had made conflicting demands regarding the accounts. The circuit court tabled the\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       request pending resolution of several appeals by petitioner related to the February\n       2013 order.\n\n\u00b68         In August 2015, petitioner filed a complaint in the Cook County circuit court\n       against Morgan Stanley and several affiliated entities (collectively, the Morgan\n       Stanley defendants) and the Stogsdill defendants, alleging various causes of action\n       stemming from the restriction of petitioner\u2019s access to his assets. Petitioner alleged\n       significant damages resulting from, among other things, being unable to pay\n       substantial business and personal obligations. The action was transferred to the\n       Du Page County circuit court, where it was dismissed with prejudice by Judge\n       Ronald Sutter in August 2016 as an improper collateral attack on an order entered\n       in the dissolution proceeding.\n\n\u00b69         In December 2017, Judge McJoynt found that Accenture Founders Shares stock\n       that petitioner held with Morgan Stanley was his nonmarital asset but that the\n       injunctive portions of the February 2013 order remained in full force and effect as\n       to petitioner and respondent only.\n\n\u00b6 10       Petitioner filed a petition under section 2-1401 in August 2018 seeking to\n       partially vacate the August 2016 order. Judge Sutter denied the petition, and the\n       appellate court affirmed the ruling. Arjmand v. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC,\n       2019 IL App (2d) 180785-U.\n\n\u00b6 11      On December 23, 2019, petitioner filed a new complaint, within the dissolution\n       proceeding, against the Morgan Stanley and Stogsdill defendants (collectively\n       defendants), raising largely the same claims.\n\n\u00b6 12      Days later, on December 27, 2019, petitioner filed a \u201cThird Petition for\n       Substitution of Judge [f]or Cause and for Assignment to a Judge in a Different\n       Appellate District,\u201d pursuant to section 2-1001(a)(3)(ii) (735 ILCS 5/2-\n       1001(a)(3)(ii) (West 2018)) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 1 The petition\n       contained many allegations regarding the restriction of petitioner\u2019s Morgan Stanley\n       account. Petitioner filed an amended petition for substitution the following month.\n       Judge McJoynt ruled that there could be cause if petitioner\u2019s allegations were\n       accepted as true, such that he would have another judge rule on the petition. Judge\n\n           1\n            Petitioner filed his first petition for substitution of judge for cause in February 2014 and his\n       second petition for substitution of judge for cause in December 2014. Both petitions were denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      -3-\n\f       Robert Kleeman denied the petition on June 3, 2020, and he later denied petitioner\u2019s\n       motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 13       Petitioner then filed, on July 6, 2020, a \u201cMotion for Substitution of Judge as of\n       Right or Alternatively for Recusal as to [Morgan Stanley] Complaint.\u201d See id. \u00a7 2-\n       1001(a)(2)(ii). Judge McJoynt denied the motion on August 6, 2020, on the basis\n       that he had already made hundreds of substantive rulings in the dissolution case and\n       there was no evidence of interest, bias, or prejudice. He subsequently denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 14       On November 19, 2020, Judge McJoynt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\n       the complaint against them with prejudice, based on res judicata from Judge\n       Sutter\u2019s ruling. He also granted the Morgan Stanley defendants\u2019 request to dismiss\n       two counts with prejudice for failing to state a claim against those defendants.\n       Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which Judge McJoynt denied on April 28,\n       2021. The order contained findings under Rule 304(a) that there was no just reason\n       for delaying enforcement or appeal of the denial of the motion to reconsider and\n       the November 19, 2020, dismissal order, nunc pro tunc. Petitioner filed a timely\n       notice of appeal, citing the April 2021 order and \u201call orders in [the] procedural\n       progression leading to it.\u201d He stated that he sought reversal of the April 2021 order\n       and the November 2020 dismissal order.\n\n\u00b6 15       In a summary order, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in\n       dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint as barred by res judicata, because Judge Sutter\u2019s\n       2016 dismissal was not based on the merits of the claims. No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 10\n       (2022) (unpublished summary order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23(c)). It\n       remanded the case for the circuit court to consider whether the dismissal was proper\n       on any other grounds. Id. \u00b6 11. This portion of the judgment is not at issue here.\n\n\u00b6 16       Petitioner also challenged the denials of his petition and motion for substitution\n       of judge. The appellate court stated that there was no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       allowing for an interlocutory appeal from the denials of the substitution requests.\n       Id. \u00b6 12. Therefore, they could be reviewed only on appeal from a final order. Id.\n       Petitioner relied on Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d\n       184, 186-87 (1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 179 Ill. 2d 1 (1997), where the\n       Appellate Court, Fourth District, held that it could review a decision on a motion\n       for substitution of judge in conjunction with an interlocutory appeal under Illinois\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f       Supreme Court Rule 307 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). The appellate court here stated that\n       Berlin was from another appellate district and therefore not binding on the court.\n       No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 13. The appellate court instead relied on the Second District case\n       In re Marriage of Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d 961, 970-71 (2004), which disagreed\n       with Berlin on the basis that Illinois Supreme Court rules do not allow review of\n       such orders in interlocutory appeals. No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 13. The appellate court\n       therefore concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the rulings on the petition and\n       motion for substitution of judge. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 17       We granted petitioner leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n       We allowed the Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers\n       to file an amicus curiae brief in support of petitioner\u2019s position. See Ill. S. Ct. R.\n       345 (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 18                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 19       The Illinois Constitution grants the appellate court jurisdiction to hear appeals\n       from final judgments of the circuit courts. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. The\n       constitution further allows this court to \u201cprovide by rule for appeals to the Appellate\n       Court from other than final judgments of Circuit Courts.\u201d Id. Therefore, the\n       appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review judgments, orders, or decrees that are\n       not final, unless an Illinois Supreme Court rule provides for jurisdiction. Johnson\n       v. Armstrong, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 20       In this case, petitioner appealed pursuant to Rule 304(a), which states in\n       relevant part:\n\n          \u201cIf multiple parties or multiple claims for relief are involved in an action, an\n          appeal may be taken from a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all\n          of the parties or claims only if the trial court has made an express written finding\n          that there is no just reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both.\n          *** In the absence of such a finding, any judgment that adjudicates fewer than\n          all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties is not\n          enforceable or appealable and is subject to revision at any time before the entry\n          of a judgment adjudicating all the claims, rights, and liabilities of all the\n          parties.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       The construction of Illinois Supreme Court rules is a question of law subject to\n       de novo review. People v. English, 2023 IL 128077, \u00b6 13. We interpret our rules in\n       the same manner as statutes, with the primary concern being to give effect to our\n       intent, most commonly shown through the rule\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. Id.\n       Likewise, we review de novo the issue of whether a court has jurisdiction. In re\n       Marriage of Crecos, 2021 IL 126192, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b6 21        Rule 304(a) supplanted former section 50(2) of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev.\n       Stat. 1957, ch. 110, \u00b6 50(2)). In re Marriage of Lentz, 79 Ill. 2d 400, 407 (1980).\n       We have described section 50(2) as \u201cnot one which either curtails or grants\n       appellate jurisdiction, but *** one which fixes the procedure in the trial court as to\n       the conditions affecting the terms upon which an appeal may be taken in advance\n       of a determination of the entire case.\u201d Ariola v. Nigro, 13 Ill. 2d 200, 207 (1958).\n       Prior to section 50(2), a wider scope of judgments was immediately appealable. See\n       Barnhart v. Barnhart, 415 Ill. 303, 309 (1953) (\u201cA decree is final [and appealable]\n       if it determines the ultimate rights of the parties with respect to distinct matters\n       which have no bearing on other matters left for further consideration or if the\n       matters left for future determination are merely incidental to the ultimate rights\n       which have been adjudicated by the decree.\u201d). A judgment was traditionally defined\n       as the court\u2019s determination on the issues presented by the pleadings, which\n       ascertained and fixed absolutely and finally the rights of the parties to the lawsuit.\n       Towns v. Yellow Cab Co., 73 Ill. 2d 113, 119 (1978). \u201cBecause judgments are final\n       in nature, the rule developed that judgments as to fewer than all parties or claims\n       were not only appealable, but had to be appealed if the rights of the party against\n       whom the judgment had been entered were to be preserved.\u201d Id. This led to\n       \u201cundesirable fragmentary appeals.\u201d Id. The legislature therefore enacted section\n       50(2) to discourage piecemeal appeals and to remove uncertainty about\n       appealability when a final judgment was entered on fewer than all matters of\n       controversy. Carter v. Chicago & Illinois Midland Ry. Co., 119 Ill. 2d 296 (1988);\n       Ariola, 13 Ill. 2d at 207.\n\n\u00b6 22       As stated, Rule 304(a) has since replaced section 50(2). To be considered final\n       for Rule 304(a) purposes, the order must dispose of the rights of the parties, either\n       upon the entire controversy or upon some definite and separate part thereof.\n       Johnson, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 21. \u201c[I]t is not the court\u2019s finding that makes the\n       judgment final, but it is the court\u2019s finding that makes this kind of a final judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       appealable.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a), Committee Comments (rev. Sept. 1988); see also\n       Johnson, 2022 IL 127942, \u00b6 20 (Rule 304(a) language cannot confer appellate\n       jurisdiction for a nonfinal order). Like section 50(2), the policy considerations\n       underlying Rule 304(a) include \u201c \u2018discouraging piecemeal appeals in the absence\n       of some compelling reason and *** removing the uncertainty as to the appealability\n       of a judgment which was entered on less than all of the matters in controversy.\u2019 \u201d\n       The Carle Foundation v. Cunningham Township, 2017 IL 120427, \u00b6 15 (quoting\n       In re Marriage of Lentz, 79 Ill. 2d at 407). In other words, \u201ca Rule 304(a) appeal is\n       an exception to the general policy disfavoring piecemeal appeals.\u201d Elg v.\n       Whittington, 119 Ill. 2d 344, 354 (1987).\n\n\u00b6 23       We note that in the instant case the circuit court entered a Rule 304(a) finding\n       on the portion of the litigation that dismissed petitioner\u2019s separate claims as to\n       defendants, giving the appellate court jurisdiction to review that order. The\n       substitution of judge rulings would not have been subject to their own Rule 304(a)\n       findings for appeal because they were not \u201cfinal\u201d in that they did not dispose of the\n       parties\u2019 rights as to a separate part of the controversy. See Johnson, 2022 IL\n       127942, \u00b6 21; People ex rel. Scott v. Silverstein, 87 Ill. 2d 167, 171 (1981)\n       (\u201cPreliminary orders in a pending case are not appealable because they are\n       reviewable on appeal from the final order.\u201d). The question here is whether the\n       appellate court has jurisdiction over such a ruling in an appeal of the subsequent\n       order under Rule 304(a).\n\n\u00b6 24        The appellate court has issued conflicting opinions regarding whether it has\n       jurisdiction over rulings on requests for substitution of judge in conjunction with\n       an appealable interlocutory order. Petitioner relies primarily on Berlin, 268 Ill. App.\n       3d at 186-87. There, the Fourth District held that, in an interlocutory appeal of a\n       grant of a preliminary injunction under Rule 307(a)(1), it had jurisdiction over a\n       ruling on a motion for substitution of judge as a matter of right. Id. The appellate\n       court stated that the \u201cscope of the review under Rule 307 is to review any prior\n       error that bears directly upon the question of whether the order on appeal was\n       proper,\u201d which included \u201cwhether the judge hearing the request for interlocutory\n       injunctive relief should have been sitting in that matter.\u201d Id. at 187. According to\n       the court, a contrary holding would allow \u201ca judge who should not be hearing a\n       motion for interlocutory injunctive relief to hear that matter without the objecting\n       party having any recourse.\u201d Id. at 186-87. The Appellate Court, First District, has\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       followed Berlin. See Bank of America, N.A. v. Freed, 2012 IL App (1st) 110749,\n       \u00b6\u00b6 14-16 (the defendants forfeited the issue of whether the circuit court erred in\n       refusing to grant their motion for substitution of judge as a matter of right because\n       they did not raise the issue in their prior interlocutory appeal); Partipilo v. Partipilo,\n       331 Ill. App. 3d 394, 398 (1st Dist. 2002) (citing Berlin without additional\n       analysis); see also In re A.N., 324 Ill. App. 3d 510, 512 (4th Dist. 2001) (applying\n       Berlin\u2019s rationale to the State\u2019s appeal under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1)\n       (eff. Nov. 1, 2000)).\n\n\u00b6 25       Respondent and the Morgan Stanley defendants cite In re Marriage of\n       Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d 961, in which the Appellate Court, Second District,\n       reached a different result. In that case, the husband appealed under Illinois Supreme\n       Court Rule 304(b)(5) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994) from an order of indirect civil contempt,\n       and he also sought review of his motions for substitution of judge. In re Marriage\n       of Nettleton, 348 Ill. App. 3d at 962. The court stated that, pursuant to Rule\n       304(b)(5)\u2019s plain meaning, the only order subject to review was the circuit court\u2019s\n       finding of contempt, which necessarily required a review of the temporary\n       maintenance with which the husband had refused to comply. Id. at 968. In contrast,\n       the rulings on the motions for substitution were interlocutory and reviewable only\n       on appeal from the final order. Id. at 969.\n\n\u00b6 26       The In re Marriage of Nettleton court stated that Berlin was distinguishable\n       because there the court reviewed uncontroverted facts to determine whether the\n       motion for substitution was timely filed before a substantive issue had been ruled\n       upon, whereas in the case before it, the facts were controverted. Id. at 970. Even\n       otherwise, it \u201cbelieved[d] that the supreme court rule should prevail over the ruling\n       of Berlin, such that [it was] precluded from reviewing the merits of the rulings on\n       the motions.\u201d Id. The court stated that a contrary interpretation would allow a party\n       to circumvent supreme court rules by obtaining an appeal by refusing to comply\n       with an order and being found in contempt, at which time the party could appeal\n       the contempt order as a means to \u201cchallenge all other orders with which the party\n       is dissatisfied.\u201d Id. at 971. The Appellate Court, Third District, has followed In re\n       Marriage of Nettleton. See In re Marriage of Morgan, 2019 IL App (3d) 180560,\n       \u00b6 14; see also U.S. Bank National Ass\u2019n v. IN Retail Fund Algonquin Commons,\n       LLC, 2013 IL App (2d) 130213 (concluding that in an appeal under Rule 307(a)(1)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       the court lacked jurisdiction over an order granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for\n       substitution of judge as a matter of right).\n\n\u00b6 27        Petitioner additionally cites In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien, 2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 23,\n       and Burtell v. First Charter Service Corp., 76 Ill. 2d 427, 435 (1979), for the\n       proposition that appellate review includes not only the order specifically appealed\n       but also all orders in the procedural progression of that order. In re Marriage of\n       O\u2019Brien was before this court on an application for a certificate of importance under\n       Illinois Supreme Court Rule 316 (eff. Dec. 6, 2006), after a judgment of dissolution\n       had been entered. The wife argued that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction over\n       an order denying substitution for cause, because the husband\u2019s notice of appeal did\n       not specify that he was appealing that particular order. In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien,\n       2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 21. We stated that notices of appeal are to be liberally construed\n       and that they \u201cconfer jurisdiction even if the order was not expressly mentioned in\n       the notice of appeal, if that order was \u2018a \u201cstep in the procedural progression\n       leading\u201d \u2019 to the judgment which was specified in the notice of appeal.\u201d Id. \u00b6 23\n       (quoting Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 435, quoting Elfman Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp.,\n       567 F.2d 1252, 1254 (3d Cir. 1977)). We stated that, because the denial of the\n       husband\u2019s petition to substitute was a step in the procedural progression leading to\n       the final judgment specified in his notice of appeal, the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction to review the order. Id.\n\n\u00b6 28       The issue in Burtell was also the construction of a notice of appeal on review\n       from the final judgment of the case. The notice of appeal listed the final money\n       judgment, but not a prior order in which the circuit court found that a joint venture\n       existed and ordered an accounting. Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 431-32. We stated:\n\n          \u201cWhen an appeal is taken from a specified judgment only, or from a part of a\n          specified judgment, the court of review acquires no jurisdiction to review other\n          judgments or parts thereof not so specified or not fairly to be inferred from the\n          notice as intended to be presented for review on the appeal. If from the notice\n          of appeal itself and the subsequent proceedings it appears that the appeal was\n          intended, and the appellant and the appellee so understood, to have been taken\n          from an unspecified judgment or part thereof, the notice of appeal may be\n          construed as bringing up for review the unspecified part of the order or\n          judgment. Such a construction would be appropriate where the specified order\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f          directly relates back to the judgment or order sought to be reviewed.\n          Paraphrasing the language of Elfman, the unspecified judgment is reviewable if\n          it is a \u2018step in the procedural progression leading\u2019 to the judgment specified in\n          the notice of appeal.\u201d Id. at 434 (quoting Elfman Motors, 567 F.2d at 1254).\n\n       We stated that the order finding the existence of a joint venture was a preliminary\n       determination necessary to the ultimate relief that plaintiff sought, namely a money\n       judgment based on an accounting. Thus, \u201cit was sufficiently closely related\u201d to the\n       money judgment specified in the notice of appeal that the appellate court had\n       jurisdiction to consider the order. Id. at 436.\n\n\u00b6 29        We conclude that the appellate court here was correct in its determination that\n       Rule 304(a) did not confer jurisdiction to review the rulings on the petition and\n       motion for substitution of judge. In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien and Burtell are\n       distinguishable from this situation because they involved the construction of a\n       notice of appeal in an appeal from the final judgment in the case. Interlocutory\n       orders that are not immediately appealable are subject to review upon appeal from\n       the final judgment in the case. See id. at 433 (the appeal from a final judgment\n       \u201c \u2018draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the\n       judgment\u2019 \u201d (quoting Elfman Motors, 567 F.2d at 1253)). Therefore, the\n       substitution of judge order in In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien was appealable when the\n       final judgment in the case was entered. Typically, a \u201cnotice of appeal confers\n       jurisdiction on a court of review to consider only the judgments or parts of\n       judgments specified in the notice of appeal\u201d (General Motors Corp. v. Pappas, 242\n       Ill. 2d 163, 176 (2011)), but although the substitution of judge order was not listed\n       in the In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien notice of appeal, we liberally construed the notice\n       of appeal to include that order as \u201c \u2018a \u201cstep in the procedural progression leading\u201d \u2019\n       to the judgment which was specified in the notice of appeal\u201d (In re Marriage of\n       O\u2019Brien, 2011 IL 109039, \u00b6 23 (quoting Burtell, 76 Ill. 2d at 435, quoting Elfman\n       Motors, 567 F.2d at 1254)). Again, there was no question that the substitution of\n       judge ruling was appealable at that time because a final judgment had been entered\n       in the case, and the controversy was only in construing the notice of appeal to\n       determine whether the appellant sufficiently invoked review of the order.\n\n\u00b6 30      Here, the dispute is focused not on the scope of the notice of appeal but rather\n       on the broader question of whether Rule 304(a) could give the appellate court\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f       jurisdiction to review the substitution of judge rulings. Rule 304(a) applies\n       exclusively to final orders. Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). In an\n       interlocutory appeal under Rule 304(a), the circuit court has determined that, in\n       spite of the court\u2019s general policy disfavoring fragmented appeals, \u201cthere is no just\n       reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both\u201d of a particular \u201cfinal\n       judgment.\u201d Id. In this manner, a Rule 304(a) appeal is limited in scope and does not\n       pave the way for review of all prior orders. See also Trent v. Winningham, 172 Ill.\n       2d 420, 424 (1996) (the intended scope of review under Rule 304(a) is tailored to\n       particular issues). The circuit court in the instant case entered Rule 304(a) findings\n       on the order dismissing petitioner\u2019s complaint against the Stogsdill and Morgan\n       Stanley defendants and the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider, such that the\n       extent of the appellate court\u2019s review was restricted to determining whether the\n       dismissal was in error. Cf. Postma v. Jack Brown Buick Inc., 157 Ill. 2d 391, 399\n       (1993) (in an appeal under Rule 307(a)(1), the only question properly before the\n       court is whether there was a sufficient showing made in the circuit court to sustain\n       its order granting or denying interlocutory relief); People v. Ernest, 141 Ill. 2d 412,\n       424 (1990) (stating, in an attorney\u2019s appeal from a finding of direct criminal\n       contempt, that the propriety of an order denying a motion for substitution of judge\n       was not before the court and that a \u201ccourt order made within the proper exercise of\n       jurisdiction, no matter how erroneous, must be obeyed until the order is modified\n       or set aside by the trial court or reversed on appeal\u201d). Accordingly, even if petitioner\n       had expressly listed the substitution of judge rulings in his notice of appeal along\n       with the orders specified in the Rule 304(a) findings, Rule 304(a) would not give\n       the appellate court jurisdiction to review the rulings on the substitution requests.\n\n\u00b6 31       One could argue that review of certain orders appealed under Rule 304(a) could\n       require review of prior rulings in order to address the merits of the particular order\n       appealed. See IN Retail Fund Algonquin Commons, LLC, 2013 IL App (2d)\n       130213, \u00b6 22 (\u201c[R]eview of an interlocutory order may well require review of\n       \u2018attendant\u2019 prior orders, i.e., those intertwined with the merits of the interlocutory\n       order.\u201d). Rulings on petitions and motions for substitution of judge do not fall into\n       this category, as they are independent of the substantive merits of the order at issue\n       in a Rule 304(a) appeal. Whether a substitution request should have been granted\n       is not intertwined with the merits of the final judgment subject to Rule 304(a)\n       review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f\u00b6 32       It is true, as petitioner highlights, that all orders entered after an erroneous\n       denial of substitution are a nullity and must be vacated. Palos Community Hospital\n       v. Humana Insurance Co., 2021 IL 126008, \u00b6 34. Petitioner argues that, by\n       considering the denial of a petition for substitution of judge during an interlocutory\n       appeal, we would be promoting the efficient use of judicial and party resources\n       during the proceedings. Respondent counters that, if we allow jurisdiction, it could\n       open the floodgates to appellate challenges by parties who seek to upend the\n       progress of their cases, as they could file pretextual requests for injunctions and\n       then obtain appeals to also challenge the rulings on the substitution motions.\n\n\u00b6 33       We note that this marriage dissolution case has been litigated for more than 10\n       years even without a reversal of a substitution of judge ruling, which suggests that\n       considerations of judicial economy and the preservation of party resources have not\n       been top of mind. More significantly, \u201c[p]rinciples of judicial economy may not\n       trump the jurisdictional barrier erected by\u201d an Illinois Supreme Court rule. People\n       v. Johnson, 208 Ill. 2d 118, 141 (2003)). There is no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       that independently allows for an appeal from an interlocutory order resolving a\n       petition or motion for substitution of judge. Rule 304(a) provides for review of just\n       the intermediate final judgment that the circuit court has allowed the party to appeal\n       from, along with any previous orders that must necessarily be reviewed because\n       they are intertwined with the merits of the judgment with the Rule 304(a) finding;\n       Rule 304(a) does not provide jurisdiction to review rulings on requests for\n       substitution of judge. 2\n\n\n\u00b6 34                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 35       For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court dismissing\n       the portion of petitioner\u2019s appeal pertaining to the rulings on his petition and motion\n       for substitution of judge.\n\n\n\n\n           2\n             As the issue before us pertains to an appeal under Rule 304(a), we do not resolve whether\n       rulings on requests for substitution of judge could be reviewed in conjunction with other types of\n       interlocutory appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 36   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                   - 13 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 129155</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 129155)\n\n      In re MARRIAGE OF MASUD M.

Mar. 8, 2016), the appellate court had jurisdiction\n     to consider prior orders denying appellant\u2019s petition and motion for substitution of\n     judge. For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment\n\f     concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the petition and motion.\n\n\n\u00b62                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       This appeal takes place in the context of a dissolution proceeding that has\n     remained ongoing for well over a decade. In 2009, petitioner, Masud M. Arjmand,\n     filed a petition to dissolve his marriage to respondent, Muneeza R. Arjmand. The\n     same year, the circuit court entered a judgment for dissolution of marriage that\n     incorporated the parties\u2019 marital settlement agreement. However, in 2011\n     respondent filed a petition to vacate the dissolution judgment pursuant to section 2-\n     1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILC 5/2-1401 (West 2010)), alleging that\n     the judgment was unconscionable because the marital settlement agreement was\n     secured by coercion and fraudulent concealment of income and assets. The circuit\n     court, via Judge Timothy J. McJoynt, granted the petition in 2012, leaving in place\n     only the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling and sought to stay the proceedings\n     in the circuit court while the appeal was pending. In February 2013, the circuit court\n     granted petitioner\u2019s motion and, \u201cas a condition of bond,\u201d restricted the parties\u2019\n     ability to encumber or dispose of certain investment assets that they owned before\n     the entry of the initial dissolution judgment, including stocks and funds held in\n     brokerage accounts.\n\n\u00b65      The appellate court entered an order in October 2013 affirming the circuit\n     court\u2019s grant of respondent\u2019s section 2-1401 petition.

Morgan Stanley then restricted petitioner\u2019s\n     access to the assets that he held with the company.\n\n\u00b67       In April 2015, Morgan Stanley sought to intervene in the dissolution case to\n     clarify the February 2013 order with respect to petitioner\u2019s accounts, as the parties\n     had made conflicting demands regarding the accounts. The circuit court tabled the\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       request pending resolution of several appeals by petitioner related to the February\n       2013 order.\n\n\u00b68         In August 2015, petitioner filed a complaint in the Cook County circuit court\n       against Morgan Stanley and several affiliated entities (collectively, the Morgan\n       Stanley defendants) and the Stogsdill defendants, alleging various causes of action\n       stemming from the restriction of petitioner\u2019s access to his assets. Petitioner alleged\n       significant damages resulting from, among other things, being unable to pay\n       substantial business and personal obligations. The action was transferred to the\n       Du Page County circuit court, where it was dismissed with prejudice by Judge\n       Ronald Sutter in August 2016 as an improper collateral attack on an order entered\n       in the dissolution proceeding.\n\n\u00b69         In December 2017, Judge McJoynt found that Accenture Founders Shares stock\n       that petitioner held with Morgan Stanley was his nonmarital asset but that the\n       injunctive portions of the February 2013 order remained in full force and effect as\n       to petitioner and respondent only.\n\n\u00b6 10       Petitioner filed a petition under section 2-1401 in August 2018 seeking to\n       partially vacate the August 2016 order. Judge Sutter denied the petition, and the\n       appellate court affirmed the ruling. Arjmand v.

Petitioner filed an amended petition for substitution the following month.\n       Judge McJoynt ruled that there could be cause if petitioner\u2019s allegations were\n       accepted as true, such that he would have another judge rule on the petition. Judge\n\n           1\n            Petitioner filed his first petition for substitution of judge for cause in February 2014 and his\n       second petition for substitution of judge for cause in December 2014. Both petitions were denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      -3-\n\f       Robert Kleeman denied the petition on June 3, 2020, and he later denied petitioner\u2019s\n       motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 13       Petitioner then filed, on July 6, 2020, a \u201cMotion for Substitution of Judge as of\n       Right or Alternatively for Recusal as to [Morgan Stanley] Complaint.\u201d See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> \u00a7 2-\n       1001(a)(2)(ii). Judge McJoynt denied the motion on August 6, 2020, on the basis\n       that he had already made hundreds of substantive rulings in the dissolution case and\n       there was no evidence of interest, bias, or prejudice. He subsequently denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider.\n\n\u00b6 14       On November 19, 2020, Judge McJoynt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\n       the complaint against them with prejudice, based on res judicata from Judge\n       Sutter\u2019s ruling. He also granted the Morgan Stanley defendants\u2019 request to dismiss\n       two counts with prejudice for failing to state a claim against those defendants.\n       Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which Judge McJoynt denied on April 28,\n       2021. The order contained findings under Rule 304(a) that there was no just reason\n       for delaying enforcement or appeal of the denial of the motion to reconsider and\n       the November 19, 2020, dismissal order, nunc pro tunc. Petitioner filed a timely\n       notice of appeal, citing the April 2021 order and \u201call orders in [the] procedural\n       progression leading to it.\u201d He stated that he sought reversal of the April 2021 order\n       and the November 2020 dismissal order.\n\n\u00b6 15       In a summary order, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in\n       dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint as barred by res judicata, because Judge Sutter\u2019s\n       2016 dismissal was not based on the merits of the claims. No. 2-21-0285, \u00b6 10\n       (2022) (unpublished summary order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23(c)). It\n       remanded the case for the circuit court to consider whether the dismissal was proper\n       on any other grounds. Id. \u00b6 11. This portion of the judgment is not at issue here.\n\n\u00b6 16       Petitioner also challenged the denials of his petition and motion for substitution\n       of judge. The appellate court stated that there was no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       allowing for an interlocutory appeal from the denials of the substitution requests.\n       Id. \u00b6 12. Therefore, they could be reviewed only on appeal from a final order. Id.\n       Petitioner relied on Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">268 Ill.

ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 19       The Illinois Constitution grants the appellate court jurisdiction to hear appeals\n       from final judgments of the circuit courts. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. The\n       constitution further allows this court to \u201cprovide by rule for appeals to the Appellate\n       Court from other than final judgments of Circuit Courts.\u201d Id.

Therefore, the\n       substitution of judge order in In re Marriage of O\u2019Brien was appealable when the\n       final judgment in the case was entered.

Again, there was no question that the substitution of\n       judge ruling was appealable at that time because a final judgment had been entered\n       in the case, and the controversy was only in construing the notice of appeal to\n       determine whether the appellant sufficiently invoked review of the order.\n\n\u00b6 30      Here, the dispute is focused not on the scope of the notice of appeal but rather\n       on the broader question of whether Rule 304(a) could give the appellate court\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f       jurisdiction to review the substitution of judge rulings.

In an\n       interlocutory appeal under Rule 304(a), the circuit court has determined that, in\n       spite of the court\u2019s general policy disfavoring fragmented appeals, \u201cthere is no just\n       reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both\u201d of a particular \u201cfinal\n       judgment.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351830\"><a href=\"/opinion/351830/elfman-motors-inc-v-chrysler-corporation-chrysler-motors-corporation/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> In this manner, a Rule 304(a) appeal is limited in scope and does not\n       pave the way for review of all prior orders.

Accordingly, even if petitioner\n       had expressly listed the substitution of judge rulings in his notice of appeal along\n       with the orders specified in the Rule 304(a) findings, Rule 304(a) would not give\n       the appellate court jurisdiction to review the rulings on the substitution requests.\n\n\u00b6 31       One could argue that review of certain orders appealed under Rule 304(a) could\n       require review of prior rulings in order to address the merits of the particular order\n       appealed.

Petitioner argues that, by\n       considering the denial of a petition for substitution of judge during an interlocutory\n       appeal, we would be promoting the efficient use of judicial and party resources\n       during the proceedings. Respondent counters that, if we allow jurisdiction, it could\n       open the floodgates to appellate challenges by parties who seek to upend the\n       progress of their cases, as they could file pretextual requests for injunctions and\n       then obtain appeals to also challenge the rulings on the substitution motions.\n\n\u00b6 33       We note that this marriage dissolution case has been litigated for more than 10\n       years even without a reversal of a substitution of judge ruling, which suggests that\n       considerations of judicial economy and the preservation of party resources have not\n       been top of mind. More significantly, \u201c[p]rinciples of judicial economy may not\n       trump the jurisdictional barrier erected by\u201d an Illinois Supreme Court rule. People\n       v.

There is no Illinois Supreme Court rule\n       that independently allows for an appeal from an interlocutory order resolving a\n       petition or motion for substitution of judge.

Chatman, with four\n     counts of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1)-(3) (West 2018)) in connection\n     with the shooting death of Ricky Green. Prior to trial, the State sought to introduce\n     statements made by Dominique \u201cDee\u201d Collins, who was unable to be located, under\n     the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule (Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5)\n\f     (eff. Jan. 1, 2011)) and the sixth amendment confrontation clause (U.S. Const.,\n     amend. VI). The Champaign County circuit court allowed Collins\u2019s statements to\n     be introduced, finding him unavailable and that the State had made reasonable,\n     good-faith efforts to secure his presence at trial. A jury found defendant guilty of\n     felony murder, and the court sentenced him to prison. The appellate court affirmed.\n     2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b62       Now on appeal, defendant argues the State was required to demonstrate good-\n     faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s presence at trial but failed to do so. We affirm.\n\n\n\u00b63                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64        Not long after midnight on March 23, 2018, Ricky Green was shot twice and\n     killed in Champaign. Shortly before his death, Green was in a car with defendant,\n     codefendant Michael Simmons, and Kotia Fairman. After police officers followed\n     their car, Green, defendant, and Simmons ran because they had guns and drugs in\n     the car. While they fled, an altercation ensued between Green and defendant, during\n     which defendant shot Green. Items tied to defendant and Simmons were later found\n     in the car, including a .357 Magnum revolver, which was not used to shoot Green.\n\n\u00b65        Based on this incident, the State charged defendant with unlawful possession of\n     a firearm by a felon and obstruction of justice. In August 2018, defendant pleaded\n     guilty and received a sentence of probation. The State did not charge him with\n     Green\u2019s murder until January 2020. This occurred after the State on December 30,\n     2019, secured a video-recorded statement from Dee Collins, wherein he related to\n     Detective Jeremiah Christian that defendant had confessed to Collins shortly after\n     the shooting.\n\n\u00b66        In October 2020, the State filed a motion in limine to admit Collins\u2019s statements\n     due to forfeiture by wrongdoing. The motion alleged Collins was interviewed on\n     December 30, 2019, after his arrest on a traffic warrant. Collins said he had been\n     with defendant the morning after the shooting when defendant bragged about\n     killing Green. Defendant told Collins that he, Simmons, and Green were in the back\n     seat of a vehicle and defendant had planned to rob Green of a gun. As they fled\n     from the police, defendant grabbed Green\u2019s gun. When Green later tried to retrieve\n     it, defendant feared for his safety and shot Green.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f\u00b67       The motion claimed defendant talked in recorded jailhouse phone calls about\n     Collins speaking to the police and making sure he did not testify. Although\n     defendant did not give specific orders during the calls to prevent Collins from\n     testifying, defendant\u2019s father and brother indicated they would ensure Collins\n     would not cooperate with the police or appear at trial. On February 16, 2020,\n     Collins sent an officer a text message that read, \u201cEverybody think I told on Mikey\n     [(Defendant)] idk how they getting this information I\u2019ve been getting threats from\n     a lot of people.\u201d Collins fled to Iowa. On March 12, 2020, Collins met with a\n     detective in Iowa and stated he had been receiving threatening text messages and\n     social media posts from people associated with defendant and Simmons. The\n     motion claimed Collins had moved out of state because he feared for his life. On\n     October 9, 2020, Detective Christian sent a text message to Collins\u2019s phone\n     number. Collins initially did not respond, but a later response said Christian had the\n     wrong number.\n\n\u00b68       In February 2021, the circuit court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motion. The\n     State introduced defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls pertaining to Collins and\n     Collins\u2019s December 2019 video-recorded statement. Following arguments, the\n     court found the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\n     intended by his actions to prevent Collins, a material witness, from testifying. The\n     court reserved the issue of whether the State had made reasonable efforts to secure\n     Collins\u2019s presence for a later hearing.\n\n\u00b69       That hearing took place on May 6, 2021, and Detective Christian testified\n     regarding his efforts to locate Collins. He tried locating Collins on February 16,\n     2021, through a posting on \u201cI-Board,\u201d an intelligence-based software program that\n     disseminates information locally to various law-enforcement agencies and all\n     officers. He reposted it on April 28 and May 5. Christian indicated the postings had\n     been viewed 119 times without a response. He noted Collins had not been listed as\n     a missing person in LEADS 1 or on any list with the Federal Bureau of\n     Investigation.\n\n\n\n\n         1 LEADS is Illinois\u2019s Law Enforcement Agencies Data System. See, e.g., 20 ILCS 2605/2605-\n\n     375 (West 2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f\u00b6 10       Prior to the reasonable efforts hearing, Christian had traveled to Iowa to meet\n       with Collins. He later communicated with law enforcement in Davenport, Iowa, in\n       hopes of finding him. Christian testified he served a subpoena in Aurora on\n       Demetria Chatman, defendant\u2019s mother, who was also related to Collins, but denied\n       any contact with Collins. In listening to defendant\u2019s jailhouse calls, Christian\n       indicated defendant told a third party that he and his counsel had been unable to\n       contact Collins. Christian stated he had received information that Collins was in\n       Indianapolis \u201cfor a show\u201d but provided no other details.\n\n\u00b6 11      Following the testimony, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n             \u201cWe\u2019re looking under Illinois Rules of Evidence number 804 that indicates\n          a witness is unavailable if the proponent of the statement has been unable to\n          procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means.\n\n               So the real question here is whether or not the State has made good faith\n          efforts to present Mr. Collins as a witness at trial here. Is there something\n          somebody could always do more? I suppose there is. I suppose the deputy\u2014the\n          officer could have gone back to Davenport recently, but he went there once.\n          There is no such thing as a national database. He\u2019s really not a missing person.\n          I think he could best be described as Officer Christian indicated, he\u2019s somebody\n          who didn\u2019t want to be found.\n\n              I\u2019m not sure how effective putting it on this board was when it was really\n          just local, but he did contact law enforcement in the Davenport, Iowa, area, and\n          they hadn\u2019t had any contact with him in a number of years. I don\u2019t know who\n          he spoke to, but the witness did indicate that everybody he had spoken to,\n          nobody knew the whereabouts. And although it doesn\u2019t\u2014at first blush, it\n          sounded like attorney-client information, Ms. Alferink [(assistant state\u2019s\n          attorney)] clarified that it appeared that Mr. Chatman made some statements to\n          other individuals indicating that he believes that Mr. Collins is\u2014cannot be\n          found even by the defense. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. But the real\n          question is whether or not the State has used good faith efforts and used\n          reasonable means and effort. And based on the totality of the circumstances\n          here, the Court is going to make that finding. And, therefore, the Court is going\n          to show that the State has tried to get Mr. Collins\u2019 attendance by process or\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f          other reasonable means. They\u2019ve used good faith effort. They\u2019ve been unable\n          to do so. And, therefore, the statements will be admissible.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 12       Prior to the start of defendant\u2019s trial in September 2021, the circuit court held a\n       second hearing on the State\u2019s efforts to locate Collins. Detective Christian testified\n       that the I-Board posting regarding Collins had been viewed more than 250 times\n       since the last posting. In August 2021, Christian researched various databases in\n       search of a recent address for Collins. He and another police detective went to an\n       address of an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but there appeared\n       to be no one inside. They also went to a house on Springfield Avenue in Champaign\n       that Collins had used in 2018, but Christian said the house appeared to be vacant\n       and no one answered the door. Christian stated he went to the residence of Collins\u2019s\n       brother, Devonte McCormick, on Dale Drive in Champaign but, although there\n       were vehicles in the driveway and Christian suspected people were inside, no one\n       answered the door.\n\n\u00b6 13       Christian stated he traveled out of state to a home linked to Collins but there\n       was no one inside, and Christian had no reason to think Collins lived there any\n       longer. Christian also stated he and a detective traveled to Kendall County to check\n       two addresses linked to Collins, but they received no answer at either location.\n\n\u00b6 14       On cross-examination, Christian testified no warrants had been issued for\n       Collins and no request had been put into LEADS to find him. The last time\n       Christian dialed Collins\u2019s phone number, he heard a voice he did not recognize, and\n       the man said he had the wrong number.\n\n\u00b6 15      Following arguments, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n          \u201cWell, the Court has already found that there was forfeiture by wrongdoing.\n          The issue now is whether or not the State has made reasonable efforts to show\n          that Mr. Collins is unavailable. I did find that back in May. And now I\u2019ve heard\n          more testimony about what efforts have been made since this time. And Mr.\n          Nolan [(defense counsel)] argues that it was a half-hearted attempt that they\n          knocked on a door and heard some noise and left, and that\u2019s true. But most of\n          the other arguments that Mr. Nolan makes really are not persuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f              In terms of putting someone into LEADS for statewide. I heard the\n          testimony that you would need a warrant, and there\u2019s no warrant, and so it\n          would not be allowed into LEADS. He\u2019s *** unaware of the database for the\n          FBI and how that has to be done. And, in fact, Ms. Alferink just indicated here\n          that although she did get a warrant for several other witnesses, that\u2019s because\n          they had been served with a subpoena and Mr. Collins had not.\n\n              What I did hear is that there has been continued effort to put this person on\n          the iBoard, which of course is more locally centralized. But if you have\n          detectives in our area working on other cases, they may hear nuggets about Mr.\n          Collins, so it is a useful tool, although it is somewhat local. But he did go to a\n          number of addresses. He called some numbers. He went out of state.\n\n              He has made in my opinion reasonable efforts. Not perfect efforts. Not all\n          the efforts that could possibly be made, but reasonable efforts. And the State\n          simply has to show this that the witness is unavailable by preponderance of the\n          evidence, which I certainly do find at this time.\n\n             Therefore, the Court is going to find reasonable efforts to locate Mr. Collins\n          have failed. He is unavailable. The statements will come in pursuant to the\n          Court\u2019s previous order.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16       The case then proceeded to a jury trial. As the appellate court laid out the\n       testimony and evidence in its opinion, we will summarize only those facts necessary\n       to fully analyze the issues on appeal. The trial testimony established that, on the\n       afternoon before Green\u2019s murder, defendant and Simmons planned to steal Green\u2019s\n       gun. In the evening, defendant sent Facebook messages to Green inviting him to\n       get together with him and Simmons. The three went to a party before leaving and\n       picking up Kotia Fairman.\n\n\u00b6 17        Defendant later heard from his mother, who asked them to pick her up at a\n       trailer park. Upon arrival, they saw police in the area, so they parked near the\n       entrance. Earlier, Calvin Wilson, who was dating defendant\u2019s mother, had told\n       police about a domestic dispute they had that evening. Wilson told police that\n       defendant might have information and described the car he was in.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\f\u00b6 18      Shortly after midnight, police officers saw a car that matched Wilson\u2019s\n       description of the one in which defendant had been riding. When officers\n       approached, the driver of the car drove off. The officers eventually found the car\n       parked in the middle of the street. Fairman was walking around the car, but\n       defendant, Green, and Simmons were no longer there. Inside the car, officers found\n       Simmons\u2019s identification, defendant\u2019s cell phone, and a .357 Magnum revolver.\n\n\u00b6 19       As officers approached the vehicle, they heard yelling and gunshots in the\n       distance. Another officer responded to a call of shots fired and discovered Green\n       lying in the street. Green, who had been shot in his groin and shoulder, later died at\n       the hospital. A brown left boot was found near Green\u2019s body, and a brown right\n       boot was found under a nearby parked car. Forensic testing determined that DNA\n       on the left boot was consistent with defendant\u2019s DNA profile.\n\n\u00b6 20      In the early morning hours, defendant knocked on the door of Alexandrinique\n       Anderson and asked to use her phone. Defendant was barefoot at the time and told\n       her he had come from the trailer park where he had been attacked by \u201csome\n       Mexicans\u201d and had to defend himself.\n\n\u00b6 21       The video recording of Collins\u2019s statement to the police was played for the jury.\n       Collins said that, on the morning after Green\u2019s murder, defendant arrived at\n       Collins\u2019s brother\u2019s home without any socks or shoes. Defendant told Collins that\n       he tried to take Green\u2019s gun and run but Green chased him, so defendant turned\n       around and shot him twice. Defendant then ran away.\n\n\u00b6 22       Police interviewed defendant two days after the murder and again in October\n       2019. During both interviews, he denied shooting Green. He said he jumped out of\n       the car to run from police, heard shots, ran faster, and lost his shoes. The State\u2019s\n       evidence included incriminating statements defendant made during his jailhouse\n       phone calls while he was in custody on the gun possession charge and later on the\n       murder charge.\n\n\u00b6 23       Defendant also confessed to Dennis Griham while they were housed in the same\n       cellblock of the county jail in February 2020. Griham, who was in prison at the time\n       of defendant\u2019s trial, testified defendant stated he and Simmons had called Green\n       and told him they \u201chad a lick, which meant something had come up.\u201d They picked\n       up Green, \u201crolled around for a little while,\u201d and wound up at a trailer park.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       Defendant told Griham he \u201ctussl[ed]\u201d with Green for the gun and defendant\n       \u201caccidentally shot Mr. Green in the chest twice.\u201d Defendant stated he ran, lost one\n       of his boots, and hid.\n\n\u00b6 24       Defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed the text messages between\n       him and Simmons were not about robbing Green. Instead, he, Simmons, and Green\n       planned to steal guns from Green\u2019s friends. When the police attempted to stop their\n       vehicle, the men \u201cstarted tucking guns under the seat.\u201d When their car stopped,\n       defendant grabbed a gun and ran. After defendant and Green stopped running,\n       Green asked for his gun. Defendant wanted to get away from the police first, but\n       Green \u201cgot aggressive.\u201d Green grabbed him, and defendant tried to get away. When\n       Green continued to grab defendant and put a hand on his shoulder, defendant tried\n       to run and then shot him. With Green still on him, defendant fired again. Defendant\n       then ran and hid under a car.\n\n\u00b6 25        Defendant stated he never went to Devonte McCormick\u2019s house and never saw\n       Collins on the morning after the shooting. Defendant also testified that Griham\n       asked a lot of questions about his case but twisted his words and \u201cmade up his own\n       little story.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26       The jury found defendant guilty of felony murder. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3) (West\n       2018). Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for acquittal or, in the alternative, for a\n       new trial, arguing inter alia that the State did not meet its burden of proving\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing to admit Collins\u2019s statement. The circuit court denied the\n       motion and sentenced defendant to 55 years in prison.\n\n\u00b6 27       Defendant appealed, arguing the circuit court erred in finding the State made\n       reasonable, good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial. 2022 IL App\n       (4th) 210716, \u00b6 46. Initially, the Fourth District agreed with defendant that the State\n       is required, in the context of Rule 804(a)(5) (Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1,\n       2011)), to show that reasonable, good-faith efforts were made to procure a witness\u2019s\n       attendance. 2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 54. The appellate court went on, however,\n       to find the State\u2019s efforts to locate Collins were reasonable and thus the circuit\n       court\u2019s similar finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. \u00b6 64.\n       The Fourth District affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. Id. \u00b6 73.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f\u00b6 28       In November 2022, defendant petitioned this court for leave to appeal, and we\n       allowed that petition. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 29                                      ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 30       Defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues this court should adopt\n       the Fourth District\u2019s holding that, when seeking to introduce hearsay statements\n       under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception, the State must demonstrate its good-\n       faith efforts to procure a witness\u2019s attendance where the witness is allegedly\n       unavailable due to the opposing party\u2019s wrongdoing. Second, he argues the State\n       failed to show good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s presence at trial. Third, he\n       argues the circuit court\u2019s error in admitting Collins\u2019s statement violated his\n       constitutional right to confront a witness against him and that the error was not\n       harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\u00b6 31                              I. Forfeiture by Wrongdoing\n\n\u00b6 32      The common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing serves both as an\n       exception to the hearsay rule and to the confrontation clause of the sixth\n       amendment. People v. Hanson, 238 Ill. 2d 74, 96-97 (2010); Crawford v.\n       Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 62 (2004). The doctrine is codified in Illinois Rule of\n       Evidence 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) and Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6).\n       People v. Peterson, 2017 IL 120331, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n\u00b6 33       Ordinarily, the rule against hearsay would prohibit the introduction at trial of\n       out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Id. \u00b6 17.\n       However, the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception in Rule 804(b)(5) provides that\n       \u201c[a] statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing\n       that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a\n       witness\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1,\n       2011).\n\n\u00b6 34       As the proponent of the hearsay here, the State had the burden of proving by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that defendant engaged in wrongdoing that was\n       intended to, and did, procure Collins\u2019s unavailability. Peterson, 2017 IL 120331,\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f       \u00b6 39. Where the circuit court makes a finding by a preponderance of the evidence,\n       that finding will only be reversed if it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n       Id. \u201cA finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence where \u2018the opposite\n       conclusion is clearly evident or if the finding itself is unreasonable, arbitrary, or not\n       based on the evidence presented.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting People v. Deleon, 227 Ill. 2d 322,\n       332 (2008)).\n\n\u00b6 35       In this case, defendant does not challenge the circuit court\u2019s finding that he\n       engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing to prevent Collins from testifying. Instead,\n       his arguments center on Collins\u2019s unavailability and his belief that the State was\n       required to demonstrate good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial.\n\n\u00b6 36       For the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to apply, the declarant must be\n       unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a) defines\n       \u201cunavailability as a witness\u201d and lists five situations in which a witness may be\n       found to be unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Here, only one\n       scenario applies\u2014where the declarant \u201cis absent from the hearing and the\n       proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance ***\n       by process or other reasonable means.\u201d Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011).\n\n\u00b6 37       Illinois Rule of Evidence 804 is modeled after Federal Rule of Evidence 804,\n       and this court may look to federal law as guidance in determining the State\u2019s\n       obligations in seeking to introduce the statements of an unavailable witness. See\n       People v. Thompson, 2016 IL 118667, \u00b6 40. In analyzing an exception to the\n       confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court has stated a declarant is not\n       unavailable \u201c \u2018unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to\n       obtain his presence at trial.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56,\n       74 (1980) (quoting Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725 (1968)).\n\n\u00b6 38       In the appellate court, the State relied on People v. Golden, 2021 IL App (2d)\n       200207, in arguing the prosecutor need not make good-faith efforts to secure a\n       witness\u2019s testimony if the statements are being admitted under Rule 804(b)(5). In\n       Golden, the defendant had argued Rule 804(b)(5) included the requirement under\n       Rule 804(a)(5) \u201cthat the proponent of the hearsay statement demonstrate an\n       inability to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable\n       means.\u201d Id. \u00b6 70. The Second District disagreed and stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f              \u201cRule 804 governs exceptions to the rule against hearsay where the\n          declarant is unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a)(5)\n          expressly encompasses situations in which the declarant \u2018is absent from the\n          hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the\n          declarant\u2019s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision\n          (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony) by process or other\n          reasonable means.\u2019 Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). By its very terms,\n          then, Rule 804(a)(5) does not apply to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing\n          as codified in Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. \u00b6 71.\n\n\u00b6 39       In support of its conclusion, the Second District went on to cite this court\u2019s\n       decision in Peterson, which stated Rule 804(b)(5) \u201c \u2018identifies only two criteria or\n       factors that must be satisfied for the admission of hearsay statements under the\n       rule:\u2019 wrongdoing on the part of the defendant and evidence that the wrongdoing\n       was committed with the intent to, and did, render the witness unavailable to testify.\u201d\n       Id. \u00b6 72 (quoting Peterson, 2017 IL 120331, \u00b6 32). The court also cited People v.\n       Zimmerman, 2018 IL App (4th) 170695, \u00b6 98, which found Rule 804(b)(5) only has\n       those same two factors that must be satisfied. Golden, 2021 IL App (2d) 200207,\n       \u00b6 72. The Second District believed this interpretation of Rule 804(b)(5) \u201cdoes not\n       require the State to demonstrate in any particular manner that the witness was\n       unavailable despite its best efforts to procure the witness\u2019s attendance.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 40       The Fourth District in this case disagreed with Golden as it related to the plain\n       language of Rule 804(a)(5). 2022 IL App (4th) 210716, \u00b6 51. In looking at Rule\n       804(a), the appellate court stated \u201csubdivision (a)(5) applies to subdivisions (b)(1)\n       and (5) when the declarant\u2019s attendance cannot be procured and to subdivisions\n       (b)(2), (3), and (4) when either the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony cannot be\n       procured\u201d as those subdivisions apply to dying declarations, statements against\n       interest, and statements of personal or family history. Id. \u00b6 51 & n.2. Thus, the court\n       concluded Rule 804(a)(5) applied to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing. Id.\n       \u00b6 51.\n\n\u00b6 41        The Fourth District also rejected Golden\u2019s reliance on Peterson and\n       Zimmerman, stating neither addressed the interaction between subdivisions (a)(5)\n       and (b)(5) of Rule 804. Id. \u00b6 52. \u201cPeterson addressed whether additional indicia of\n       reliability were required to introduce a hearsay statement where the defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f       procured the declarant\u2019s unavailability by killing them and Zimmerman addressed\n       what types of statements were admissible under Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. The Fourth\n       District held that, \u201cbecause a witness must be unavailable as a prerequisite to\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing, it falls on the proponent of the statement to demonstrate\n       unavailability by a preponderance of the evidence in some manner under Rule\n       804(a).\u201d Id. \u00b6 53.\n\n\u00b6 42       As the State contended Collins could not be located and thus could not be served\n       or otherwise compelled to come to court, the Fourth District found it fell \u201cwithin\n       the purview of Rule 804(a)(5) and require[d] the State to show that good-faith\n       reasonable efforts were made to procure the witnesses\u2019 attendance by a\n       preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Id. \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 43       We note the State here has abandoned any reliance on Golden and does not cite\n       the opinion in its brief to this court. Even if it did, on the issue of the State\u2019s\n       obligations under Rule 804(a)(5) and (b)(5), we find the Fourth District\u2019s reasoning\n       is correct. The plain language of Rule 804(b)(5) requires the unavailability of a\n       witness, and Rule 804(a) defines unavailability. When considering a witness\u2019s\n       unavailability in the confrontation clause context, this court has required the State\n       to \u201c \u2018either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose\n       statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d People v. Torres, 2012 IL\n       111302, \u00b6 54 (quoting People v. Bowen, 183 Ill. 2d 103, 118 (1998)); see also\n       Roberts, 448 U.S. at 74 (stating a witness is not unavailable under the sixth\n       amendment unless the prosecutor has made good-faith efforts to obtain his presence\n       at trial). The same applies when the State seeks to introduce hearsay statements\n       under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception.\n\n\u00b6 44       Accordingly, we hold that, when the State seeks to introduce hearsay under this\n       exception, the State must demonstrate that the witness is unavailable and that\n       reasonable, good-faith efforts were made to procure the witness\u2019s attendance by a\n       preponderance of the evidence. To the extent Golden holds the proponent of\n       statements of an unavailable witness under Rule 804(b)(5) need not demonstrate\n       good-faith efforts in securing that witness\u2019s attendance at trial, that portion of the\n       opinion is hereby overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 45                           II. Reasonable, Good-Faith Efforts\n\n\u00b6 46       Now that we have found, as did the Fourth District, that the State is required to\n       demonstrate good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s attendance at trial, we turn next\n       to the question of whether the efforts made in this case were reasonable.\n\n\u00b6 47      In defining the good-faith requirement, several general propositions have\n       emerged, namely:\n\n          \u201c \u2018The law does not require the doing of a futile act. Thus, if no possibility of\n          procuring the witness exists (as, for example, the witness\u2019 intervening death),\n          \u201cgood faith\u201d demands nothing of the prosecution. But if there is a possibility,\n          albeit remote, that affirmative measures might produce the declarant, the\n          obligation of good faith may demand their effectuation. \u201cThe lengths to which\n          the prosecution must go to produce a witness ... is a question of reasonableness.\u201d\n          [Citation.] The ultimate question is whether the witness is unavailable despite\n          good-faith efforts undertaken prior to trial to locate and present that witness. As\n          with other evidentiary proponents, the prosecution bears the burden of\n          establishing this predicate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Torres, 2012 IL 111302,\n          \u00b6 54 (quoting Roberts, 448 U.S. at 74-75).\n\n\u00b6 48       \u201c[W]hen a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of\n       additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness\u2019\n       presence [citation], but the Sixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to\n       exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\u201d Hardy v. Cross, 565\n       U.S. 65, 71-72 (2011) (per curiam). Moreover, a good-faith effort \u201cis not an ends-\n       of-the-earth effort.\u201d United States v. Chun Ya Cheung, 350 Fed. App\u2019x 19, 23 (6th\n       Cir. 2009). \u201cWhether good-faith and reasonable diligence have been exercised is\n       determined on a case-by-case basis after a careful review of the facts and\n       circumstances.\u201d People v. Smith, 275 Ill. App. 3d 207, 215 (1995).\n\n\u00b6 49       In this case, Collins received numerous threats from defendant\u2019s family and\n       friends and, as a result, fled to Iowa in February 2020. He initially met with\n       detectives in Iowa in March 2020, and nothing indicated he planned on not\n       cooperating with police or intended to move elsewhere. However, he eventually\n       stopped responding, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f\u00b6 50       Detective Christian testified that, when he last attempted to call Collins\u2019s phone\n       number, he did not recognize the voice of the person who answered and that person\n       said he had the wrong number. In his attempts to find Collins, Christian posted\n       Collins\u2019s information on the I-Board in February 2021, alerting local law-\n       enforcement agencies and officers. He reposted the information in April and May\n       2021. Although the posting was viewed hundreds of times, Christian did not receive\n       any responses. He also contacted law-enforcement officers in Davenport, Iowa, but\n       they had no contact with Collins.\n\n\u00b6 51       In August 2021, Christian also researched various databases to try to locate a\n       recent address for Collins. After doing so, he and another detective attempted to\n       make contact at an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but no one\n       appeared to be inside. They went to Collins\u2019s former address on Springfield Avenue\n       in Champaign, but it appeared no one lived at the house. They went to the residence\n       of Collins\u2019s brother on Dale Drive in Champaign, but although Christian suspected\n       people were inside, no one answered the door. Detectives traveled to an address in\n       Iowa, but no one was at the house. They also tried two addresses in Kendall County\n       without success.\n\n\u00b6 52       Christian served a subpoena in Aurora on defendant\u2019s mother, who was related\n       to Collins, and she stated she had no contact with Collins. None of defendant\u2019s\n       other family members provided any information on Collins\u2019s whereabouts.\n       Defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls indicated that he and his counsel had been unable\n       to locate Collins.\n\n\u00b6 53       From all accounts, Collins did not want to be found. Notwithstanding that fact,\n       Detective Christian utilized the information available to him in an ongoing attempt\n       to find him. Through the I-Board postings, the phone call to Collins\u2019s last known\n       number, and the visits to multiple addresses in different counties and different\n       states, Christian made good-faith efforts to locate Collins without success. While\n       the State\u2019s efforts might not be considered extraordinary, the question here is\n       whether the efforts to locate Collins were reasonable. We find that they were.\n\n\u00b6 54      Defendant, however, argues more could have been done. Specifically,\n       defendant argues the State could have mailed subpoenas to the addresses Collins\n       was affiliated with, Collins could have been listed as a missing person in LEADS,\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f       and Collins\u2019s phone records could have been subpoenaed to help learn his\n       whereabouts.\n\n\u00b6 55       We find the success of the proposed actions speculative at best. As to the\n       mailing of a subpoena, there is no indication that Collins was living at any of the\n       addresses Christian visited, and thus any such attempt at mailing the subpoena\n       would most likely have been futile. Christian also testified he could not place\n       Collins\u2019s information in LEADS because he had not been served with a subpoena.\n       A missing person can be placed into LEADS when there is a reasonable concern\n       for that person\u2019s safety, but it requires a \u201cmissing person report,\u201d and Collins was\n       not so much missing as he was intentionally not wanting to be found. See LEADS\n       3.0 Manual, Ill. State Police (Apr. 25, 2022), https://isp.illinois.gov/Law\n       Enforcement/LEADS3Manual                [https://perma.cc/HT2W-94JV].         Lastly,\n       subpoenaing Collins\u2019s phone records would not guarantee finding him, given his\n       clear intention not to be discovered. See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 76 (noting \u201cthe great\n       improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\n       would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept\n       of reasonableness required their execution\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 56       Defendant also cites several cases that he contends show what reasonable,\n       good-faith efforts look like and how they, when compared to this case, prove the\n       State\u2019s efforts were deficient. See e.g., United States v. Smith, 928 F.3d 1215 (11th\n       Cir. 2019); People v. Payne, 30 Ill. App. 3d 624 (1975). However, these cases and\n       others like them deal with facts that are distinguishable from those of the case\n       before us. Moreover, the reasonableness of the State\u2019s efforts depends on an\n       analysis of the specific facts of each individual case, eschewing a rigid case-by-\n       case comparison. See United States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31, 36 (2003) (treating\n       \u201creasonableness as a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is\n       likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of circumstances in a\n       given case\u201d); Smith, 928 F.3d at 1228 (noting \u201cthere is no brightline rule for\n       reasonableness\u201d and \u201ca reasonableness inquiry necessarily is fact-specific and\n       examines the totality of the factual circumstances of each particular case\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 57      While \u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things\u201d (Roberts, 448\n       U.S. at 75), nothing indicates Christian learned of tips or leads about Collins\u2019s\n       whereabouts and failed to follow up on them. Although the State\u2019s efforts in\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f       locating Collins failed to bear fruit, they were in the end reasonable. Given the\n       totality of the facts and circumstances here, the circuit court\u2019s finding that the State\n       made reasonable, good-faith efforts to locate Collins was not against the manifest\n       weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 58       As we find no error in the admission of Collins\u2019s statements, we need not\n       address defendant\u2019s final claim that the introduction of the statements violated his\n       right to confront a witness against him.\n\n\n\u00b6 59                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 60       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment, which\n       affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n\n\n\u00b6 61      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 129133</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 129133)\n\n               THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Appellee, v.\n                      MICHEAL D.

Chatman, with four\n     counts of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1)-(3) (West 2018)) in connection\n     with the shooting death of Ricky Green. Prior to trial, the State sought to introduce\n     statements made by Dominique \u201cDee\u201d Collins, who was unable to be located, under\n     the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule (Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5)\n\f     (eff. Jan. 1, 2011)) and the sixth amendment confrontation clause (U.S. Const.,\n     amend. VI). The Champaign County circuit court allowed Collins\u2019s statements to\n     be introduced, finding him unavailable and that the State had made reasonable,\n     good-faith efforts to secure his presence at trial. A jury found defendant guilty of\n     felony murder, and the court sentenced him to prison. The appellate court affirmed.\n     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (4th) 210716</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b62       Now on appeal, defendant argues the State was required to demonstrate good-\n     faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s presence at trial but failed to do so. We affirm.\n\n\n\u00b63                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64        Not long after midnight on March 23, 2018, Ricky Green was shot twice and\n     killed in Champaign. Shortly before his death, Green was in a car with defendant,\n     codefendant Michael Simmons, and Kotia Fairman. After police officers followed\n     their car, Green, defendant, and Simmons ran because they had guns and drugs in\n     the car. While they fled, an altercation ensued between Green and defendant, during\n     which defendant shot Green. Items tied to defendant and Simmons were later found\n     in the car, including a .357 Magnum revolver, which was not used to shoot Green.\n\n\u00b65        Based on this incident, the State charged defendant with unlawful possession of\n     a firearm by a felon and obstruction of justice. In August 2018, defendant pleaded\n     guilty and received a sentence of probation. The State did not charge him with\n     Green\u2019s murder until January 2020. This occurred after the State on December 30,\n     2019, secured a video-recorded statement from Dee Collins, wherein he related to\n     Detective Jeremiah Christian that defendant had confessed to Collins shortly after\n     the shooting.\n\n\u00b66        In October 2020, the State filed a motion in limine to admit Collins\u2019s statements\n     due to forfeiture by wrongdoing. The motion alleged Collins was interviewed on\n     December 30, 2019, after his arrest on a traffic warrant. Collins said he had been\n     with defendant the morning after the shooting when defendant bragged about\n     killing Green. Defendant told Collins that he, Simmons, and Green were in the back\n     seat of a vehicle and defendant had planned to rob Green of a gun. As they fled\n     from the police, defendant grabbed Green\u2019s gun. When Green later tried to retrieve\n     it, defendant feared for his safety and shot Green.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f\u00b67       The motion claimed defendant talked in recorded jailhouse phone calls about\n     Collins speaking to the police and making sure he did not testify. Although\n     defendant did not give specific orders during the calls to prevent Collins from\n     testifying, defendant\u2019s father and brother indicated they would ensure Collins\n     would not cooperate with the police or appear at trial. On February 16, 2020,\n     Collins sent an officer a text message that read, \u201cEverybody think I told on Mikey\n     [(Defendant)] idk how they getting this information I\u2019ve been getting threats from\n     a lot of people.\u201d Collins fled to Iowa. On March 12, 2020, Collins met with a\n     detective in Iowa and stated he had been receiving threatening text messages and\n     social media posts from people associated with defendant and Simmons. The\n     motion claimed Collins had moved out of state because he feared for his life. On\n     October 9, 2020, Detective Christian sent a text message to Collins\u2019s phone\n     number. Collins initially did not respond, but a later response said Christian had the\n     wrong number.\n\n\u00b68       In February 2021, the circuit court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motion. The\n     State introduced defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls pertaining to Collins and\n     Collins\u2019s December 2019 video-recorded statement. Following arguments, the\n     court found the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\n     intended by his actions to prevent Collins, a material witness, from testifying. The\n     court reserved the issue of whether the State had made reasonable efforts to secure\n     Collins\u2019s presence for a later hearing.\n\n\u00b69       That hearing took place on May 6, 2021, and Detective Christian testified\n     regarding his efforts to locate Collins. He tried locating Collins on February 16,\n     2021, through a posting on \u201cI-Board,\u201d an intelligence-based software program that\n     disseminates information locally to various law-enforcement agencies and all\n     officers. He reposted it on April 28 and May 5. Christian indicated the postings had\n     been viewed 119 times without a response. He noted Collins had not been listed as\n     a missing person in LEADS 1 or on any list with the Federal Bureau of\n     Investigation.\n\n\n\n\n         1 LEADS is Illinois\u2019s Law Enforcement Agencies Data System. See, e.g., 20 ILCS 2605/2605-\n\n     375 (West 2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f\u00b6 10       Prior to the reasonable efforts hearing, Christian had traveled to Iowa to meet\n       with Collins. He later communicated with law enforcement in Davenport, Iowa, in\n       hopes of finding him. Christian testified he served a subpoena in Aurora on\n       Demetria Chatman, defendant\u2019s mother, who was also related to Collins, but denied\n       any contact with Collins. In listening to defendant\u2019s jailhouse calls, Christian\n       indicated defendant told a third party that he and his counsel had been unable to\n       contact Collins. Christian stated he had received information that Collins was in\n       Indianapolis \u201cfor a show\u201d but provided no other details.\n\n\u00b6 11      Following the testimony, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n             \u201cWe\u2019re looking under Illinois Rules of Evidence number 804 that indicates\n          a witness is unavailable if the proponent of the statement has been unable to\n          procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means.\n\n               So the real question here is whether or not the State has made good faith\n          efforts to present Mr. Collins as a witness at trial here. Is there something\n          somebody could always do more? I suppose there is. I suppose the deputy\u2014the\n          officer could have gone back to Davenport recently, but he went there once.\n          There is no such thing as a national database. He\u2019s really not a missing person.\n          I think he could best be described as Officer Christian indicated, he\u2019s somebody\n          who didn\u2019t want to be found.\n\n              I\u2019m not sure how effective putting it on this board was when it was really\n          just local, but he did contact law enforcement in the Davenport, Iowa, area, and\n          they hadn\u2019t had any contact with him in a number of years. I don\u2019t know who\n          he spoke to, but the witness did indicate that everybody he had spoken to,\n          nobody knew the whereabouts. And although it doesn\u2019t\u2014at first blush, it\n          sounded like attorney-client information, Ms. Alferink [(assistant state\u2019s\n          attorney)] clarified that it appeared that Mr. Chatman made some statements to\n          other individuals indicating that he believes that Mr. Collins is\u2014cannot be\n          found even by the defense. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. But the real\n          question is whether or not the State has used good faith efforts and used\n          reasonable means and effort. And based on the totality of the circumstances\n          here, the Court is going to make that finding. And, therefore, the Court is going\n          to show that the State has tried to get Mr. Collins\u2019 attendance by process or\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f          other reasonable means. They\u2019ve used good faith effort. They\u2019ve been unable\n          to do so. And, therefore, the statements will be admissible.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 12       Prior to the start of defendant\u2019s trial in September 2021, the circuit court held a\n       second hearing on the State\u2019s efforts to locate Collins. Detective Christian testified\n       that the I-Board posting regarding Collins had been viewed more than 250 times\n       since the last posting. In August 2021, Christian researched various databases in\n       search of a recent address for Collins. He and another police detective went to an\n       address of an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but there appeared\n       to be no one inside. They also went to a house on Springfield Avenue in Champaign\n       that Collins had used in 2018, but Christian said the house appeared to be vacant\n       and no one answered the door. Christian stated he went to the residence of Collins\u2019s\n       brother, Devonte McCormick, on Dale Drive in Champaign but, although there\n       were vehicles in the driveway and Christian suspected people were inside, no one\n       answered the door.\n\n\u00b6 13       Christian stated he traveled out of state to a home linked to Collins but there\n       was no one inside, and Christian had no reason to think Collins lived there any\n       longer. Christian also stated he and a detective traveled to Kendall County to check\n       two addresses linked to Collins, but they received no answer at either location.\n\n\u00b6 14       On cross-examination, Christian testified no warrants had been issued for\n       Collins and no request had been put into LEADS to find him. The last time\n       Christian dialed Collins\u2019s phone number, he heard a voice he did not recognize, and\n       the man said he had the wrong number.\n\n\u00b6 15      Following arguments, the circuit judge stated as follows:\n\n          \u201cWell, the Court has already found that there was forfeiture by wrongdoing.\n          The issue now is whether or not the State has made reasonable efforts to show\n          that Mr. Collins is unavailable. I did find that back in May. And now I\u2019ve heard\n          more testimony about what efforts have been made since this time. And Mr.\n          Nolan [(defense counsel)] argues that it was a half-hearted attempt that they\n          knocked on a door and heard some noise and left, and that\u2019s true. But most of\n          the other arguments that Mr. Nolan makes really are not persuasive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f              In terms of putting someone into LEADS for statewide. I heard the\n          testimony that you would need a warrant, and there\u2019s no warrant, and so it\n          would not be allowed into LEADS. He\u2019s *** unaware of the database for the\n          FBI and how that has to be done. And, in fact, Ms. Alferink just indicated here\n          that although she did get a warrant for several other witnesses, that\u2019s because\n          they had been served with a subpoena and Mr. Collins had not.\n\n              What I did hear is that there has been continued effort to put this person on\n          the iBoard, which of course is more locally centralized. But if you have\n          detectives in our area working on other cases, they may hear nuggets about Mr.\n          Collins, so it is a useful tool, although it is somewhat local. But he did go to a\n          number of addresses. He called some numbers. He went out of state.\n\n              He has made in my opinion reasonable efforts. Not perfect efforts. Not all\n          the efforts that could possibly be made, but reasonable efforts. And the State\n          simply has to show this that the witness is unavailable by preponderance of the\n          evidence, which I certainly do find at this time.\n\n             Therefore, the Court is going to find reasonable efforts to locate Mr. Collins\n          have failed. He is unavailable. The statements will come in pursuant to the\n          Court\u2019s previous order.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16       The case then proceeded to a jury trial. As the appellate court laid out the\n       testimony and evidence in its opinion, we will summarize only those facts necessary\n       to fully analyze the issues on appeal. The trial testimony established that, on the\n       afternoon before Green\u2019s murder, defendant and Simmons planned to steal Green\u2019s\n       gun. In the evening, defendant sent Facebook messages to Green inviting him to\n       get together with him and Simmons. The three went to a party before leaving and\n       picking up Kotia Fairman.\n\n\u00b6 17        Defendant later heard from his mother, who asked them to pick her up at a\n       trailer park. Upon arrival, they saw police in the area, so they parked near the\n       entrance. Earlier, Calvin Wilson, who was dating defendant\u2019s mother, had told\n       police about a domestic dispute they had that evening. Wilson told police that\n       defendant might have information and described the car he was in.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\f\u00b6 18      Shortly after midnight, police officers saw a car that matched Wilson\u2019s\n       description of the one in which defendant had been riding. When officers\n       approached, the driver of the car drove off. The officers eventually found the car\n       parked in the middle of the street. Fairman was walking around the car, but\n       defendant, Green, and Simmons were no longer there. Inside the car, officers found\n       Simmons\u2019s identification, defendant\u2019s cell phone, and a .357 Magnum revolver.\n\n\u00b6 19       As officers approached the vehicle, they heard yelling and gunshots in the\n       distance. Another officer responded to a call of shots fired and discovered Green\n       lying in the street. Green, who had been shot in his groin and shoulder, later died at\n       the hospital. A brown left boot was found near Green\u2019s body, and a brown right\n       boot was found under a nearby parked car. Forensic testing determined that DNA\n       on the left boot was consistent with defendant\u2019s DNA profile.\n\n\u00b6 20      In the early morning hours, defendant knocked on the door of Alexandrinique\n       Anderson and asked to use her phone. Defendant was barefoot at the time and told\n       her he had come from the trailer park where he had been attacked by \u201csome\n       Mexicans\u201d and had to defend himself.\n\n\u00b6 21       The video recording of Collins\u2019s statement to the police was played for the jury.\n       Collins said that, on the morning after Green\u2019s murder, defendant arrived at\n       Collins\u2019s brother\u2019s home without any socks or shoes. Defendant told Collins that\n       he tried to take Green\u2019s gun and run but Green chased him, so defendant turned\n       around and shot him twice. Defendant then ran away.\n\n\u00b6 22       Police interviewed defendant two days after the murder and again in October\n       2019. During both interviews, he denied shooting Green. He said he jumped out of\n       the car to run from police, heard shots, ran faster, and lost his shoes. The State\u2019s\n       evidence included incriminating statements defendant made during his jailhouse\n       phone calls while he was in custody on the gun possession charge and later on the\n       murder charge.\n\n\u00b6 23       Defendant also confessed to Dennis Griham while they were housed in the same\n       cellblock of the county jail in February 2020. Griham, who was in prison at the time\n       of defendant\u2019s trial, testified defendant stated he and Simmons had called Green\n       and told him they \u201chad a lick, which meant something had come up.\u201d They picked\n       up Green, \u201crolled around for a little while,\u201d and wound up at a trailer park.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       Defendant told Griham he \u201ctussl[ed]\u201d with Green for the gun and defendant\n       \u201caccidentally shot Mr. Green in the chest twice.\u201d Defendant stated he ran, lost one\n       of his boots, and hid.\n\n\u00b6 24       Defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed the text messages between\n       him and Simmons were not about robbing Green. Instead, he, Simmons, and Green\n       planned to steal guns from Green\u2019s friends. When the police attempted to stop their\n       vehicle, the men \u201cstarted tucking guns under the seat.\u201d When their car stopped,\n       defendant grabbed a gun and ran. After defendant and Green stopped running,\n       Green asked for his gun. Defendant wanted to get away from the police first, but\n       Green \u201cgot aggressive.\u201d Green grabbed him, and defendant tried to get away. When\n       Green continued to grab defendant and put a hand on his shoulder, defendant tried\n       to run and then shot him. With Green still on him, defendant fired again. Defendant\n       then ran and hid under a car.\n\n\u00b6 25        Defendant stated he never went to Devonte McCormick\u2019s house and never saw\n       Collins on the morning after the shooting. Defendant also testified that Griham\n       asked a lot of questions about his case but twisted his words and \u201cmade up his own\n       little story.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26       The jury found defendant guilty of felony murder. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3) (West\n       2018). Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for acquittal or, in the alternative, for a\n       new trial, arguing inter alia that the State did not meet its burden of proving\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing to admit Collins\u2019s statement. The circuit court denied the\n       motion and sentenced defendant to 55 years in prison.\n\n\u00b6 27       Defendant appealed, arguing the circuit court erred in finding the State made\n       reasonable, good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App\n       (4th) 210716</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 46.

Jan. 1,\n       2011)), to show that reasonable, good-faith efforts were made to procure a witness\u2019s\n       attendance. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (4th) 210716</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 54.

First, he argues this court should adopt\n       the Fourth District\u2019s holding that, when seeking to introduce hearsay statements\n       under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception, the State must demonstrate its good-\n       faith efforts to procure a witness\u2019s attendance where the witness is allegedly\n       unavailable due to the opposing party\u2019s wrongdoing. Second, he argues the State\n       failed to show good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s presence at trial. Third, he\n       argues the circuit court\u2019s error in admitting Collins\u2019s statement violated his\n       constitutional right to confront a witness against him and that the error was not\n       harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\u00b6 31                              I. Forfeiture by Wrongdoing\n\n\u00b6 32      The common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing serves both as an\n       exception to the hearsay rule and to the confrontation clause of the sixth\n       amendment.

Id. \u00b6 17.\n       However, the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception in Rule 804(b)(5) provides that\n       \u201c[a] statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing\n       that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a\n       witness\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule.

Instead,\n       his arguments center on Collins\u2019s unavailability and his belief that the State was\n       required to demonstrate good-faith efforts to procure Collins\u2019s attendance at trial.\n\n\u00b6 36       For the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to apply, the declarant must be\n       unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a) defines\n       \u201cunavailability as a witness\u201d and lists five situations in which a witness may be\n       found to be unavailable.

In\n       Golden, the defendant had argued Rule 804(b)(5) included the requirement under\n       Rule 804(a)(5) \u201cthat the proponent of the hearsay statement demonstrate an\n       inability to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable\n       means.\u201d Id. \u00b6 70. The Second District disagreed and stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f              \u201cRule 804 governs exceptions to the rule against hearsay where the\n          declarant is unavailable. Ill. R. Evid. 804 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Rule 804(a)(5)\n          expressly encompasses situations in which the declarant \u2018is absent from the\n          hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the\n          declarant\u2019s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision\n          (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant\u2019s attendance or testimony) by process or other\n          reasonable means.\u2019 Ill. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). By its very terms,\n          then, Rule 804(a)(5) does not apply to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing\n          as codified in Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. \u00b6 71.\n\n\u00b6 39       In support of its conclusion, the Second District went on to cite this court\u2019s\n       decision in Peterson, which stated Rule 804(b)(5) \u201c \u2018identifies only two criteria or\n       factors that must be satisfied for the admission of hearsay statements under the\n       rule:\u2019 wrongdoing on the part of the defendant and evidence that the wrongdoing\n       was committed with the intent to, and did, render the witness unavailable to testify.\u201d\n       Id. \u00b6 72 (quoting Peterson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2017 IL 120331</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 32).

Id. \u00b6 52. \u201cPeterson addressed whether additional indicia of\n       reliability were required to introduce a hearsay statement where the defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f       procured the declarant\u2019s unavailability by killing them and Zimmerman addressed\n       what types of statements were admissible under Rule 804(b)(5).\u201d Id. The Fourth\n       District held that, \u201cbecause a witness must be unavailable as a prerequisite to\n       forfeiture by wrongdoing, it falls on the proponent of the statement to demonstrate\n       unavailability by a preponderance of the evidence in some manner under Rule\n       804(a).\u201d Id. \u00b6 53.\n\n\u00b6 42       As the State contended Collins could not be located and thus could not be served\n       or otherwise compelled to come to court, the Fourth District found it fell \u201cwithin\n       the purview of Rule 804(a)(5) and require[d] the State to show that good-faith\n       reasonable efforts were made to procure the witnesses\u2019 attendance by a\n       preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Id. \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 43       We note the State here has abandoned any reliance on Golden and does not cite\n       the opinion in its brief to this court. Even if it did, on the issue of the State\u2019s\n       obligations under Rule 804(a)(5) and (b)(5), we find the Fourth District\u2019s reasoning\n       is correct. The plain language of Rule 804(b)(5) requires the unavailability of a\n       witness, and Rule 804(a) defines unavailability. When considering a witness\u2019s\n       unavailability in the confrontation clause context, this court has required the State\n       to \u201c \u2018either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose\n       statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d People v.

To the extent Golden holds the proponent of\n       statements of an unavailable witness under Rule 804(b)(5) need not demonstrate\n       good-faith efforts in securing that witness\u2019s attendance at trial, that portion of the\n       opinion is hereby overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 45                           II. Reasonable, Good-Faith Efforts\n\n\u00b6 46       Now that we have found, as did the Fourth District, that the State is required to\n       demonstrate good-faith efforts in securing Collins\u2019s attendance at trial, we turn next\n       to the question of whether the efforts made in this case were reasonable.\n\n\u00b6 47      In defining the good-faith requirement, several general propositions have\n       emerged, namely:\n\n          \u201c \u2018The law does not require the doing of a futile act. Thus, if no possibility of\n          procuring the witness exists (as, for example, the witness\u2019 intervening death),\n          \u201cgood faith\u201d demands nothing of the prosecution. But if there is a possibility,\n          albeit remote, that affirmative measures might produce the declarant, the\n          obligation of good faith may demand their effectuation. \u201cThe lengths to which\n          the prosecution must go to produce a witness ... is a question of reasonableness.\u201d\n          [Citation.] The ultimate question is whether the witness is unavailable despite\n          good-faith efforts undertaken prior to trial to locate and present that witness. As\n          with other evidentiary proponents, the prosecution bears the burden of\n          establishing this predicate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.)

He initially met with\n       detectives in Iowa in March 2020, and nothing indicated he planned on not\n       cooperating with police or intended to move elsewhere. However, he eventually\n       stopped responding, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f\u00b6 50       Detective Christian testified that, when he last attempted to call Collins\u2019s phone\n       number, he did not recognize the voice of the person who answered and that person\n       said he had the wrong number. In his attempts to find Collins, Christian posted\n       Collins\u2019s information on the I-Board in February 2021, alerting local law-\n       enforcement agencies and officers. He reposted the information in April and May\n       2021. Although the posting was viewed hundreds of times, Christian did not receive\n       any responses. He also contacted law-enforcement officers in Davenport, Iowa, but\n       they had no contact with Collins.\n\n\u00b6 51       In August 2021, Christian also researched various databases to try to locate a\n       recent address for Collins. After doing so, he and another detective attempted to\n       make contact at an apartment complex on Green Street in Champaign, but no one\n       appeared to be inside. They went to Collins\u2019s former address on Springfield Avenue\n       in Champaign, but it appeared no one lived at the house. They went to the residence\n       of Collins\u2019s brother on Dale Drive in Champaign, but although Christian suspected\n       people were inside, no one answered the door. Detectives traveled to an address in\n       Iowa, but no one was at the house. They also tried two addresses in Kendall County\n       without success.\n\n\u00b6 52       Christian served a subpoena in Aurora on defendant\u2019s mother, who was related\n       to Collins, and she stated she had no contact with Collins. None of defendant\u2019s\n       other family members provided any information on Collins\u2019s whereabouts.\n       Defendant\u2019s jailhouse phone calls indicated that he and his counsel had been unable\n       to locate Collins.\n\n\u00b6 53       From all accounts, Collins did not want to be found. Notwithstanding that fact,\n       Detective Christian utilized the information available to him in an ongoing attempt\n       to find him. Through the I-Board postings, the phone call to Collins\u2019s last known\n       number, and the visits to multiple addresses in different counties and different\n       states, Christian made good-faith efforts to locate Collins without success. While\n       the State\u2019s efforts might not be considered extraordinary, the question here is\n       whether the efforts to locate Collins were reasonable. We find that they were.\n\n\u00b6 54      Defendant, however, argues more could have been done. Specifically,\n       defendant argues the State could have mailed subpoenas to the addresses Collins\n       was affiliated with, Collins could have been listed as a missing person in LEADS,\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f       and Collins\u2019s phone records could have been subpoenaed to help learn his\n       whereabouts.\n\n\u00b6 55       We find the success of the proposed actions speculative at best. As to the\n       mailing of a subpoena, there is no indication that Collins was living at any of the\n       addresses Christian visited, and thus any such attempt at mailing the subpoena\n       would most likely have been futile. Christian also testified he could not place\n       Collins\u2019s information in LEADS because he had not been served with a subpoena.\n       A missing person can be placed into LEADS when there is a reasonable concern\n       for that person\u2019s safety, but it requires a \u201cmissing person report,\u201d and Collins was\n       not so much missing as he was intentionally not wanting to be found. See LEADS\n       3.0 Manual, Ill. State Police (Apr. 25, 2022), https://isp.illinois.gov/Law\n       Enforcement/LEADS3Manual                [https://perma.cc/HT2W-94JV].         Lastly,\n       subpoenaing Collins\u2019s phone records would not guarantee finding him, given his\n       clear intention not to be discovered. See Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\">448 U.S. at 76</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (noting \u201cthe great\n       improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\n       would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept\n       of reasonableness required their execution\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 56       Defendant also cites several cases that he contends show what reasonable,\n       good-faith efforts look like and how they, when compared to this case, prove the\n       State\u2019s efforts were deficient. See e.g., United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">928 F.3d 1215</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th\n       Cir. 2019); People v.

However, these cases and\n       others like them deal with facts that are distinguishable from those of the case\n       before us. Moreover, the reasonableness of the State\u2019s efforts depends on an\n       analysis of the specific facts of each individual case, eschewing a rigid case-by-\n       case comparison. See United States v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131146\"><a href=\"/opinion/131146/united-states-v-banks/\">540 U.S. 31</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (2003) (treating\n       \u201creasonableness as a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is\n       likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of circumstances in a\n       given case\u201d); Smith, 928 F.3d at 1228 (noting \u201cthere is no brightline rule for\n       reasonableness\u201d and \u201ca reasonableness inquiry necessarily is fact-specific and\n       examines the totality of the factual circumstances of each particular case\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 57      While \u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things\u201d (Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\">448\n       U.S. at 75</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), nothing indicates Christian learned of tips or leads about Collins\u2019s\n       whereabouts and failed to follow up on them. Although the State\u2019s efforts in\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f       locating Collins failed to bear fruit, they were in the end reasonable.

Frey, was convicted in the circuit court of Lee County of\n     three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child (720 ILCS 5/11-\n     1.40(a)(1) (West 2010)). The court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms\n     totaling 50 years. The appellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence. People\n     v. Frey, 2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U. Petitioner then filed a pro se postconviction\n\f     petition. See 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U. The trial court appointed counsel for\n     petitioner when it failed to rule on the petition within 90 days. Id. \u00b6 9. Counsel later\n     moved to withdraw, arguing that petitioner had no meritorious claims. Id. \u00b6 10. The\n     trial court granted the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 11. The State moved to dismiss the\n     petition, adopting counsel\u2019s arguments from the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n     trial court granted the motion to dismiss. Id. The appellate court vacated and\n     remanded with directions, holding that postconviction counsel did not provide\n     reasonable assistance of counsel when he failed to ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s\n     claims. Id. \u00b6 36. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the\n     appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       The State charged petitioner with three counts of predatory criminal sexual\n     assault of a child. The State alleged that petitioner committed three acts of sexual\n     penetration on his 12-year-old daughter. The cause proceeded to a jury trial.\n     Approximately two hours into its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge\n     asking whether the burden of proof required physical evidence. The court, with the\n     consent of the parties, responded, \u201c[y]ou are to decide this case based on the\n     evidence you have seen and heard together with the instructions I have given you.\u201d\n     Later that evening, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts. The court\n     polled the jurors, and each confirmed that this was his or her verdict. The court\n     denied petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to consecutive prison\n     terms of 10, 15, and 25 years.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting certain\n     testimony from petitioner\u2019s stepson and a letter that petitioner had written to the\n     state\u2019s attorney. Frey, 2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U, \u00b6 47. The appellate court held\n     that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony from\n     petitioner\u2019s stepson. Id. \u00b6 57. As for the letter, the court concluded that its probative\n     value outweighed any prejudice to petitioner. Id. \u00b6 61. However, the court then\n     explained that, even if it were to agree with petitioner that the prejudice arising\n     from the letter outweighed its probative value, any error in admitting it was\n     harmless. Id. \u00b6 62. In arguing against the error being harmless, petitioner contended\n     that it was a close case. Id. \u00b6 63. He relied on the note from the jury asking whether\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f     physical evidence was required for the State to meet its burden of proof. Id.\n     Petitioner also relied on a second jury note explaining that the jurors were initially\n     deadlocked. Id. \u00b6 63 n.2. However, the appellate court concluded that this note was\n     not sent to the trial court:\n\n              \u201cThe defendant also points out that the record contains a second note\n         apparently written by the jury, which reads, \u2018Please advise\u2014We have 10 guilty\n         (all 3 counts) 2 not guilty all 3 counts. The 2 not guilty are firm that the State\n         did not prove guilt on all the counts.\u2019 However, there is absolutely no indication\n         in the record as to the source of this note. The trial transcript reflects that the\n         jury retired to deliberate about 4 p.m. About 6 p.m., it sent out the note regarding\n         physical evidence, and the trial court called the attorneys back to discuss the\n         appropriate response, which it then delivered to the jury. The bailiff notified the\n         court that the jury had reached a verdict shortly before 10 p.m. There is no\n         mention whatsoever of the second note regarding the 10-2 split in the jury, and\n         no explanation for its presence in the common law record. Accordingly, we\n         have difficulty in determining what weight, if any, should be placed on the\n         second note. Ordinarily, when the record is silent on a point, we must presume\n         that the trial court acted in conformity with the law. In re Estate of Cargola,\n         2017 IL App (1st) 151823, \u00b6 17. A trial court generally must address on the\n         record any notes it receives from the jury. See People v. Childs, 159 Ill. 2d 217,\n         228-29 (1994). We presume that the trial court\u2019s failure to address the second\n         note on the record indicates that the jury ultimately chose not to send out the\n         second note. This presumption is buttressed by the fact that the trial court took\n         great pains to properly address the note it received about physical evidence.\u201d\n         Id.\n\n     Finally, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s cumulative error argument. Id. \u00b6 64. The\n     court noted that, even if it viewed the admission of the letter as error, a petitioner\n     cannot argue cumulative error based on one error. Id.\n\n\u00b65       Petitioner then filed the pro se postconviction petition that is the subject of this\n     appeal. See 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U. In the body of the petition, petitioner\n     presents two claims for relief: an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a\n     proportionate penalties sentencing claim. The petition begins by explaining that\n     \u201c[t]he main claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Over the next two pages,\n\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f     petitioner details five specific ways in which he believed that trial counsel was\n     ineffective. On the next page, he argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for\n     failing to raise the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. He next alleges\n     that both trial and appellate counsel \u201cfell short when it comes to the investigation\n     done in this case.\u201d In the concluding paragraph of the ineffective assistance of\n     counsel portion of the petition, petitioner quotes Justice Black\u2019s dissent in Betts v.\n     Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 476 (1942) (Black, J., dissenting, joined by Douglas and\n     Murphy, JJ.), for the proposition that \u201c[w]hether a man is innocent cannot be\n     determined from a trial in which, as here, denial of counsel has made it impossible\n     to conclude, with any satisfactory degree of certainty, that the defendant\u2019s case was\n     adequately presented.\u201d In the next two sentences, he argues that he is entitled to a\n     new trial because he has met both prongs of the Strickland test. See Strickland v.\n     Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The concluding sentence of this final paragraph\n     is: \u201cThe initial jury could not agree on a guilty verdict in this case, yet the Judge\n     told them they could not leave that night unless they all agreed on something, being\n     outnumbered and pressured they took the defendants [sic] freedom!\u201d\n\n\u00b66       On the next page of the petition, petitioner presents his proportionate penalties\n     claim. The claim is set forth in a paragraph titled \u201cConstitutional Violation.\u201d\n     Petitioner begins by noting that he was sentenced to a total of 50 years after a jury\n     verdict in which two jurors initially voted not guilty. Petitioner asserts that the judge\n     told the jurors that they should continue deliberating and that they could not leave\n     until they agree. Petitioner then says that this caused him to be sentenced to a\n     de facto life sentence and that the court failed to consider his rehabilitative\n     potential. Petitioner cites the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois\n     Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 11) and argues that he will likely not survive\n     his time in prison. Petitioner argued that the court imposing a sentence that will not\n     allow him to ever again be a productive citizen disregarded the central goal of our\n     penal system.\n\n\u00b67       The next two pages of the petition are petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Appointment of\n     Counsel.\u201d Petitioner explains that he is without sufficient funds to pay for the costs\n     of the proceedings or to hire an attorney, that he has a constitutional right to access\n     to the courts, and that his claims are not frivolous.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f\u00b68         Petitioner appended to the petition the affidavit of his sister, Roxanne Shaffer.\n       The affidavit is preceded by a page titled \u201cNewly Discovered Evidence.\u201d In a\n       paragraph, he explains the significance of Shaffer\u2019s affidavit:\n\n          \u201cOn July 25, 2019 Roxanne Shaffer made a Sworn Affidavit on behalf of the\n          defendant which is claiming a violation of the defendants [sic] right to due\n          process by forcing the jury to come to a unanimous verdict or they were not\n          allowed to leave that night despite a 10-2 verdict! Failure of trial counsel to\n          fully depose all witnesses also adds this to the claim for ineffective assistance\n          of trial counsel.\u201d\n\n\u00b69         In Shaffer\u2019s affidavit, she says that at approximately 9 p.m. on the date of her\n       brother\u2019s conviction, the jury sent a note saying that the verdict was 10 to 2.\n       According to Shaffer, the jurors asked if they could continue the next day, but the\n       judge denied the request, saying that he had a murder trial beginning the next day\n       and that he did not want to postpone it. Within half an hour to 45 minutes, the jury\n       came back with a guilty verdict. Shaffer said that she believed that this took away\n       petitioner\u2019s right to due process.\n\n\u00b6 10       On May 13, 2020, the trial court appointed attorney Eric Arnquist to represent\n       petitioner. The court explained that it was appointing counsel because the 90-day\n       time frame for entering an order on the petition had elapsed.\n\n\u00b6 11        On October 13, 2020, Arnquist filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for\n       petitioner. In the motion, Arnquist noted that the petition had not received a first\n       stage review by the trial court. Arnquist contended that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked\n       merit and that, pursuant to People v. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, he would explain\n       why. Arnquist then went through petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of\n       trial and appellate counsel and explained why they lacked merit. He next explained\n       why petitioner\u2019s sentencing claim lacked merit. Arnquist concluded the motion\n       with a certificate pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Arnquist certified that he had consulted with petitioner to ascertain his contentions\n       of constitutional rights, had examined the record of proceedings from the trial, and\n       had made any amendments to the pro se petition that were necessary for an\n       adequate presentation of petitioner\u2019s contentions.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f\u00b6 12       At a hearing on the motion, Arnquist said that he reviewed his motion to\n       withdraw in detail with petitioner. Arnquist further explained that he had reviewed\n       the record on multiple occasions and had considered every page of it. He also\n       reviewed everything that petitioner had filed and all correspondence with\n       petitioner. He also reviewed the appellate court decision in the original appeal.\n       Arnquist said that petitioner had asked him to reach out to potential witnesses and\n       that he had done so. However, he was not able to make contact with everyone that\n       petitioner wanted him to. The court asked petitioner if he had reviewed the motion\n       to withdraw with Arnquist. Petitioner responded, \u201cYeah. I object to him\n       withdrawing.\u201d The court then granted the motion to withdraw, explaining that it\n       agreed with Arnquist\u2019s assessment of the issues.\n\n\u00b6 13       The State then asked for leave of court to file a motion to dismiss instanter. The\n       court granted the motion. In the motion, the State adopted the reasoning and\n       conclusions of Arnquist\u2019s motion to withdraw. At a hearing on the motion to\n       dismiss, the State stood on the motion. The court asked petitioner if he had anything\n       to argue in response to the State\u2019s motion. Petitioner responded that he had asked\n       Arnquist to make some phone calls and that Arnquist had not made them. The court\n       then asked petitioner if he had anything to argue in response to the motion to\n       dismiss. Petitioner responded, \u201cOther than the fact that my trial lawyer didn\u2019t do\n       everything he could to get me a not-guilty verdict. That\u2019s all I can argue with.\u201d The\n       court then asked petitioner if he had anything else to argue. Petitioner responded,\n       \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The court granted the motion to dismiss, stating that it agreed\n       with Arnquist\u2019s assessment that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit.\n\n\u00b6 14       Petitioner appealed, arguing that postconviction counsel did not provide\n       reasonable assistance under Rule 651(c) because his motion to withdraw failed to\n       address petitioner\u2019s due process claim concerning the jury note. Accordingly, he\n       contended that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing postconviction\n       counsel to withdraw. 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 14. The appellate court agreed\n       with petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 15      The court noted that Rule 651(c) prescribes specific duties to ensure that\n       postconviction petitioners receive a reasonable level of assistance. Id. \u00b6 20. If, after\n       demonstrating compliance with Rule 651(c), counsel determines that the pro se\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       petition is frivolous or patently without merit, counsel may move to withdraw. Id.\n       \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 16       The court explained that its review of an order permitting withdrawal differs\n       based on how the petition arrived at the second stage. Id. \u00b6 23. If the petition\n       advanced to the second stage because the trial court found it potentially meritorious,\n       then the motion to withdraw must contain at least some explanation as to why all\n       of the claims set forth in the petition are so lacking in legal and factual support that\n       withdrawal is allowed. Id. (citing Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 27). If, however, the\n       petition advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, \u201c \u2018judicial\n       economy sometimes dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where\n       the motion to withdraw is deficient.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 24 (quoting People v. Moore, 2018 IL\n       App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 38). The court noted that, in that situation, withdrawal may be\n       allowed if counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and the record demonstrates that the\n       claims in the pro se petition are frivolous or patently without merit. Id. \u00b6 26.\n       However, the court explained it had previously held in Moore that, even when the\n       petition advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, appointed\n       counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw must address the potential merit of all the petition\u2019s\n       claims. Id. \u00b6 27. In the court\u2019s view, the duty of counsel is the same no matter how\n       the petition advances to the second stage. The difference is that, when the petition\n       advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, judicial economy may\n       sometimes warrant affirming the grant of a motion to withdraw even in the face of\n       a deficient motion. Id.\n\n\u00b6 17       The court explained that it held in Moore that, when the motion to withdraw\n       fails to address one of the pro se petitioner\u2019s claims, the case must be remanded\n       even when counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate. Id. \u00b6 28. Moore read People v.\n       Greer, 212 Ill. 2d 192 (2004), to hold that \u201c \u2018the reviewing court cannot relieve\n       counsel of his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u2019 \u201d\n       (Emphasis in original.) 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 27 (quoting Moore, 2018 IL\n       App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 43). The court explained that Moore stands for the proposition\n       that, if counsel does not address one of the pro se petition\u2019s claims in the motion to\n       withdraw, then counsel has not fulfilled his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to\n       ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 28.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f\u00b6 18        The court then held that the present case is governed by Moore. The court noted\n       that counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw did not mention \u201cthe claim based on the second\n       jury note or any of the circumstances surrounding the claim.\u201d Id. \u00b6 29. The court\n       rejected the State\u2019s argument that, when a petition advances to the second stage\n       based on trial court inaction, the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate is sufficient to\n       raise a presumption that counsel complied with the rule. Id. \u00b6 30. The court\n       explained that it would not \u201cpresume compliance when the record suggests\n       otherwise.\u201d Id. \u00b6 31. The court believed that the petition, liberally construed, set\n       forth a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id. \u00b6 32. The court rejected\n       the State\u2019s assertion that petitioner had forfeited the claim by not raising the issue\n       pro se at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Id. The court noted that the State had\n       failed to cite any authority for applying forfeiture in such a manner as to excuse an\n       attorney\u2019s lack of compliance with Rule 651(c). Id. Moreover, the court held that\n       petitioner\u2019s statement at the hearing that his counsel did not make requested phone\n       calls and did not \u201c \u2018do everything he could to get [defendant] a not-guilty verdict\u2019 \u201d\n       fairly encompassed a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id.\n       Accordingly, as it had done in Moore, the court vacated the orders allowing the\n       motion to withdraw and dismissing the petition and remanded the cause with\n       directions to appoint new postconviction counsel for petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 19      This court allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff.\n       Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n\n\u00b6 20                                        ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 21       On appeal, the State argues that the appellate court improperly applied the\n       Kuehner standard, which requires appointed counsel moving to withdraw to explain\n       why each of the claims in the pro se petition lacks merit. Because this petition\n       advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, the State argues that it\n       is governed by Greer. According to the State, the relevant inquiry under Greer is\n       whether (1) counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and (2) the petition\u2019s claims lack\n       merit. The State contends that counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and that a due\n       process claim based on the second jury note is frivolous and patently without merit.\n       Both the scope of an attorney\u2019s duties under Rule 651(c) and an attorney\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f       compliance with that rule are reviewed de novo. See People v. Smith, 2020 IL App\n       (1st) 181220, \u00b6 13.\n\n\u00b6 22       The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) provides a mechanism for a criminal\n       defendant to assert that \u201cin the proceedings which resulted in his or her conviction\n       there was a substantial denial of his or her rights under the Constitution of the\n       United States or of the State of Illinois or both.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122-1(a)(1) (West\n       2018). At the first stage of postconviction proceedings, the circuit court must\n       independently review the postconviction petition and shall dismiss it if it is\n       \u201cfrivolous or is patently without merit.\u201d Id. \u00a7 122-2.1(a)(2). The petition advances\n       to the second stage if (1) the court fails to rule on the petition within 90 days,\n       regardless of the petition\u2019s merit, or (2) the facts alleged in the petition state an\n       arguable claim of constitutional deprivation. People v. Urzua, 2023 IL 127789,\n       \u00b6 32.\n\n\u00b6 23       At the second stage, counsel may be appointed to assist an indigent defendant.\n       Id. \u00b6 33. In a postconviction proceeding, there is no constitutional right to the\n       assistance of counsel. People v. Custer, 2019 IL 123339, \u00b6 30. Rather, the right to\n       counsel is a matter of \u201clegislative grace.\u201d People v. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d 64, 73 (1988).\n       A postconviction petitioner is entitled only to the level of assistance granted by the\n       Act, which this court has determined to be a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 level of assistance\u201d\n       (People v. Flores, 153 Ill. 2d 264, 276 (1992)), which is less than that afforded by\n       the federal and state constitutions at trial (People v. Pendleton, 223 Ill. 2d 458, 472\n       (2006)).\n\n\u00b6 24      Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017), which governs the\n       appointment of counsel in postconviction proceedings provides, in part, as follows:\n\n              \u201cThe record filed in that court shall contain a showing, which may be made\n          by the certificate of petitioner\u2019s attorney, that the attorney has consulted with\n          petitioner by phone, mail, electronic means or in person to ascertain his or her\n          contentions of deprivation of constitutional rights, has examined the record of\n          the proceedings at the trial, and has made any amendments to the petitions filed\n          pro se that are necessary for an adequate presentation of petitioner\u2019s\n          contentions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f       Postconviction counsel\u2019s obligation is to investigate and properly present the claims\n       raised by the petitioner. Pendleton, 223 Ill. 2d at 472. Counsel may, but is not\n       required to, raise additional claims on the petitioner\u2019s behalf. Id. at 476. If counsel\n       files a certificate pursuant to Rule 651(c), a rebuttable presumption arises that the\n       petitioner received the reasonable assistance of counsel. People v. Addison, 2023\n       IL 127119, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 25       In Greer, this court explained that, when appointed counsel determines that the\n       claims in the petition lack merit and moves to withdraw, counsel \u201cshould make\n       some effort to explain why defendant\u2019s claims are frivolous or patently without\n       merit.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Greer, 212 Ill. 2d at 212. In that case, postconviction\n       counsel asserted that he could not \u201c \u2018properly substantiate\u2019 \u201d the petitioner\u2019s claim.\n       Id. at 200. Although this court cautioned that whether postconviction counsel can\n       properly substantiate a petitioner\u2019s claim is not the standard by which counsel\n       should be judging a petitioner\u2019s postconviction claim, this court stated that it would\n       not reverse the granting of the motion to withdraw when counsel fulfilled his Rule\n       651(c) duties and the record demonstrated that the petitioner\u2019s claims were\n       frivolous and without merit. Id. at 212.\n\n\u00b6 26       In Kuehner, this court was again faced with a situation in which appointed\n       counsel moved to withdraw but did not explain why each of the petitioner\u2019s issues\n       lacked merit. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 9. Counsel argued in her motion that the\n       petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit. She filed a supporting brief that addressed in detail\n       her reasons for concluding that two of the petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit. Counsel,\n       however, failed to address or even acknowledge one of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id.\n       This court explained that the case was in a different procedural posture than Greer.\n       Id. \u00b6 18. In Greer, the petition had advanced to the second stage when the court\n       failed to rule on the petition within 90 days. Id. \u00b6 19. In Kuehner, the petition\n       advanced to the second stage because the trial court determined that it was not\n       frivolous or patently without merit. Id. \u00b6 20. This court concluded that, when an\n       attorney moves to withdraw in that situation, he or she \u201cmay not simply move to\n       withdraw on the grounds that the pro se claims are frivolous or patently without\n       merit, as the trial court already has ruled expressly to the contrary.\u201d Id. \u00b6 21. Rather,\n       counsel must demonstrate, with respect to each of the pro se claims, \u201cwhy the trial\n       court\u2019s initial assessment was incorrect.\u201d Id. In other words, the court explained:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f          \u201cif we were willing to say in Greer that a motion to withdraw should include\n          such explanations when the petition advances to stage two by default, we are\n          now prepared to say that such a motion must include such explanations when\n          the petition advances to the second stage by affirmative judicial action.\u201d\n          (Emphasis in original.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 27       Taken together, Greer and Kuehner establish that, whether a petition advances\n       to the second stage based on judicial inaction or because the trial court found\n       potential merit to the claims, a properly filed motion to withdraw is one that sets\n       forth why the claims lack merit. This is confirmed by this court\u2019s recent decision in\n       Urzua, 2023 IL 127789. In that case, the petition advanced to the second stage\n       because of trial court inaction. Id. \u00b6 9. In setting forth the governing law, this court\n       cited Kuehner for the proposition that, when counsel determines that he is ethically\n       obligated to withdraw, \u201cappointed counsel must explain why each of the\n       petitioner\u2019s pro se claims lacks merit.\u201d Id. \u00b6 33.\n\n\u00b6 28       Thus, although counsel\u2019s obligation is the same in either scenario, the\n       consequences of filing a defective motion are potentially different. Kuehner\n       establishes a rule of automatic reversal if the petition has advanced based on a trial\n       court finding that the claims are potentially meritorious but counsel fails to address\n       one of those claims in the motion to withdraw. Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6\u00b6 22-\n       24. In a case in which the petition has advanced based on trial court inaction, this\n       court has recognized that, in certain circumstances, reversal is not required. In\n       Greer, this court chose not to reverse when it appeared that counsel had fulfilled\n       his duties under Rule 651(c) and the record showed that the petition was frivolous\n       and without merit. Greer, 212 Ill. 2d at 212. In other words, as the appellate court\n       has recognized, Greer stands for the proposition that \u201cjudicial economy sometimes\n       dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where the motion to withdraw\n       is deficient.\u201d Moore, 2018 IL App (2d) 170120, \u00b6 38.\n\n\u00b6 29       In this case, the appellate court adopted an approach that largely collapsed the\n       above framework. Although the court acknowledged and accepted the difference\n       between Kuehner and Greer (2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26), it then\n       adopted a framework that would require automatic reversal whenever a claim is not\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw. The court determined that, liberally construed,\n       petitioner\u2019s petition contained a due process claim based on the second jury note.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f       Id. \u00b6 32. The court believed that postconviction counsel\u2019s failure to mention this\n       claim in the motion to withdraw necessarily meant that counsel had failed to\n       ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 29. Thus, because Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claims, counsel had violated Rule 651(c) by failing\n       to address this claim in the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The court\n       acknowledged that counsel had filed a Rule 651(c) certificate (id. \u00b6 10) but\n       impliedly determined that petitioner had rebutted the presumption of reasonable\n       assistance arising from the certificate (id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). And, because Rule 651(c)\n       violations are not subject to harmless error analysis (id. \u00b6 28), reversal and remand\n       for the appointment of new counsel were required (id. \u00b6 34). The framework\n       adopted by the appellate court necessarily means that anytime a postconviction\n       petitioner can identify a claim that the petition can be liberally construed to assert,\n       automatic reversal is required if the claim is not mentioned in counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw.\n\n\u00b6 30       The problem with the appellate court\u2019s position is that it is not always possible\n       to discern what claims a pro se postconviction petitioner is raising. That is why\n       Rule 651(c) ties the \u201cascertainment\u201d requirement to a consultation requirement.\n       The requirement under Rule 651(c) is not merely to ascertain the petitioner\u2019s\n       claims, as the appellate court stated. See id. \u00b6 27. Rather, Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to certify that he or she \u201cconsulted with petitioner by phone, mail,\n       electronic means or in person to ascertain his or her contentions of deprivation of\n       constitutional rights.\u201d (Emphases added.) Ill. S. Ct. R. 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Postconviction counsel certified that he did so, following which he filed a motion\n       to withdraw that addressed petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and\n       sentencing claims. Because counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate, a rebuttable\n       presumption of reasonable assistance arose. Addison, 2023 IL 127119, \u00b6 21.\n       Petitioner can overcome that presumption by showing that postconviction counsel\n       did not substantially comply with the strictures of the rule. Id.\n\n\u00b6 31       We hold that petitioner did not rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance.\n       Nothing in the record establishes that counsel failed to consult with petitioner to\n       ascertain his claims of a deprivation of constitutional rights. The appellate court\n       concluded that petitioner rebutted the presumption because the petition could be\n       liberally construed to assert a due process claim. 2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U, \u00b6 32.\n       However, the petition was, at best, ambiguous on that matter, and postconviction\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f       counsel certified that he consulted with petitioner to ascertain his claims. Following\n       that consultation, he filed a motion to withdraw addressing the petition\u2019s ineffective\n       assistance of counsel and sentencing claims. There is nothing in the record to show\n       that counsel did not consult with petitioner to ascertain his claims. No one but\n       petitioner and postconviction counsel knows what was said during those\n       consultations. If petitioner confirmed that the claims he intended to raise were\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties claim, the record\n       would look precisely as it does now. Postconviction counsel addressed the merits\n       of those issues in his motion to withdraw, and he told the court that he went over\n       the motion in detail with petitioner. The trial court asked petitioner if he had\n       anything to say in response. Petitioner stated that he objected to counsel\n       withdrawing, but he did not say that counsel had overlooked any of his claims. At\n       the hearing on the motion to dismiss the petition, petitioner argued that he asked\n       postconviction counsel to make some phone calls and that counsel did not do so.\n       He also argued that he did not believe that trial counsel did everything he could to\n       obtain a not-guilty verdict. He did not mention a due process claim or state that one\n       had been overlooked by counsel. In pointing this out we are not, as petitioner\n       argues, holding that he forfeited a claim by his silence or that we are shifting part\n       of the burden to him. We are simply acknowledging that there is nothing in the\n       record to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose from counsel\u2019s\n       Rule 651(c) certificate. Moreover, we disagree with the appellate court\u2019s assertion\n       that petitioner stating that counsel did not make all requested phone calls and that\n       trial counsel did not do everything he could to get petitioner a not-guilty verdict\n       \u201cfairly encompassed the due process claim.\u201d See id. We do not see how this can be\n       understood to be referencing counsel overlooking a due process claim based on the\n       second jury note.\n\n\u00b6 32        The most natural way to read the petition is that it raises substantive claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties sentencing claim.\n       The petition is divided into three sections: (1) the substantive claims, (2) the motion\n       for the appointment of counsel, and (3) the supporting documentation. Although\n       the jury note is mentioned in both sections of the substantive portion of the petition,\n       it is tied to petitioner\u2019s other claims. There is no due process claim asserted in the\n       substantive portion of the petition. The only time due process is mentioned is in the\n       supporting documentation. Petitioner\u2019s sister claimed in her affidavit that the trial\n       judge denied the jurors\u2019 request to continue their deliberations the next day and that\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f       she \u201cbelieve[d] this took away [petitioner\u2019s] right of due process.\u201d On the preceding\n       page, petitioner described the affidavit and explained why he was attaching it. He\n       explained that it adds to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 33       It seems clear that this is how appointed counsel read the petition. He filed a\n       certificate pursuant to Rule 651(c) in which he stated that he consulted with\n       petitioner to ascertain his deprivation of constitutional rights. Counsel\u2019s failure to\n       mention a due process claim based on the second jury note strongly suggests that,\n       after consulting with petitioner, counsel reasonably ascertained that petitioner was\n       not asserting a standalone due process claim based on the second jury note. There\n       is no question that his intent was to address all of petitioner\u2019s claims in his motion\n       to withdraw. He stated in the motion that it was being filed pursuant to this court\u2019s\n       holding in Kuehner and that his obligation was to explain why all of the petition\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. In Kuehner, we held that postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw was required to address claims that were \u201cspecific, substantial, and\n       sufficiently present in the petition to warrant appointed counsel\u2019s attention.\u201d\n       Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 23. Counsel did so by addressing the claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing error.\n\n\u00b6 34        Petitioner relies on Moore, 2018 IL App (2d) 170120, in which the appellate\n       court held that the petitioner had failed to comply with Rule 651(c) when counsel\n       filed a motion to withdraw that omitted one of the petitioner\u2019s claims. The case had\n       proceeded to stage two when the trial court failed to rule on the petition within 90\n       days. The court held that counsel had failed to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claim that\n       appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge amendments to the\n       indictment. Id. \u00b6 41. The court acknowledged the pro se petition\u2019s \u201clength and\n       density\u201d but stated that it could not excuse compliance with Rule 651(c)\u2019s mandate\n       that counsel ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 42. The State argues that Moore\n       was incorrectly decided because (1) it decoupled the ascertainment requirement\n       from the consultation requirement and (2) the court failed to acknowledge\u2014let\n       alone apply\u2014the presumption that arises from the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate.\n       For purposes of this appeal, we do not need to address the correctness of Moore, as\n       it is clearly distinguishable. In Moore, there was an omitted claim that was clearly\n       stated in the petition. See id. \u00b6 24. Because we are not faced with that situation, we\n       have no need to weigh in on the correctness of that decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f\u00b6 35        Petitioner has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose\n       from counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We note that, in addition to arguing that\n       postconviction counsel complied with Rule 651(c), the State also argues that any\n       due process claim based on the second jury note would lack merit. Because this\n       case arose from a situation in which the petition proceeded to stage two because of\n       trial court inaction, the State contends that Greer applies and that the relevant\n       inquiry is whether counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and whether petitioner\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. As explained above, however, regardless of how the petition\n       arrives at the second stage, a proper motion to withdraw should explain why the\n       petition\u2019s claims lack merit. The separate Greer standard comes into play only\n       when the court is faced with a deficient motion to withdraw. That is not the situation\n       here. Petitioner has not established that the motion to withdraw was deficient.\n       Because petitioner failed to rebut the presumption that arose from counsel\u2019s Rule\n       651(c) certificate, we presume that the petitioner\u2019s claims are the ones counsel\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw, and petitioner has not challenged either\n       postconviction counsel\u2019s or the trial court\u2019s assessment of the merits of those\n       claims.\n\n\n\u00b6 36                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 37      Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance arising from\n       counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We therefore reverse the appellate court\u2019s\n       judgment. We affirm the trial court\u2019s orders allowing postconviction counsel to\n       withdraw and dismissing petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 38      Appellate court judgment reversed.\n\n\u00b6 39      Circuit court judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 128644</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                         IN THE\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n                                            OF\n                          THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                    (Docket No. 128644)\n\n               THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Appellant, v.\n                          RUSSELL A.

Frey, was convicted in the circuit court of Lee County of\n     three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child (720 ILCS 5/11-\n     1.40(a)(1) (West 2010)). The court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms\n     totaling 50 years. The appellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence. People\n     v. Frey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Petitioner then filed a pro se postconviction\n\f     petition. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The trial court appointed counsel for\n     petitioner when it failed to rule on the petition within 90 days. Id. \u00b6 9. Counsel later\n     moved to withdraw, arguing that petitioner had no meritorious claims. Id. \u00b6 10. The\n     trial court granted the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 11. The State moved to dismiss the\n     petition, adopting counsel\u2019s arguments from the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6 12. The\n     trial court granted the motion to dismiss. Id. The appellate court vacated and\n     remanded with directions, holding that postconviction counsel did not provide\n     reasonable assistance of counsel when he failed to ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s\n     claims. Id. \u00b6 36. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the\n     appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b62                                     BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63       The State charged petitioner with three counts of predatory criminal sexual\n     assault of a child. The State alleged that petitioner committed three acts of sexual\n     penetration on his 12-year-old daughter. The cause proceeded to a jury trial.\n     Approximately two hours into its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge\n     asking whether the burden of proof required physical evidence. The court, with the\n     consent of the parties, responded, \u201c[y]ou are to decide this case based on the\n     evidence you have seen and heard together with the instructions I have given you.\u201d\n     Later that evening, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts. The court\n     polled the jurors, and each confirmed that this was his or her verdict. The court\n     denied petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to consecutive prison\n     terms of 10, 15, and 25 years.\n\n\u00b64       Petitioner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting certain\n     testimony from petitioner\u2019s stepson and a letter that petitioner had written to the\n     state\u2019s attorney. Frey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 IL App (2d) 150868-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 47. The appellate court held\n     that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony from\n     petitioner\u2019s stepson. Id. \u00b6 57. As for the letter, the court concluded that its probative\n     value outweighed any prejudice to petitioner. Id. \u00b6 61. However, the court then\n     explained that, even if it were to agree with petitioner that the prejudice arising\n     from the letter outweighed its probative value, any error in admitting it was\n     harmless. Id. \u00b6 62. In arguing against the error being harmless, petitioner contended\n     that it was a close case. Id. \u00b6 63. He relied on the note from the jury asking whether\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f     physical evidence was required for the State to meet its burden of proof. Id.\n     Petitioner also relied on a second jury note explaining that the jurors were initially\n     deadlocked. Id. \u00b6 63 n.2. However, the appellate court concluded that this note was\n     not sent to the trial court:\n\n              \u201cThe defendant also points out that the record contains a second note\n         apparently written by the jury, which reads, \u2018Please advise\u2014We have 10 guilty\n         (all 3 counts) 2 not guilty all 3 counts. The 2 not guilty are firm that the State\n         did not prove guilt on all the counts.\u2019 However, there is absolutely no indication\n         in the record as to the source of this note. The trial transcript reflects that the\n         jury retired to deliberate about 4 p.m. About 6 p.m., it sent out the note regarding\n         physical evidence, and the trial court called the attorneys back to discuss the\n         appropriate response, which it then delivered to the jury. The bailiff notified the\n         court that the jury had reached a verdict shortly before 10 p.m. There is no\n         mention whatsoever of the second note regarding the 10-2 split in the jury, and\n         no explanation for its presence in the common law record. Accordingly, we\n         have difficulty in determining what weight, if any, should be placed on the\n         second note. Ordinarily, when the record is silent on a point, we must presume\n         that the trial court acted in conformity with the law. In re Estate of Cargola,\n         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2017 IL App (1st) 151823</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 17. A trial court generally must address on the\n         record any notes it receives from the jury. See People v. Childs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2226816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2226816/people-v-childs/\">159 Ill. 2d 217</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n         228-29 (1994). We presume that the trial court\u2019s failure to address the second\n         note on the record indicates that the jury ultimately chose not to send out the\n         second note. This presumption is buttressed by the fact that the trial court took\n         great pains to properly address the note it received about physical evidence.\u201d\n         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2226816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2226816/people-v-childs/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n     Finally, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s cumulative error argument. Id. \u00b6 64. The\n     court noted that, even if it viewed the admission of the letter as error, a petitioner\n     cannot argue cumulative error based on one error. Id.\n\n\u00b65       Petitioner then filed the pro se postconviction petition that is the subject of this\n     appeal. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In the body of the petition, petitioner\n     presents two claims for relief: an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a\n     proportionate penalties sentencing claim. The petition begins by explaining that\n     \u201c[t]he main claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Over the next two pages,\n\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f     petitioner details five specific ways in which he believed that trial counsel was\n     ineffective. On the next page, he argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for\n     failing to raise the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. He next alleges\n     that both trial and appellate counsel \u201cfell short when it comes to the investigation\n     done in this case.\u201d In the concluding paragraph of the ineffective assistance of\n     counsel portion of the petition, petitioner quotes Justice Black\u2019s dissent in Betts v.\n     Brady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103694\"><a href=\"/opinion/103694/betts-v-brady/\">316 U.S. 455</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 (1942) (Black, J., dissenting, joined by Douglas and\n     Murphy, JJ.), for the proposition that \u201c[w]hether a man is innocent cannot be\n     determined from a trial in which, as here, denial of counsel has made it impossible\n     to conclude, with any satisfactory degree of certainty, that the defendant\u2019s case was\n     adequately presented.\u201d In the next two sentences, he argues that he is entitled to a\n     new trial because he has met both prongs of the Strickland test. See Strickland v.\n     Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">466 U.S. 668</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The concluding sentence of this final paragraph\n     is: \u201cThe initial jury could not agree on a guilty verdict in this case, yet the Judge\n     told them they could not leave that night unless they all agreed on something, being\n     outnumbered and pressured they took the defendants [sic] freedom!\u201d\n\n\u00b66       On the next page of the petition, petitioner presents his proportionate penalties\n     claim. The claim is set forth in a paragraph titled \u201cConstitutional Violation.\u201d\n     Petitioner begins by noting that he was sentenced to a total of 50 years after a jury\n     verdict in which two jurors initially voted not guilty. Petitioner asserts that the judge\n     told the jurors that they should continue deliberating and that they could not leave\n     until they agree. Petitioner then says that this caused him to be sentenced to a\n     de facto life sentence and that the court failed to consider his rehabilitative\n     potential. Petitioner cites the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois\n     Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 11) and argues that he will likely not survive\n     his time in prison. Petitioner argued that the court imposing a sentence that will not\n     allow him to ever again be a productive citizen disregarded the central goal of our\n     penal system.\n\n\u00b67       The next two pages of the petition are petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Appointment of\n     Counsel.\u201d Petitioner explains that he is without sufficient funds to pay for the costs\n     of the proceedings or to hire an attorney, that he has a constitutional right to access\n     to the courts, and that his claims are not frivolous.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f\u00b68         Petitioner appended to the petition the affidavit of his sister, Roxanne Shaffer.\n       The affidavit is preceded by a page titled \u201cNewly Discovered Evidence.\u201d In a\n       paragraph, he explains the significance of Shaffer\u2019s affidavit:\n\n          \u201cOn July 25, 2019 Roxanne Shaffer made a Sworn Affidavit on behalf of the\n          defendant which is claiming a violation of the defendants [sic] right to due\n          process by forcing the jury to come to a unanimous verdict or they were not\n          allowed to leave that night despite a 10-2 verdict! Failure of trial counsel to\n          fully depose all witnesses also adds this to the claim for ineffective assistance\n          of trial counsel.\u201d\n\n\u00b69         In Shaffer\u2019s affidavit, she says that at approximately 9 p.m. on the date of her\n       brother\u2019s conviction, the jury sent a note saying that the verdict was 10 to 2.\n       According to Shaffer, the jurors asked if they could continue the next day, but the\n       judge denied the request, saying that he had a murder trial beginning the next day\n       and that he did not want to postpone it. Within half an hour to 45 minutes, the jury\n       came back with a guilty verdict. Shaffer said that she believed that this took away\n       petitioner\u2019s right to due process.\n\n\u00b6 10       On May 13, 2020, the trial court appointed attorney Eric Arnquist to represent\n       petitioner. The court explained that it was appointing counsel because the 90-day\n       time frame for entering an order on the petition had elapsed.\n\n\u00b6 11        On October 13, 2020, Arnquist filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for\n       petitioner. In the motion, Arnquist noted that the petition had not received a first\n       stage review by the trial court. Arnquist contended that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked\n       merit and that, pursuant to People v. Kuehner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812403/people-v-kuehner/\">2015 IL 117695</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, he would explain\n       why. Arnquist then went through petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of\n       trial and appellate counsel and explained why they lacked merit. He next explained\n       why petitioner\u2019s sentencing claim lacked merit. Arnquist concluded the motion\n       with a certificate pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Arnquist certified that he had consulted with petitioner to ascertain his contentions\n       of constitutional rights, had examined the record of proceedings from the trial, and\n       had made any amendments to the pro se petition that were necessary for an\n       adequate presentation of petitioner\u2019s contentions.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f\u00b6 12       At a hearing on the motion, Arnquist said that he reviewed his motion to\n       withdraw in detail with petitioner. Arnquist further explained that he had reviewed\n       the record on multiple occasions and had considered every page of it. He also\n       reviewed everything that petitioner had filed and all correspondence with\n       petitioner. He also reviewed the appellate court decision in the original appeal.\n       Arnquist said that petitioner had asked him to reach out to potential witnesses and\n       that he had done so. However, he was not able to make contact with everyone that\n       petitioner wanted him to. The court asked petitioner if he had reviewed the motion\n       to withdraw with Arnquist. Petitioner responded, \u201cYeah. I object to him\n       withdrawing.\u201d The court then granted the motion to withdraw, explaining that it\n       agreed with Arnquist\u2019s assessment of the issues.\n\n\u00b6 13       The State then asked for leave of court to file a motion to dismiss instanter. The\n       court granted the motion. In the motion, the State adopted the reasoning and\n       conclusions of Arnquist\u2019s motion to withdraw. At a hearing on the motion to\n       dismiss, the State stood on the motion. The court asked petitioner if he had anything\n       to argue in response to the State\u2019s motion. Petitioner responded that he had asked\n       Arnquist to make some phone calls and that Arnquist had not made them. The court\n       then asked petitioner if he had anything to argue in response to the motion to\n       dismiss. Petitioner responded, \u201cOther than the fact that my trial lawyer didn\u2019t do\n       everything he could to get me a not-guilty verdict. That\u2019s all I can argue with.\u201d The\n       court then asked petitioner if he had anything else to argue. Petitioner responded,\n       \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The court granted the motion to dismiss, stating that it agreed\n       with Arnquist\u2019s assessment that petitioner\u2019s claims lacked merit.\n\n\u00b6 14       Petitioner appealed, arguing that postconviction counsel did not provide\n       reasonable assistance under Rule 651(c) because his motion to withdraw failed to\n       address petitioner\u2019s due process claim concerning the jury note. Accordingly, he\n       contended that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing postconviction\n       counsel to withdraw. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 14. The appellate court agreed\n       with petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 15      The court noted that Rule 651(c) prescribes specific duties to ensure that\n       postconviction petitioners receive a reasonable level of assistance. Id. \u00b6 20. If, after\n       demonstrating compliance with Rule 651(c), counsel determines that the pro se\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       petition is frivolous or patently without merit, counsel may move to withdraw. Id.\n       \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 16       The court explained that its review of an order permitting withdrawal differs\n       based on how the petition arrived at the second stage. Id. \u00b6 23. If the petition\n       advanced to the second stage because the trial court found it potentially meritorious,\n       then the motion to withdraw must contain at least some explanation as to why all\n       of the claims set forth in the petition are so lacking in legal and factual support that\n       withdrawal is allowed. Id. (citing Kuehner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812403/people-v-kuehner/\">2015 IL 117695</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 27). If, however, the\n       petition advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, \u201c \u2018judicial\n       economy sometimes dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where\n       the motion to withdraw is deficient.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 24 (quoting People v.

The court noted that, in that situation, withdrawal may be\n       allowed if counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and the record demonstrates that the\n       claims in the pro se petition are frivolous or patently without merit. Id. \u00b6 26.\n       However, the court explained it had previously held in Moore that, even when the\n       petition advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, appointed\n       counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw must address the potential merit of all the petition\u2019s\n       claims. Id. \u00b6 27. In the court\u2019s view, the duty of counsel is the same no matter how\n       the petition advances to the second stage. The difference is that, when the petition\n       advances to the second stage based on trial court inaction, judicial economy may\n       sometimes warrant affirming the grant of a motion to withdraw even in the face of\n       a deficient motion. Id.\n\n\u00b6 17       The court explained that it held in Moore that, when the motion to withdraw\n       fails to address one of the pro se petitioner\u2019s claims, the case must be remanded\n       even when counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate.

The court explained that Moore stands for the proposition\n       that, if counsel does not address one of the pro se petition\u2019s claims in the motion to\n       withdraw, then counsel has not fulfilled his or her duty under Rule 651(c) to\n       ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 28.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f\u00b6 18        The court then held that the present case is governed by Moore. The court noted\n       that counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw did not mention \u201cthe claim based on the second\n       jury note or any of the circumstances surrounding the claim.\u201d Id. \u00b6 29. The court\n       rejected the State\u2019s argument that, when a petition advances to the second stage\n       based on trial court inaction, the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate is sufficient to\n       raise a presumption that counsel complied with the rule. Id. \u00b6 30. The court\n       explained that it would not \u201cpresume compliance when the record suggests\n       otherwise.\u201d Id. \u00b6 31. The court believed that the petition, liberally construed, set\n       forth a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id. \u00b6 32. The court rejected\n       the State\u2019s assertion that petitioner had forfeited the claim by not raising the issue\n       pro se at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Id. The court noted that the State had\n       failed to cite any authority for applying forfeiture in such a manner as to excuse an\n       attorney\u2019s lack of compliance with Rule 651(c). Id. Moreover, the court held that\n       petitioner\u2019s statement at the hearing that his counsel did not make requested phone\n       calls and did not \u201c \u2018do everything he could to get [defendant] a not-guilty verdict\u2019 \u201d\n       fairly encompassed a due process claim based on the second jury note. Id.\n       Accordingly, as it had done in Moore, the court vacated the orders allowing the\n       motion to withdraw and dismissing the petition and remanded the cause with\n       directions to appoint new postconviction counsel for petitioner. Id. \u00b6 34.\n\n\u00b6 19      This court allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct.

Because this petition\n       advanced to the second stage based on trial court inaction, the State argues that it\n       is governed by Greer. According to the State, the relevant inquiry under Greer is\n       whether (1) counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and (2) the petition\u2019s claims lack\n       merit. The State contends that counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and that a due\n       process claim based on the second jury note is frivolous and patently without merit.\n       Both the scope of an attorney\u2019s duties under Rule 651(c) and an attorney\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f       compliance with that rule are reviewed de novo.

Kuehner\n       establishes a rule of automatic reversal if the petition has advanced based on a trial\n       court finding that the claims are potentially meritorious but counsel fails to address\n       one of those claims in the motion to withdraw. Kuehner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812403/people-v-kuehner/\">2015 IL 117695</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6\u00b6 22-\n       24. In a case in which the petition has advanced based on trial court inaction, this\n       court has recognized that, in certain circumstances, reversal is not required. In\n       Greer, this court chose not to reverse when it appeared that counsel had fulfilled\n       his duties under Rule 651(c) and the record showed that the petition was frivolous\n       and without merit. Greer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094304/people-v-greer/\">212 Ill. 2d at 212</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In other words, as the appellate court\n       has recognized, Greer stands for the proposition that \u201cjudicial economy sometimes\n       dictates affirming the grant of leave to withdraw even where the motion to withdraw\n       is deficient.\u201d Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4322944\"><a href=\"/opinion/4545691/people-v-moore/\">2018 IL App (2d) 170120</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 38.\n\n\u00b6 29       In this case, the appellate court adopted an approach that largely collapsed the\n       above framework. Although the court acknowledged and accepted the difference\n       between Kuehner and Greer (</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26), it then\n       adopted a framework that would require automatic reversal whenever a claim is not\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw. The court determined that, liberally construed,\n       petitioner\u2019s petition contained a due process claim based on the second jury note.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f       Id. \u00b6 32. The court believed that postconviction counsel\u2019s failure to mention this\n       claim in the motion to withdraw necessarily meant that counsel had failed to\n       ascertain one of petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 29. Thus, because Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claims, counsel had violated Rule 651(c) by failing\n       to address this claim in the motion to withdraw. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The court\n       acknowledged that counsel had filed a Rule 651(c) certificate (id. \u00b6 10) but\n       impliedly determined that petitioner had rebutted the presumption of reasonable\n       assistance arising from the certificate (id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). And, because Rule 651(c)\n       violations are not subject to harmless error analysis (id. \u00b6 28), reversal and remand\n       for the appointment of new counsel were required (id. \u00b6 34). The framework\n       adopted by the appellate court necessarily means that anytime a postconviction\n       petitioner can identify a claim that the petition can be liberally construed to assert,\n       automatic reversal is required if the claim is not mentioned in counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw.\n\n\u00b6 30       The problem with the appellate court\u2019s position is that it is not always possible\n       to discern what claims a pro se postconviction petitioner is raising. That is why\n       Rule 651(c) ties the \u201cascertainment\u201d requirement to a consultation requirement.\n       The requirement under Rule 651(c) is not merely to ascertain the petitioner\u2019s\n       claims, as the appellate court stated. See id. \u00b6 27. Rather, Rule 651(c) requires\n       counsel to certify that he or she \u201cconsulted with petitioner by phone, mail,\n       electronic means or in person to ascertain his or her contentions of deprivation of\n       constitutional rights.\u201d (Emphases added.) Ill. S. Ct. R. 651(c) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n       Postconviction counsel certified that he did so, following which he filed a motion\n       to withdraw that addressed petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and\n       sentencing claims. Because counsel filed a Rule 651(c) certificate, a rebuttable\n       presumption of reasonable assistance arose. Addison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9388282\"><a href=\"/opinion/9392806/people-v-addison/\">2023 IL 127119</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 21.\n       Petitioner can overcome that presumption by showing that postconviction counsel\n       did not substantially comply with the strictures of the rule. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9388282\"><a href=\"/opinion/9392806/people-v-addison/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\u00b6 31       We hold that petitioner did not rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance.\n       Nothing in the record establishes that counsel failed to consult with petitioner to\n       ascertain his claims of a deprivation of constitutional rights. The appellate court\n       concluded that petitioner rebutted the presumption because the petition could be\n       liberally construed to assert a due process claim. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 210044-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 32.\n       However, the petition was, at best, ambiguous on that matter, and postconviction\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f       counsel certified that he consulted with petitioner to ascertain his claims. Following\n       that consultation, he filed a motion to withdraw addressing the petition\u2019s ineffective\n       assistance of counsel and sentencing claims. There is nothing in the record to show\n       that counsel did not consult with petitioner to ascertain his claims. No one but\n       petitioner and postconviction counsel knows what was said during those\n       consultations. If petitioner confirmed that the claims he intended to raise were\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties claim, the record\n       would look precisely as it does now. Postconviction counsel addressed the merits\n       of those issues in his motion to withdraw, and he told the court that he went over\n       the motion in detail with petitioner. The trial court asked petitioner if he had\n       anything to say in response. Petitioner stated that he objected to counsel\n       withdrawing, but he did not say that counsel had overlooked any of his claims. At\n       the hearing on the motion to dismiss the petition, petitioner argued that he asked\n       postconviction counsel to make some phone calls and that counsel did not do so.\n       He also argued that he did not believe that trial counsel did everything he could to\n       obtain a not-guilty verdict. He did not mention a due process claim or state that one\n       had been overlooked by counsel. In pointing this out we are not, as petitioner\n       argues, holding that he forfeited a claim by his silence or that we are shifting part\n       of the burden to him. We are simply acknowledging that there is nothing in the\n       record to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose from counsel\u2019s\n       Rule 651(c) certificate. Moreover, we disagree with the appellate court\u2019s assertion\n       that petitioner stating that counsel did not make all requested phone calls and that\n       trial counsel did not do everything he could to get petitioner a not-guilty verdict\n       \u201cfairly encompassed the due process claim.\u201d See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> We do not see how this can be\n       understood to be referencing counsel overlooking a due process claim based on the\n       second jury note.\n\n\u00b6 32        The most natural way to read the petition is that it raises substantive claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and a proportionate penalties sentencing claim.\n       The petition is divided into three sections: (1) the substantive claims, (2) the motion\n       for the appointment of counsel, and (3) the supporting documentation. Although\n       the jury note is mentioned in both sections of the substantive portion of the petition,\n       it is tied to petitioner\u2019s other claims. There is no due process claim asserted in the\n       substantive portion of the petition. The only time due process is mentioned is in the\n       supporting documentation. Petitioner\u2019s sister claimed in her affidavit that the trial\n       judge denied the jurors\u2019 request to continue their deliberations the next day and that\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f       she \u201cbelieve[d] this took away [petitioner\u2019s] right of due process.\u201d On the preceding\n       page, petitioner described the affidavit and explained why he was attaching it. He\n       explained that it adds to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b6 33       It seems clear that this is how appointed counsel read the petition. He filed a\n       certificate pursuant to Rule 651(c) in which he stated that he consulted with\n       petitioner to ascertain his deprivation of constitutional rights. Counsel\u2019s failure to\n       mention a due process claim based on the second jury note strongly suggests that,\n       after consulting with petitioner, counsel reasonably ascertained that petitioner was\n       not asserting a standalone due process claim based on the second jury note. There\n       is no question that his intent was to address all of petitioner\u2019s claims in his motion\n       to withdraw. He stated in the motion that it was being filed pursuant to this court\u2019s\n       holding in Kuehner and that his obligation was to explain why all of the petition\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. In Kuehner, we held that postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw was required to address claims that were \u201cspecific, substantial, and\n       sufficiently present in the petition to warrant appointed counsel\u2019s attention.\u201d\n       Kuehner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812403/people-v-kuehner/\">2015 IL 117695</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 23. Counsel did so by addressing the claims of\n       ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing error.\n\n\u00b6 34        Petitioner relies on Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4322944\"><a href=\"/opinion/4545691/people-v-moore/\">2018 IL App (2d) 170120</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which the appellate\n       court held that the petitioner had failed to comply with Rule 651(c) when counsel\n       filed a motion to withdraw that omitted one of the petitioner\u2019s claims. The case had\n       proceeded to stage two when the trial court failed to rule on the petition within 90\n       days. The court held that counsel had failed to ascertain petitioner\u2019s claim that\n       appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge amendments to the\n       indictment. Id. \u00b6 41. The court acknowledged the pro se petition\u2019s \u201clength and\n       density\u201d but stated that it could not excuse compliance with Rule 651(c)\u2019s mandate\n       that counsel ascertain the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id. \u00b6 42. The State argues that Moore\n       was incorrectly decided because (1) it decoupled the ascertainment requirement\n       from the consultation requirement and (2) the court failed to acknowledge\u2014let\n       alone apply\u2014the presumption that arises from the filing of a Rule 651(c) certificate.\n       For purposes of this appeal, we do not need to address the correctness of Moore, as\n       it is clearly distinguishable. In Moore, there was an omitted claim that was clearly\n       stated in the petition. See id. \u00b6 24. Because we are not faced with that situation, we\n       have no need to weigh in on the correctness of that decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f\u00b6 35        Petitioner has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance that arose\n       from counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We note that, in addition to arguing that\n       postconviction counsel complied with Rule 651(c), the State also argues that any\n       due process claim based on the second jury note would lack merit. Because this\n       case arose from a situation in which the petition proceeded to stage two because of\n       trial court inaction, the State contends that Greer applies and that the relevant\n       inquiry is whether counsel complied with Rule 651(c) and whether petitioner\u2019s\n       claims lack merit. As explained above, however, regardless of how the petition\n       arrives at the second stage, a proper motion to withdraw should explain why the\n       petition\u2019s claims lack merit. The separate Greer standard comes into play only\n       when the court is faced with a deficient motion to withdraw. That is not the situation\n       here. Petitioner has not established that the motion to withdraw was deficient.\n       Because petitioner failed to rebut the presumption that arose from counsel\u2019s Rule\n       651(c) certificate, we presume that the petitioner\u2019s claims are the ones counsel\n       addressed in the motion to withdraw, and petitioner has not challenged either\n       postconviction counsel\u2019s or the trial court\u2019s assessment of the merits of those\n       claims.\n\n\n\u00b6 36                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 37      Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of reasonable assistance arising from\n       counsel\u2019s Rule 651(c) certificate. We therefore reverse the appellate court\u2019s\n       judgment. We affirm the trial court\u2019s orders allowing postconviction counsel to\n       withdraw and dismissing petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 38      Appellate court judgment reversed.\n\n\u00b6 39      Circuit court judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/103694/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111170/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2036059/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2048212/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2094304/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2213448/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2226816/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2812403/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4322944/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4648571/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9388282/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9402111/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925364/", "id": 9925364, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467526/state-ex-rel-raoul-v-elite-staffing-inc/", "cluster_id": 9467526, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467526/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T08:03:52.462763-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T08:51:40.007302-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "7727648529c96c3677d570a0bb666119d04dcce6", "page_count": 20, "download_url": "https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/resources/b5963ea3-c412-4137-a5b2-68058c5cc639/file", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/state_ex_rel._raoul_v._elite_staffing_inc..pdf", "plain_text": "                                       2024 IL 128763\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 128763)\n\n     THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ex rel.

(collectively, the staffing agencies),\n      violated the Illinois Antitrust Act. 740 ILCS 10/3 (West 2018). The staffing\n      agencies filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the act did not apply\n\f     to the charged conduct. The circuit court of Cook County denied the motion but\n     certified for interlocutory review two questions about the reach of the act:\n\n            \u201c1. Whether the definition of \u2018Service\u2019 under Section 4 of the Illinois\n        Antitrust Act, 740 ILCS 10/4, which states that Service \u2018shall not be deemed to\n        include labor which is performed by natural persons as employees of others,\u2019\n        applies to the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole and thus excludes all labor\n        services from the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s coverage.\n\n            2. Whether the per se rule under Section 3(1) of the Illinois Antitrust Act,\n        740 ILCS 10/3(1), which states that it applies to conspiracies among\n        \u2018competitor[s],\u2019 extends to alleged horizontal agreements facilitated by a\n        vertical noncompetitor.\u201d\n\n     The appellate court answered the second question, but instead of answering\n     question 1, it answered a different question:\n\n        \u201cwhether the exclusion of individual labor from the definition of \u2018service\u2019 in\n        section 4 of the [Illinois Antitrust Act] also excludes the labor-related services\n        provided by temporary staffing agencies and therefore exempts such agencies\n        from [its] coverage.\u201d 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b62      We granted the staffing agencies\u2019 petition for leave to appeal from the appellate\n     court decision.

We vacate the appellate court\u2019s answer to the\n     question it formulated, answer the circuit court\u2019s first certified question, do not\n     address the second certified question because the parties have not sought our review\n     of that question and its answer, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\u00b64                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b65       The State alleged in its complaint that Colony Display (Colony) hired the\n     staffing agencies to supply the temporary workers it needed. Colony, which installs\n     fixtures and displays for home improvement and retail businesses, relies heavily on\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f     temporary workers, who form the majority of Colony\u2019s workforce. 2022 IL App\n     (1st) 210840, \u00b6 3. At Colony\u2019s request, the State alleged, the staffing agencies\n     agreed to fix the wages for their employees who worked for Colony at below-\n     market rates, and they agreed not to hire each other\u2019s employees. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Colony\n     helped the staffing agencies enforce their agreement. Id. The State claimed the\n     alleged conduct constituted an agreement between competitors to fix the price paid\n     for services and therefore that it had violated section 3(1)(a) of the Illinois Antitrust\n     Act (740 ILCS 10/3(1) (West 2018)). 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 12. The\n     defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under section 2-615 of the Code\n     of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2018)), claiming that the complaint\n     did not state a cause of action because the Illinois Antitrust Act provides that\n     services otherwise subject to the act \u201cshall not be deemed to include labor which is\n     performed by natural persons as employees of others\u201d (740 ILCS 10/4 (West\n     2018)). 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 7.\n\n\u00b66       The circuit court denied the motion but certified for interlocutory review the\n     following issue:\n\n         \u201c \u2018Whether the definition of \u201cService\u201d under Section 4 of the Illinois Antitrust\n         Act, 740 ILCS 10/4, which states that Service \u201cshall not be deemed to include\n         labor which is performed by natural persons as employees of others,\u201d applies to\n         the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole and thus excludes all labor services from\n         the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s coverage.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b67      The parties have not asked this court to address in this appeal the second\n     question the circuit court certified for interlocutory review.

Appellate Court\n\n\u00b69        The appellate court found first that the question as phrased relied on an incorrect\n     assumption that, if the definition of \u201cservice\u201d applied to the Illinois Antitrust Act\n     as a whole, it exempts all labor services from the act\u2019s coverage. Id. \u00b6 11. The\n     appellate court restated the question and addressed instead the issue of \u201cwhether\n     the exclusion of individual labor from the definition of \u2018service\u2019 in section 4 of the\n     [Illinois Antitrust Act] also excludes the labor-related services provided by\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       temporary staffing agencies and therefore exempts such agencies from [its]\n       coverage.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 10       The appellate court found that the legislature narrowed the definition of service\n       \u201cto allow individuals to engage in otherwise anticompetitive behavior regarding\n       their own labor by participating in collective bargaining and related conduct.\u201d Id.\n       \u00b6 15. The appellate court found the exemption of section 4 did not extend to services\n       provided by staffing agencies. The court held:\n\n           \u201c[T]o the extent that the alleged unlawful conduct concerns restraints that they\n           place on their own services (i.e., recruiting, hiring, and managing temporary\n           employees) and do not concern restraints on a natural person\u2019s individual labor,\n           temporary staffing agencies like the Agency Defendants in this case are subject\n           to the Act\u2019s provisions and, in particular, section 3\u2019s prohibitions on\n           anticompetitive restraints on services.\u201d Id. \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 11        This court granted the agencies\u2019 petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a)\n       (eff. Oct. 1, 2021). We accepted briefs amici curiae from (1) the United States\n       Department of Justice in support of the State\u2019s position; (2) Raise the Floor\n       Alliance, National Legal Advocacy Network, and National Employment Law\n       Project in support of the State\u2019s position; and (3) Staffing Services Association of\n       Illinois and American Staffing Association in support of the staffing agencies\u2019\n       position. Ill. S. Ct. R. 345 (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 12                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13       Rule 315 gives this court jurisdiction over the appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff.\n       Oct. 1, 2021); Moore v. Chicago Park District, 2012 IL 112788, \u00b6 7. Illinois courts\n       usually limit review under Rule 308 (Ill. S. Ct. R. 308 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019)) to\n       answering the certified question, unless the question rests on an erroneous legal\n       assumption. De Bouse v. Bayer AG, 235 Ill. 2d 544, 550, 557 (2009).\n\n\u00b6 14       Both parties ask this court to answer the question certified by the circuit court\n       rather than the question the appellate court answered. We do not interpret the circuit\n       court\u2019s question as incorrectly assuming that, if the definition of service applies to\n       the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole, the act necessarily excludes all labor services\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f       from its coverage. Rather, we find that the question the circuit court certified asked\n       the appellate court to decide whether the Illinois Antitrust Act excludes from its\n       coverage all agreements concerning labor services. We will answer the circuit\n       court\u2019s certified question.\n\n\u00b6 15       On certified question review, this court should address only issues of law and\n       not the application of the law to the particular facts of the case. Rozsavolgyi v. City\n       of Aurora, 2017 IL 121048, \u00b6 21. We review de novo rulings on the interpretation\n       of a statute. Midwest Sanitary Service, Inc. v. Sandberg, Phoenix & Von Gontard,\n       P.C., 2022 IL 127327, \u00b6 19.\n\n\u00b6 16       We apply familiar principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe most fundamental\n       rule in statutory construction is to give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d Murray v.\n       Chicago Youth Center, 224 Ill. 2d 213, 235 (2007). \u201cThe statutory language, given\n       its plain and ordinary meaning, is generally the most reliable indicator of that\n       legislative intent, but a literal reading must fail if it yields absurd, inconvenient, or\n       unjust results.\u201d Cassidy v. China Vitamins, LLC, 2018 IL 122873, \u00b6 17.\n\n           \u201cWords and phrases should not be considered in isolation; rather, they must be\n           interpreted in light of other relevant provisions and the statute as a whole.\n           [Citations.] In addition to the statutory language, the court may consider the\n           purpose behind the law and the evils sought to be remedied, as well as the\n           consequences that would result from construing the law one way or the other.\u201d\n           County of Du Page v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 231 Ill. 2d 593, 604\n           (2008).\n\n\n\u00b6 17                                  A. The Statutes at Issue\n\n\u00b6 18      We must interpret five sections of the Illinois Antitrust Act: sections 2, 3, 4, 5,\n       and 11 (740 ILCS 10/2, 3, 4, 5, 11 (West 2018)). Section 2 states that the legislature\n       adopted the act\n\n           \u201cto promote the unhampered growth of commerce and industry throughout the\n           State by prohibiting restraints of trade which are secured through monopolistic\n           or oligarchic practices and which act or tend to act to decrease competition\n           between and among persons engaged in commerce and trade, whether in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f       manufacturing, distribution, financing, and service industries or in related for-\n       profit pursuits.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 19   Section 3 provides:\n\n       \u201cEvery person shall be deemed to have committed a violation of this Act who\n       shall:\n\n             (1) Make any contract with, or engage in any combination or conspiracy\n          with, any other person who is, or but for a prior agreement would be, a\n          competitor of such person:\n\n              a. for the purpose or with the effect of fixing, controlling, or maintaining\n          the *** fee charged or paid for any service performed or received by the\n          parties thereto; [or]\n\n              b. fixing, controlling, maintaining, [or] limiting *** the sale or supply\n          of any service, for the purpose or with the effect stated in paragraph a. of\n          subsection (1)[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 3.\n\n\u00b6 20   Section 4 defines \u201cservice\u201d as follows:\n\n           \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 shall mean any activity, not covered by the definition of\n       \u2018commodity,\u2019 which is performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial\n       gain.\n           \u2018Service\u2019 shall not be deemed to include labor which is performed by natural\n       persons as employees of others.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4.\n\n\u00b6 21   Section 5 makes an exception to the broad reach of section 3:\n\n       \u201cNo provisions of this Act shall be construed to make illegal:\n\n              (1) the activities of any labor organization or of individual members\n          thereof which are directed solely to labor objectives which are legitimate\n          under the laws of either the State of Illinois or the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5.\n\n\u00b6 22   Section 11 guides the interpretation of the Illinois Antitrust Act:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f          \u201cWhen the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of a federal antitrust\n          law, the courts of this State shall use the construction of the federal law by the\n          federal courts as a guide in construing this Act.\u201d Id. \u00a7 11.\n\n\u00b6 23       This court has explained that, where the language of federal antitrust statutes\n       differs markedly from the Illinois Antitrust Act, \u201cwe must consider whether, given\n       the differences between section 3[ ] and [the federal statute], the reasoning\n       employed by the Federal courts in interpreting [the federal statute] is relevant to\n       our interpretation of section 3[ ].\u201d Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen Gallery v. Ethan Allen,\n       Inc., 162 Ill. 2d 99, 104 (1994).\n\n\u00b6 24       Because of section 11, we must also consult federal antitrust statutes. Section 1\n       of the Sherman Act provides that \u201c[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust\n       or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several\n       States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (2018).\n\n\u00b6 25      Finally, the Clayton Act provides:\n\n              \u201cThe labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.\n          Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence\n          and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for\n          the purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for\n          profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from\n          lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such\n          organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal\n          combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws.\u201d Id.\n          \u00a7 17.\n\n\n\u00b6 26                        B. Section 3 of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n\n\u00b6 27        The General Assembly patterned section 3(1)(a) of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       after section 1 of the Sherman Act. People ex rel. Scott v. College Hills Corp., 91\n       Ill. 2d 138, 150 (1982) (\u201cSection 3(1)(a) is patterned after section 1 of the Sherman\n       Act [citation], and in our construction of the Illinois Antitrust Act we are guided by\n       Federal case law construing analogous provisions of Federal legislation\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       [citation].\u201d). The United States Supreme Court succinctly summarized one\n       significant problem courts encounter when interpreting the Sherman Act:\n\n          \u201c[Section] 1 of the Sherman Act *** cannot mean what it says. The statute says\n          that \u2018every\u2019 contract that restrains trade is unlawful. But, as Mr. Justice Brandeis\n          perceptively noted, restraint is the very essence of every contract; read literally,\n          [section] 1 would outlaw the entire body of private contract law.\u201d National\n          Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-88\n          (1978).\n\n       To avoid the absurd consequences of applying the Sherman Act literally, \u201c \u2018courts\n       have construed it as precluding only those contracts or combinations which\n       \u201cunreasonably\u201d restrain competition.\u2019 \u201d Williams v. St. Joseph Hospital, 629 F.2d\n       448, 452 (7th Cir. 1980) (quoting Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356\n       U.S. 1, 5 (1958)). For many restraints of trade, federal courts adopted \u201crule of\n       reason\u201d analysis, under which the \u201ctrial court must perform a market share analysis\n       to determine whether the defendant possessed monopoly power in the relevant\n       market. *** [T]he plaintiff must show that the defendant possessed sufficient\n       monopoly power to inflict competitive injury in the relevant market.\u201d Gilbert\u2019s\n       Ethan Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 102-03.\n\n\u00b6 28       Some agreements \u201care so plainly anticompetitive [citation] that they are\n       conclusively presumed illegal without further examination under the rule of reason\n       generally applied in Sherman Act cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n       Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 8 (1979).\n       \u201c \u2018If a practice is within the per se category, all you have to prove to establish a\n       violation is that the defendant engaged in the practice; you do not have to show that\n       in fact the practice has had or will have an adverse effect on competition.\u2019 \u201d\n       Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 105 (quoting Marrese v. American\n       Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 692 F.2d 1083, 1093 (7th Cir. 1982).\n       \u201c[A]greements among competitors to fix prices on their individual goods or\n       services are among those concerted activities that the Court has held to be within\n       the per se category.\u201d Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. at 8.\n\n\u00b6 29       The complaint here alleges that competitors, the staffing agencies, agreed to fix\n       the wages they would pay to their employees sent to work for Colony. The alleged\n       agreement falls squarely within the realm of conduct so clearly anticompetitive that\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f       it violates antitrust laws without further examination under the rule of reason. See\n       id.; Quinonez v. National Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, Inc., 540 F.2d 824, 828-29\n       (5th Cir. 1976).\n\n\u00b6 30       Applying federal standards (see Laughlin v. Evanston Hospital, 133 Ill. 2d 374,\n       383-84 (1990)), we find that a multiemployer agreement to restrict wages and not\n       to hire each other\u2019s employees violates section 3 of the Illinois Antitrust Act unless\n       section 4 of the act exempts the alleged agreement from the coverage of the act.\n\n\n\u00b6 31                         C. Section 4 of the Illinois Antitrust Act\n\n\u00b6 32       Considered in isolation, section 4, which exempts from the Illinois Antitrust\n       Act\u2019s coverage \u201clabor which is performed by natural persons as employees of\n       others\u201d (740 ILCS 10/4 (West 2018)), appears to exempt from antitrust scrutiny all\n       agreements concerning wages and conditions of employment, regardless of their\n       anticompetitive effects. But if we construe the definition so broadly, it conflicts\n       with the stated purpose of the act, which the legislature designed\n\n          \u201cto promote the unhampered growth of commerce and industry throughout the\n          State by prohibiting restraints of trade which are secured through monopolistic\n          or oligarchic practices and which act or tend to act to decrease competition\n          between and among persons engaged in commerce and trade, whether in\n          manufacturing, distribution, financing, and service industries or in related for-\n          profit pursuits.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 33       Just as the broad language of the Sherman Act conflicted with its purpose and\n       led to absurd results, the broad language of the definition in section 4 conflicts with\n       the purpose of the Illinois Antitrust Act. We find section 4\u2019s definition of services,\n       when considered in the context of the act as a whole, ambiguous because of the\n       conflict between the apparent reach of the exemption on superficial examination\n       and the purpose of the act. When we encounter ambiguity in a statute considered as\n       a whole, we turn to tools of interpretation to help us determine the meaning of a\n       statute. DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006) (\u201cif the language of a statute\n       is ambiguous, courts may look to tools of interpretation to ascertain the meaning of\n       a provision\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f\u00b6 34      \u201cWhere the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every\n       thing from which aid can be derived.\u201d United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch)\n       358, 386 (1805). \u201cWhen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the\n       statute, is available, there certainly can be no rule of law which forbids its use,\n       however clear the words may appear on superficial examination.\u201d (Internal\n       quotation marks omitted.) United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S.\n       534, 543-44 (1940).\n\n\u00b6 35        We have a commentary on the Illinois Antitrust Act prepared by the drafters,\n       the Chicago Bar Association\u2019s Committee on Antitrust Law (Committee). The\n       Committee prepared the commentary in 1967, two years after the legislature\n       enacted the Illinois Antitrust Act. This court has used the commentary as an aid to\n       interpreting the act. See Laughlin, 133 Ill. 2d at 386-87; Gilbert\u2019s Ethan Allen\n       Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 106. State archives list the sponsors of the bill that became\n       the Illinois Antitrust Act and the proponents and opponents of the bill. One of the\n       bill\u2019s proponents, Professor James Rahl, wrote an article in which he argued the\n       states should enact their own antitrust statutes because not all pernicious price\n       fixing agreements and other antitrust violations affect interstate commerce. James\n       A. Rahl, Toward a Worthwhile State Antitrust Policy, 39 Tex. L. Rev. 753, 758\n       (1961) (State Antitrust). Because Rahl appeared before the legislature as a\n       proponent of the bill the legislature enacted, we find that his article qualifies as\n       some evidence concerning the intent of the legislation. William N. Eskridge Jr., The\n       New Textualism, 37 UCLA L. Rev. 621, 636 (1990) (comments of nonlegislator\n       drafters constitute some evidence of legislative intent). We also have some\n       evidence of legislative inaction and an argument concerning the effect of\n       subsequent legislation.\n\n\u00b6 36       Because section 11 of the Illinois Antitrust Act directs our attention to federal\n       law, we start with a discussion of decisions interpreting federal antitrust law,\n       followed by discussions of the committee comments, Rahl\u2019s views, and legislative\n       inaction. Finally, we respond to an argument raised by amici supporting the staffing\n       agencies\u2019 position, who claim that a statute immunizes staffing agencies from all\n       antitrust laws.\n\n\n\u00b6 37                                1. Federal Antitrust Law\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\f\u00b6 38       The Clayton Act provides, \u201cThe labor of a human being is not a commodity or\n       article of commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 (2018). Employers have sought to use the\n       provision to exempt from antitrust scrutiny anticompetitive agreements similar to\n       the agreement alleged in the State\u2019s complaint here.\n\n\u00b6 39       In Roman v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 55 F.3d 542, 543 (10th Cir. 1995), Roman\n       alleged that several airplane manufacturers agreed not to hire each other\u2019s\n       employees. He alleged that one of the manufacturers would have hired him and\n       paid him a higher salary if not for the agreement. Id. The Roman court found that\n       Roman stated a cause of action for violation of federal antitrust law. Id. at 545. The\n       court adopted the following explanation from a treatise on antitrust law:\n\n              \u201c \u2018Antitrust law addresses employer conspiracies controlling employment\n          terms precisely because they tamper with the employment market and thereby\n          impair the opportunities of those who sell their services there. Just as antitrust\n          law seeks to preserve the free market opportunities of buyers and sellers of\n          goods, so also it seeks to do the same for buyers and sellers of employment\n          services. ***\n\n              Thus, the courts have readily approved standing for professional athletes\n          challenging agreements among employers fixing employment terms and for\n          brokers or magazine solicitors challenging their employers\u2019 agreements against\n          hiring switching employees.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 544 (quoting II Phillip Areeda & Herbert\n          Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law \u00b6 377c (rev. ed. 1995)).\n\n\u00b6 40       Both parties cite Cordova v. Bache & Co., 321 F. Supp. 600 (S.D.N.Y. 1970),\n       in support of their arguments. In Cordova, securities representatives alleged that\n       their employers, stock brokerage firms, conspired to reduce the commissions paid\n       to securities representatives for the sale of stock. Id. at 603. The brokerage firms,\n       like the staffing agencies here, argued that the complaint did not allege a violation\n       of antitrust law. Id. at 605. According to the brokerage firms, a \u201cconspiracy on the\n       part of employers with respect to the labor of their employees\u201d cannot violate\n       federal antitrust law because \u201c \u2018[t]he labor of a human being is not a commodity or\n       article of commerce.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 (1970)).\n\n\u00b6 41      The Cordova court held:\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f              \u201cIf the language of *** the Clayton Act stopped with the sentence quoted\n          by defendants, it would lend support to their position. It is immediately\n          followed, however, by additional language which when considered in the light\n          of the statute\u2019s legislative history, convinces us that the sole purpose and effect\n          of the section is to exempt activities and agreements on the part of labor,\n          agricultural or horticultural organizations with respect to their furnishing labor\n          in the market place. ***\n\n                                              ***\n\n              It is readily apparent that Congress *** was concerned with the right of\n          labor and similar organizations to continue engaging in such activities,\n          including that right to strike, not with the right of employers to ban[d] together\n          for joint action in fixing the wages to be paid by each employer. There is no\n          evidence of the existence of any necessity to protect the latter type of activity\n          ***.\u201d Id. at 605-06.\n\n\u00b6 42       The court surveyed the extensive legislative history of the federal antitrust\n       statutes and concluded:\n\n          \u201cCongress\u2019 only purpose *** was to help the labor organizations and the labor\n          movement by removing any doubt as to the legality of their existence and\n          operations. ***\n\n              ***\n\n              There can be little doubt about the fact that if a group of employers, as the\n          complaint here alleges, were allowed, not as part of a collective bargaining\n          agreement, to agree together to reduce the commissions paid to their respective\n          employees, they would have the same power to restrain competition as is\n          inherent in a price-fixing agreement. *** The effect of such a unilateral\n          agreement between employers, as alleged in the present complaint (citation),\n          could also be to restrain mobility on the part of employees who would otherwise\n          have the opportunity, in a competitive market for services, to transfer to higher\n          paid opportunities offered by other[s]. *** [A]n agreement between employers\n          would enable the employers together to achieve what no single one of them\n          could do alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f                                                ***\n\n               *** [A]n essential prerequisite to the legality of such multiemployer\n           combinations with respect to industry-wide wages or working conditions is the\n           existence or prospect of a joint collective bargaining agreement with the union,\n           which all parties concede to be immune from the antitrust laws. The exemption\n           granted to such agreements extends to joint-employer action reasonably related\n           or incident to them. Absent such conditions, however, a combination of\n           employers to reduce their employees\u2019 compensation does not share labor\u2019s\n           exemption.\u201d Id. at 606-07.\n\n\n\u00b6 43                               2. Bar Committee Comments\n\n\u00b6 44        The bar commentary explains that the Illinois Antitrust Act, \u201c[i]n the main, ***\n       is the same as a bill drafted by the Committee on Antitrust Law of the Chicago Bar\n       Association.\u201d 740 ILCS Ann. art. 10, Committee Comments-1967, at 12 (Smith-\n       Hurd 2010). The committee prepared the commentary \u201cto memorialize the\n       intentions of the draftsmen as to the meaning of the language of the Act, and to\n       offer guidance to the courts and the bar in the interpretation of the law.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 45       The commentary first explains the need for \u201ceffective antitrust enforcement at\n       the state level\u201d (id. at 13) and adds that the drafters intended \u201cto provide an effective\n       means of combating the serious damage which is done to the free enterprise system\n       in Illinois by groups who substitute self-designed schemes of private business\n       regulation for the impersonal direction of the free market\u201d (id. at 14). According to\n       the commentary, section 3(1)(a)\n\n           \u201cis designed to reach the \u2018hard core\u2019 conspiratorial offenses of price fixing,\n           limitations on production, and allocation of markets or customers. ***\n\n               Section 3(1)(a) proscribes agreements between competitors, the purpose or\n           effect of which is to fix, control, or maintain *** the prices which they will pay\n           for the commodities or services which they buy.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3, Committee\n           Comments-1967, at 19-20.\n\n\u00b6 46       The brief commentary on section 4 addresses the definition of service:\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f          \u201c[T]he definitions of Section 4 were expressly designed to make services and\n          real estate subject to the prohibitions of the law. It was the feeling of the\n          draftsmen that exemptions should be strictly limited and that almost all service\n          occupations should be within the reach of the statute. In this connection see the\n          discussion, infra, with relation to Section 5 on exemptions generally.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4,\n          Committee Comments-1967, at 52.\n\n\u00b6 47      The comment on section 5 elaborates:\n\n             \u201cIt was always understood by the draftsmen that exemptions would be\n          accorded to labor unions, agricultural cooperatives, and public utilities. *** [I]t\n          was believed necessary to adopt an approach similar to that used for the federal\n          exemptions on those subjects, thereby preserving general overall consistency.\n\n              The labor exemption in subsection (1), like that of *** the Clayton Act,\n          prevents the application of the Antitrust Act to legitimate labor objectives and\n          activities of unions or of individual members thereof. The Illinois Act is more\n          explicit than the Clayton Act, however, in limiting the exemption to activities\n          which \u2018are directed solely to labor objectives which are legitimate under the\n          laws of either the State of Illinois or the United States.\u2019 ***.\n\n              The labor exemption should be read together with the provision of Section\n          4 which states that labor performed as an employee is not a \u2018service\u2019 within the\n          meaning of Section 3 of the Act. The effect of this provision is to make the Act\n          inapplicable to agreements by either labor or nonlabor groups insofar as they\n          relate to restraint of competition concerning labor itself. The Act thus protects\n          both management and labor in bargaining collectively over terms and\n          conditions of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5, Committee Comments-1967, at 55.\n\n\u00b6 48       We find the bar committee commentary shows the drafters intended to limit the\n       exemption to legitimate labor union activity and agreements multiple employers\n       reach in the course of collective negotiations with labor unions.\n\n\n\u00b6 49                                    3. Rahl\u2019s Proposal\n\n\u00b6 50       In State Antitrust, Rahl proposed an antitrust act, and the proposal included the\n       following definition:\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 14 -\n\f              \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 shall mean any activity not covered by the definition of\n          commodity, which is performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial\n          gain. \u2018Service\u2019 shall not include labor which is performed by persons as\n          employees of others, but this exclusion is limited to conduct pertaining to such\n          labor, and does not exclude from the operation of this Act agreements or acts\n          by or with laborers or organizations of laborers concerning commodities and\n          services covered by this Act.\u201d Rahl, supra, at 775.\n\n\u00b6 51      Rahl explained:\n\n          \u201cThe draft *** [makes an] exclusion for labor in the definition of \u2018services.\u2019\n          *** [The exclusion] should be sufficient to protect the right of labor\n          organizations to restrain and monopolize the terms and supply of the labor with\n          which they are concerned, and hence to carry on the customary labor activities\n          contemplated by present-day national labor policy. Incidentally, this approach\n          would also remove from the act restraints as to labor imposed by non-labor\n          groups, occurring in situations such as joint bargaining on the management\n          side.\u201d Id. at 778.\n\n\u00b6 52       Like the bar committee, Rahl emphasizes the need to exempt legitimate union\n       activity from the reach of the Illinois Antitrust Act and the correlative exemption\n       for agreements between employers in the course of negotiations with unions. No\n       source concerning the purpose of antitrust laws suggests that the legislature meant\n       to leave competing employers free to collude with each other to reduce the wages\n       they pay to their employees or to collude to prevent workers from switching to\n       better jobs.\n\n\n\u00b6 53                                 4. Legislative Inaction\n\n\u00b6 54       The staffing agencies rely on two published federal cases and argue that the\n       legislature\u2019s failure to amend the Illinois Antitrust Act after those decisions shows\n       that the two decisions correctly interpreted Illinois law.\n\n\u00b6 55       \u201cWhere the legislature chooses not to amend a statute after a judicial\n       construction, it will be presumed that it has acquiesced in the court\u2019s statement of\n       the legislative intent.\u201d Miller v. Lockett, 98 Ill. 2d 478, 483 (1983).\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f          \u201c[E]vidence of legislative silence and subsequent history is usually too\n          ambiguous to count as legislative history, but in some contexts the sources are\n          considered by the [United States Supreme] Court. *** Legislative silence will\n          usually be supporting evidence of legislative intent and will be the main\n          evidence only when there is virtually no other evidence of legislative intent.\u201d\n          Eskridge, supra, at 640.\n\n\u00b6 56       We find that the persuasive power of legislative silence depends on the\n       circumstances of the legislative decision not to amend a statute following a judicial\n       interpretation of the statute.\n\n              \u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that where, after a statute has been\n          construed by the highest court of the state, the Legislature re-enacts the statute,\n          whether by the adoption of Revised Statutes or by amendment, the act of the\n          Legislature carries with it the construction previously placed upon the law by\n          the court.\u201d Texas Fidelity & Bonding Co. v. City of Austin, 246 S.W. 1026, 1029\n          (Tex. 1922).\n\n       Similarly, \u201c[a]fter [the Illinois Supreme Court] has construed a statute, \u2018that\n       construction becomes, in effect, a part of the statute and any change in interpretation\n       can be effected by the General Assembly if it desires so to do.\u2019 \u201d Village of Vernon\n       Hills v. Heelan, 2015 IL 118170, \u00b6 19 (quoting Mitchell v. Mahin, 51 Ill. 2d 452,\n       456 (1972)).\n\n\u00b6 57       Legislative inaction following an interpretation by the Illinois Appellate Court\n       provides some lesser support for an inference the appellate court correctly\n       interpreted the statute. Barrall v. Board of Trustees of John A. Logan Community\n       College, 2020 IL 125535, \u00b6 27 n.2. The inference disappears if published opinions\n       of the appellate court give differing interpretations of the statute. See United States\n       v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 55 n.13 (1964) (no inference arises if published decisions\n       show no settled judicial interpretation of the statute).\n\n\u00b6 58        Here, the staffing agencies rely on two published federal decisions interpreting\n       Illinois law. Because the federal decisions do not bind Illinois courts (Travelers\n       Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 278, 302 (2001) (\u201c \u2018The\n       general rule is that decisions of the United States district and circuit courts are not\n       binding on Illinois courts.\u2019 \u201d (quoting City of Chicago v. Groffman, 68 Ill. 2d 112,\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f       118 (1977)))), we find the proposed inference from legislative inaction very weak,\n       but we consider it as some evidence of legislative intent. See Wittman v. Koenig,\n       831 F.3d 416, 425 (7th Cir. 2016) (\u201cIt is difficult to imagine careful drafting of\n       legislation in this field that would not consider decisions by the federal bankruptcy\n       courts in the state. In this situation, then, it is reasonable to treat legislative silence\n       as at least weak evidence that the bankruptcy courts\u2019 interpretation of Wisconsin\n       Statutes \u00a7 815.18(3)(j) has not been objectionable to the legislature.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 59       In O\u2019Regan v. Arbitration Forums, Inc., 121 F.3d 1060, 1062-63 (7th Cir.\n       1997), O\u2019Regan sued her former employer, a nonprofit corporation, alleging that\n       the employer violated both federal and Illinois antitrust law by terminating her\n       employment because she refused to sign a noncompete agreement. The O\u2019Regan\n       court found O\u2019Regan had not stated a claim for a federal violation because \u201can\n       employee discharged for refusing to participate in an alleged antitrust violation has\n       no standing to sue on the basis of that violation.\u201d Id. at 1065.\n\n\u00b6 60       The court then found three separate reasons for dismissing the state claims:\n\n           \u201cFederal antitrust standing rules apply under the Illinois Antitrust Act. *** The\n           Act only covers services \u2018performed in whole or in part for the purposes of\n           financial gain.\u2019 [Citation.] *** [The defendant] is a non-profit corporation, not\n           covered by the Illinois Antitrust Act. Finally, to the extent O\u2019Regan\u2019s claims\n           relate to an alleged market for labor services, they are specifically excluded by\n           \u00a7 10/4 of the Act ***.\u201d Id. at 1066.\n\n\u00b6 61       The O\u2019Regan court read one sentence from section 4 in isolation, without\n       considering the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole. The O\u2019Regan court did not analyze\n       section 4 in light of sections 2, 3, 5, and 11. The O\u2019Regan court did not consider\n       the purposes of the Illinois Antitrust Act or whether the court\u2019s broad reading of\n       the exemption would serve the act\u2019s purposes.\n\n\u00b6 62      The federal district court in Butler v. Jimmy John\u2019s Franchise, LLC, 331 F.\n       Supp. 3d 786, 798 (S.D. Ill. 2018) (quoting O\u2019Regan, 121 F.3d at 1066), found that\n       several competing franchisees\u2019 alleged agreement not to hire each other\u2019s\n       employees would (if proven) violate federal antitrust law, but the court followed\n       O\u2019Regan as binding precedent barring the claim for violation of the Illinois\n       Antitrust Act because the alleged agreement \u201c \u2018relate[d] to an alleged market for\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f       labor services.\u2019 \u201d Butler thus adds nothing to the slight authority of O\u2019Regan.\n\n\n\u00b6 63                     5. The Day and Temporary Labor Services Act\n\n\u00b6 64       The Staffing Services Association of Illinois and American Staffing\n       Association, in their brief amici curiae, argue that the Day and Temporary Labor\n       Services Act (Temporary Labor Act) (820 ILCS 175/1 et seq. (West 2020))\n       comprehensively regulates all staffing agencies and therefore \u201cthe Court should\n       hold that [Temporary Labor Act]-regulated staffing agencies are implicitly\n       immunized from [Illinois Antitrust Act] liability.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 65      The Temporary Labor Act includes a statement of the problem the legislature\n       sought to address:\n\n              \u201cRecent studies and a survey of low-wage day or temporary laborers\n          themselves [find] that as a group, they are particularly vulnerable to abuse of\n          their labor rights, including unpaid wages, failure to pay for all hours worked,\n          minimum wage and overtime violations, and unlawful deductions from pay for\n          meals, transportation, equipment, and other items.\n\n              Current law is inadequate to protect the labor and employment rights of\n          these workers.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.\n\n\u00b6 66       The Temporary Labor Act has no provision penalizing collusion to reduce\n       wages or to limit employment opportunities for these vulnerable employees. The\n       Temporary Labor Act does not mention the Illinois Antitrust Act, nor does it\n       explicitly exempt staffing agencies from the reach of the Illinois Antitrust Act. The\n       ruling amici seek would directly conflict with the Temporary Labor Act\u2019s stated\n       purpose, and it would exacerbate the problem of worker vulnerability the legislature\n       sought to address. We find the Temporary Labor Act provides no support for the\n       staffing agencies\u2019 position.\n\n\n\u00b6 67                            6. Summary of Legislative History\n\n\u00b6 68       The Illinois Antitrust Act directs courts to look to federal case law for aid in\n       interpreting the act \u201c[w]hen the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f       a federal antitrust law.\u201d 740 ILCS 10/11 (West 2018). This court has held that when\n       federal statutes differ from the Illinois Antitrust Act, we consider more carefully\n       whether the federal courts\u2019 reasoning helps construe the Illinois act. Gilbert\u2019s Ethan\n       Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 104. The Cordova court persuasively argues that the\n       United States Congress did not intend to exempt from antitrust scrutiny all\n       agreements between competing employers to fix wages they would pay their\n       employees and not to hire each other\u2019s employees. Cordova, 321 F. Supp. at 605-\n       07. The bar committee comments and an article by one of the proponents of the\n       Illinois Antitrust Act further support the application of Cordova\u2019s reasoning to the\n       interpretation of the Illinois Antitrust Act. Multiemployer agreements to reduce\n       wages and to reduce employment opportunities violate the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       unless the restrictions arose in the course of labor negotiations and \u201cthe affected\n       employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, *** unequivocally\n       consent[ed] to bargain with the multi-employer unit.\u201d Id. at 607. The minor\n       differences in the wording and placement of the labor exemption in the Illinois\n       Antitrust Act do not show a contrary legislative intent. The legislative inaction after\n       O\u2019Regan, which lacks precedential force in Illinois courts, does not overcome the\n       contrary inference from the Illinois Antitrust Act\u2019s stated purposes, the statutory\n       direction to look to federal decisions, and the discussions in the bar committee\n       comments and Rahl\u2019s article proposing terms for state antitrust statutes.\n\n\n\u00b6 69                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 70       We vacate the appellate court\u2019s answer to the question it formulated. We answer\n       the question the circuit court certified thus: the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in section 4\n       applies to the Illinois Antitrust Act as a whole, but it does not exclude all\n       agreements concerning labor services from the act\u2019s coverage. In particular,\n       multiemployer agreements concerning wages they will pay their employees and\n       whether they will hire each other\u2019s employees may violate the Illinois Antitrust Act\n       unless the agreement arises as part of the bargaining process and the affected\n       employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, have sought to\n       bargain with the multiemployer unit. We do not address the second question the\n       circuit court certified (see 2022 IL App (1st) 210840, \u00b6 1), or the appellate court\u2019s\n       answer to that question, because the parties have not asked this court to address that\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\f       question in this appeal.\n\n\n\u00b6 71      Appellate court judgment vacated in part.\n\n\u00b6 72      Certified question answered.\n\n\u00b6 73      Cause remanded.\n\n\n\u00b6 74       JUSTICE CUNNINGHAM took no part in the consideration or decision of this\n       case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 IL 128763</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                          IN THE\n                                 SUPREME COURT\n\n                                              OF\n                           THE STATE OF ILLINOIS\n\n\n\n\n                                     (Docket No. 128763)\n\n     THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ex rel.

The staffing\n      agencies filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the act did not apply\n\f     to the charged conduct. The circuit court of Cook County denied the motion but\n     certified for interlocutory review two questions about the reach of the act:\n\n            \u201c1.

At Colony\u2019s request, the State alleged, the staffing agencies\n     agreed to fix the wages for their employees who worked for Colony at below-\n     market rates, and they agreed not to hire each other\u2019s employees. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Colony\n     helped the staffing agencies enforce their agreement. Id. The State claimed the\n     alleged conduct constituted an agreement between competitors to fix the price paid\n     for services and therefore that it had violated section 3(1)(a) of the Illinois Antitrust\n     Act (740 ILCS 10/3(1) (West 2018)). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (1st) 210840</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 12.

Appellate Court\n\n\u00b69        The appellate court found first that the question as phrased relied on an incorrect\n     assumption that, if the definition of \u201cservice\u201d applied to the Illinois Antitrust Act\n     as a whole, it exempts all labor services from the act\u2019s coverage. Id. \u00b6 11. The\n     appellate court restated the question and addressed instead the issue of \u201cwhether\n     the exclusion of individual labor from the definition of \u2018service\u2019 in section 4 of the\n     [Illinois Antitrust Act] also excludes the labor-related services provided by\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       temporary staffing agencies and therefore exempts such agencies from [its]\n       coverage.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 10       The appellate court found that the legislature narrowed the definition of service\n       \u201cto allow individuals to engage in otherwise anticompetitive behavior regarding\n       their own labor by participating in collective bargaining and related conduct.\u201d Id.\n       \u00b6 15. The appellate court found the exemption of section 4 did not extend to services\n       provided by staffing agencies. The court held:\n\n           \u201c[T]o the extent that the alleged unlawful conduct concerns restraints that they\n           place on their own services (i.e., recruiting, hiring, and managing temporary\n           employees) and do not concern restraints on a natural person\u2019s individual labor,\n           temporary staffing agencies like the Agency Defendants in this case are subject\n           to the Act\u2019s provisions and, in particular, section 3\u2019s prohibitions on\n           anticompetitive restraints on services.\u201d Id. \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 11        This court granted the agencies\u2019 petition for leave to appeal.

The effect of this provision is to make the Act\n          inapplicable to agreements by either labor or nonlabor groups insofar as they\n          relate to restraint of competition concerning labor itself. The Act thus protects\n          both management and labor in bargaining collectively over terms and\n          conditions of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5, Committee Comments-1967, at 55.\n\n\u00b6 48       We find the bar committee commentary shows the drafters intended to limit the\n       exemption to legitimate labor union activity and agreements multiple employers\n       reach in the course of collective negotiations with labor unions.\n\n\n\u00b6 49                                    3. Rahl\u2019s Proposal\n\n\u00b6 50       In State Antitrust, Rahl proposed an antitrust act, and the proposal included the\n       following definition:\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 14 -\n\f              \u201c \u2018Service\u2019 shall mean any activity not covered by the definition of\n          commodity, which is performed in whole or in part for the purpose of financial\n          gain. \u2018Service\u2019 shall not include labor which is performed by persons as\n          employees of others, but this exclusion is limited to conduct pertaining to such\n          labor, and does not exclude from the operation of this Act agreements or acts\n          by or with laborers or organizations of laborers concerning commodities and\n          services covered by this Act.\u201d Rahl, supra, at 775.\n\n\u00b6 51      Rahl explained:\n\n          \u201cThe draft *** [makes an] exclusion for labor in the definition of \u2018services.\u2019\n          *** [The exclusion] should be sufficient to protect the right of labor\n          organizations to restrain and monopolize the terms and supply of the labor with\n          which they are concerned, and hence to carry on the customary labor activities\n          contemplated by present-day national labor policy. Incidentally, this approach\n          would also remove from the act restraints as to labor imposed by non-labor\n          groups, occurring in situations such as joint bargaining on the management\n          side.\u201d Id. at 778.\n\n\u00b6 52       Like the bar committee, Rahl emphasizes the need to exempt legitimate union\n       activity from the reach of the Illinois Antitrust Act and the correlative exemption\n       for agreements between employers in the course of negotiations with unions. No\n       source concerning the purpose of antitrust laws suggests that the legislature meant\n       to leave competing employers free to collude with each other to reduce the wages\n       they pay to their employees or to collude to prevent workers from switching to\n       better jobs.\n\n\n\u00b6 53                                 4.
