THOMAS, Circuit Judges.\n\n      JD Bols appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Mayor\n\nof San Diego (the Mayor) on his claims that the City of San Diego\u2019s moratorium\n\non the eviction of commercial tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic (the\n\nMoratorium) violated the Constitution\u2019s Takings Clause and Obligation of\n\nContracts Clause. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review de\n\nnovo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering the record in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d G & G Closed Cir. Events, LLC v.\n\nLiu, 45 F.4th 1113, 1115 (9th Cir. 2022). We affirm.\n\n      1. The Mayor argues that Bols lacks standing to sue under Article III of the\n\nConstitution because Bols likely could have evicted his tenants notwithstanding the\n\nMoratorium. Bols provided evidence, however, that he owns 99% of two LLCs\n\nthat lost roughly $60,000 in rent during the pandemic. Additionally, Bols stated\n\nduring his deposition that some of his tenants could not pay rent due to the\n\n\n\n      **\n            The Honorable Danny J. Boggs, United States Circuit Judge for the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         2\n\fpandemic, and that he believed that he could not evict them due to the Moratorium.\n\nUnder our decision in Iten v. Los Angeles, 81 F.4th 979, 992 (9th Cir. 2023), these\n\nallegations are sufficient to establish Bols\u2019s Article III standing.1\n\n      2. The Mayor claims that he has legislative immunity from Bols\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe Mayor, however, was sued only in his official capacity. \u201c[A]n official-capacity\n\nsuit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\u201d\n\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985). \u201c[P]ersonal immunity defenses\u201d\u2014\n\nsuch as absolute legislative immunity\u2014are therefore \u201cunavailable\u201d in \u201can official-\n\ncapacity action . . . .\u201d Id. at 166\u201367; see also Schmidt v. Contra Costa County, 693\n\nF.3d 1122, 1131 n.10 (9th Cir. 2012).\n\n      3. The Mayor argues that Bols\u2019s claim under the Obligation of Contracts\n\nClause is moot. Bols\u2019s requests for declaratory relief and injunctive relief were\n\nmooted by the expiration of the Moratorium. See Brach v. Newsom, 38 F.4th 6, 11\n\n(9th Cir. 2022) (finding that claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against\n\nCalifornia\u2019s pandemic-related school-closure order were mooted by the expiration\n\nof the order). And Bols has not requested monetary damages in connection with his\n\nObligation of Contracts claim. His claim under the Obligation of Contracts Clause\n\n\n1\n  The Mayor also argues that Bols lacks prudential standing under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 17 because his LLCs are the real parties in interest. We need not\nreach this issue, however, because Bols\u2019s claims fail on the merits for the reasons\ngiven below. G & G Closed Cir. Events, LLC, 45 F.4th at 1117 (we may \u201caffirm\nthe district court on any grounds the record supports\u201d).\n\n                                            3\n\fis therefore moot.\n\n      4. Bols argues that the Moratorium constitutes a per se physical taking under\n\nCedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 141 S. Ct. 2063 (2021). But the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nholding there is not as broad as Bols suggests. In Cedar Point Nursery, the Court\n\nheld only that \u201cgovernment-authorized invasions of property . . . are physical\n\ntakings requiring just compensation.\u201d Id. at 2074 (emphasis added). The\n\nMoratorium does not constitute an \u201cinvasion\u201d of property because it does not\n\nrequire commercial lessees to accommodate tenants other than those that they\n\nalready voluntarily invited. Cf. id. at 2072. This case therefore bears more\n\nsimilarity to Yee v. City of Escondido, in which the Supreme Court held that a\n\nCalifornia rent-control ordinance applicable to mobile homes did not constitute a\n\nphysical taking.2 503 U.S. 519, 526\u201332 (1992). Here, as in Yee, the government did\n\nnot \u201crequire[] any physical invasion of . . . property,\u201d because the \u201ctenants were\n\ninvited by [the owners], not forced upon them by the government.\u201d Id. at 528. And\n\nany restriction on a landlord\u2019s ability to evict tenants was temporary. Id.\n\n(explaining that the owners retained the ability to evict tenants, \u201calbeit with 6 or 12\n\n\n\n2\n  At oral argument, Bols\u2019s counsel asserted that the Moratorium also constituted a\nregulatory taking. Bols forfeited this argument, however, by failing to raise it in his\nbriefs. See Sabra v. Maricopa Cnty. Comm. Coll. Dist., 44 F.4th 867, 881 n.5 (9th\nCir. 2022). Even were we to reach this argument, the factors set forth in Penn\nCentral Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), would not\nsupport such a conclusion.\n\n                                           4\n\fmonths notice,\u201d if they wished to \u201cchange the use of [their] land\u201d).\n\n      Bols also cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alabama Ass\u2019n of Realtors\n\nv. Department of Health and Human Services, which invalidated the Centers for\n\nDisease Control\u2019s (CDC) eviction moratorium, for the proposition that eviction\n\nmoratoria intrude on \u201cthe right to exclude.\u201d 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (per\n\ncuriam). But the Supreme Court did not hold that any intrusion on the right to\n\nexclude constituted a taking. Id.

The Mayor argues that Bols lacks standing to sue under Article III of the\n\nConstitution because Bols likely could have evicted his tenants notwithstanding the\n\nMoratorium. Bols provided evidence, however, that he owns 99% of two LLCs\n\nthat lost roughly $60,000 in rent during the pandemic. Additionally, Bols stated\n\nduring his deposition that some of his tenants could not pay rent due to the\n\n\n\n      **\n            The Honorable Danny J. Boggs, United States Circuit Judge for the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         2\n\fpandemic, and that he believed that he could not evict them due to the Moratorium.\n\nUnder our decision in Iten v. Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">81 F.4th 979</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (9th Cir. 2023), these\n\nallegations are sufficient to establish Bols\u2019s Article III standing.1\n\n      2. The Mayor claims that he has legislative immunity from Bols\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe Mayor, however, was sued only in his official capacity. \u201c[A]n official-capacity\n\nsuit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\u201d\n\nKentucky v.

The Mayor argues that Bols\u2019s claim under the Obligation of Contracts\n\nClause is moot. Bols\u2019s requests for declaratory relief and injunctive relief were\n\nmooted by the expiration of the Moratorium. See Brach v. Newsom, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">38 F.4th 6</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11\n\n(9th Cir. 2022) (finding that claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against\n\nCalifornia\u2019s pandemic-related school-closure order were mooted by the expiration\n\nof the order). And Bols has not requested monetary damages in connection with his\n\nObligation of Contracts claim. His claim under the Obligation of Contracts Clause\n\n\n1\n  The Mayor also argues that Bols lacks prudential standing under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 17 because his LLCs are the real parties in interest. We need not\nreach this issue, however, because Bols\u2019s claims fail on the merits for the reasons\ngiven below. G &amp; G Closed Cir. Events, LLC, 45 F.4th at 1117 (we may \u201caffirm\nthe district court on any grounds the record supports\u201d).\n\n                                            3\n\fis therefore moot.\n\n      4. Bols argues that the Moratorium constitutes a per se physical taking under\n\nCedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">141 S. Ct. 2063 (2021)</span><pre class=\"inline\">. But the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nholding there is not as broad as Bols suggests. In Cedar Point Nursery, the Court\n\nheld only that \u201cgovernment-authorized invasions of property . . . are physical\n\ntakings requiring just compensation.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 2074</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added). The\n\nMoratorium does not constitute an \u201cinvasion\u201d of property because it does not\n\nrequire commercial lessees to accommodate tenants other than those that they\n\nalready voluntarily invited. Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 2072</span><pre class=\"inline\">. This case therefore bears more\n\nsimilarity to Yee v. City of Escondido, in which the Supreme Court held that a\n\nCalifornia rent-control ordinance applicable to mobile homes did not constitute a\n\nphysical taking.2 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">503 U.S. 519</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526\u201332 (1992). Here, as in Yee, the government did\n\nnot \u201crequire[] any physical invasion of . . . property,\u201d because the \u201ctenants were\n\ninvited by [the owners], not forced upon them by the government.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 528</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Bols forfeited this argument, however, by failing to raise it in his\nbriefs. See Sabra v. Maricopa Cnty. Comm. Coll. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">44 F.4th 867</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881 n.5 (9th\nCir. 2022). Even were we to reach this argument, the factors set forth in Penn\nCentral Transportation Co. v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109924\"><a href=\"/opinion/109924/penn-central-transportation-co-v-new-york-city/\">438 U.S. 104</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), would not\nsupport such a conclusion.\n\n                                           4\n\fmonths notice,\u201d if they wished to \u201cchange the use of [their] land\u201d).\n\n      Bols also cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alabama Ass\u2019n of Realtors\n\nv. Department of Health and Human Services, which invalidated the Centers for\n\nDisease Control\u2019s (CDC) eviction moratorium, for the proposition that eviction\n\nmoratoria intrude on \u201cthe right to exclude.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">141 S.

We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.\n\n      1.     The government points out that the BIA erroneously relied on\n\nstatutory provisions governing removal proceedings instead of those governing\n\ndeportation proceedings, which do not contain \u201ctime or numeric limits on motions\n\nto reopen.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D) addresses exceptions to filing\n\ndeadlines regarding orders entered in absentia in deportation proceedings, and it\n\nprovides that the time and numerical limitations shall not apply to a motion to\n\nreopen based on failure to receive notice.\n\n      The Board thus committed legal error and abused its discretion in\n\nconcluding that Petitioner\u2019s motion was \u201cboth time- and number-barred.\u201d See\n\nSingh v. Holder, 771 F.3d 647, 653 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that the BIA erred, and\n\nthus abused its discretion, when it denied a motion to reopen for lack of authority).\n\n      Nonetheless, the Board\u2019s error was harmless because substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Board\u2019s finding that Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of\n\neffective notice. See Zamorano v.

The Board reasoned that it already had rejected\n\nPetitioner\u2019s argument\u2014 that she failed to receive notice of the hearing\u2014twice.\n\nThe Board\u2019s finding in its two earlier denials of Petitioner\u2019s motion to\n\nreopen\u2014that Petitioner\u2019s evidence did not establish that she failed to receive notice\n\nbecause the envelope that she submitted with the incorrect address was postmarked\n\nJune 9, 1997, after the September 23, 1996 hearing\u2014is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      Petitioner is correct that the record establishes that she did not receive actual\n\nnotice of the hearing. Even though the envelope containing the notice informing\n\nher of the September 1996 hearing was sent to the correct address, the envelope\n\nwas stamped as unclaimed and returned to sender. This court has held \u2018that notice\n\nby certified mail sent to an alien\u2019s last known address can be sufficient under the\n\n[Immigration and Nationality] Act, even if no one signed for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMejia-Hernandez v.

FLETCHER, NGUYEN, and R.

We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. MacIntyre v.\n\nCarroll Coll., 48 F.4th 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2022). We have jurisdiction under 28\n\n\n\n      *\n             This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\fU.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n\n      1. To begin, we reject Hwang\u2019s argument that he pleaded a claim of\n\nconstructive discharge. While Hwang alleges with specificity the working\n\nconditions he believed were intolerable, the choice he believed was coercive, and\n\nthe reason he felt compelled to retire, each of which could support a claim for\n\nconstructive discharge, he does not take the necessary next step and raise a\n\nconstructive-discharge claim. We decline Hwang\u2019s invitation to find that\n\nreferences to a constructive discharge claim in case management filings could fix\n\nthe absence of such a claim in the complaint.\n\n      2. But even if Hwang had pleaded a constructive discharge claim, the district\n\ncourt properly granted summary judgment for NTESS. \u201cSummary judgment is\n\nproper if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is clearly\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Munoz v. Mabus, 630 F.3d 856, 860 (9th\n\nCir. 2010). On appeal, Hwang alleges that he was constructively discharged under\n\ntwo theories: intolerable working conditions and coercion. Both fail.\n\n      First, to establish constructive discharge due to intolerable working\n\nconditions, an employee must show the employer intentionally permitted working\n\nconditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would\n\nhave been compelled to resign. Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 555 (2016)\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f(federal law); Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1248-49 (1994)\n\n(state law). The working conditions must be so \u201csevere\u201d as to compel a reasonable\n\nemployee to resign. See Green, 578 U.S. at 558; accord Cloud v. Casey, 76 Cal.\n\nApp. 4th 895, 902 (1999) (\u201cintolerable or aggravated\u201d).\n\n      Here, the evidence is not enough to create a genuine issue of material fact\n\nthat intolerable working conditions existed. Hwang argues that by December of\n\n2019, working conditions at NTESS had become intolerable. This claim is belied\n\nby his attempt to rescind his decision to retire. But even if it were not, Hwang\u2019s\n\narguments are insufficient. Hwang tries to \u201cweave unrelated and disjointed events\n\ntogether\u201d into a pattern, but he does not show a \u201ccontinuous pattern\u201d of\n\naggravating conditions or discriminatory conduct. Turner, 7 Cal. 4th at 1255.\n\nWhile he alleges that he faced discrimination including a racist comment, criticism\n\nof his posture and demeanor, and false accusations of missing meetings, these\n\nfacts, even if true, are not enough to establish constructive discharge. See, e.g.,\n\nBrooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 930 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding no\n\nconstructive discharge after a woman quit her job when, after complaining of\n\nsexual harassment, she received low performance ratings, was scheduled for bad\n\nshifts, and had to work at the same time as the alleged perpetrator). Hwang also\n\ncomplains that he was the only manager forced to work with a coach, he received a\n\npoor \u201cBlock 9\u201d performance rating, and he was put on a Performance Expectation\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fPlan (PEP). But Hwang disputes neither that he received complaints about his\n\nbehavior and management style in 2016 and 2019, nor that performance issues\n\nwere raised with him in his year-end evaluations.\n\n      Second, under a coercion theory of constructive discharge, an employee\n\nmust show that a reasonable person under the same circumstances would feel\n\ncompelled to retire. Knappenberger v. City of Phoenix, 566 F.3d 936, 941-42 (9th\n\nCir. 2009). We consider \u201cwhether the employee was given an alternative to\n\nresignation or retirement, understood the choice, had a reasonable time in which to\n\ndecide, or could select the timing.\u201d Id. at 941.\n\n      Here, Hwang argues that giving him only 24 hours to decide between\n\nworking on a PEP plan, resigning, or appealing the decision was coercive,\n\nparticularly because he could not get a timely answer on whether he would lose his\n\nbenefits if he chose to contest his termination and was ultimately terminated. But\n\nHwang opted to retire and even chose his retirement date, setting it for after he\n\nused his vacation days. Although we view the 24-hour time frame given to Hwang\n\nas potentially problematic, it is nevertheless not sufficient to show that Hwang did\n\nnot have a real choice. See Knappenberger, 566 F.3d at 941-42 (a choice between\n\n\u201cunpleasant alternatives \u2026 does not of itself establish that a resignation was\n\ninduced by duress or coercion\u201d (citations omitted)). In Knappenberger, for\n\nexample, we considered a constructive discharge claim of an employee who chose\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fto retire after being given the choice to either retire early (and keep his lifetime\n\nhealth insurance) or be fired (and lose it). Id. at 939-42. We held that the employee\n\ndid not establish that he was coerced or deprived of his free will, even though he\n\nfelt he needed insurance because his wife had a history of breast cancer. Id. If\n\nthose facts failed to show coercion, so do the facts here. Hwang was not forced to\n\nchoose between retirement and termination, even though he alleges that he felt\n\ntermination was inevitable.\n\n      3. Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nHwang\u2019s retaliation claim under Title VII and California\u2019s Fair Employment and\n\nHousing Act (FEHA). Hwang argues that NTESS retaliated against him by\n\nrefusing to accept his rescission of retirement. Hwang\u2019s decision to retire was\n\naccepted by NTESS the same day. NTESS\u2019s refusal to accept Hwang\u2019s attempt to\n\nrescind his retirement a month later was not an adverse action that \u201cmaterially\n\naffect[ed] the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of [his] employment.\u201d\n\nChuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1126 (9th Cir.\n\n2000). Other courts have held that the \u201cfailure to accept the employee\u2019s rescission\n\nof [his] voluntary resignation is not an adverse employment action.\u201d Featherstone\n\nv. S. California Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1163-64 (2017)\n\n(citation omitted) (collecting cases). We agree.\n\n      This evidence is also not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\ffor retaliation under Title VII, which would require Hwang to establish that\n\nNTESS\u2019s refusal to accept his retirement rescission would deter a reasonable\n\nperson from reporting discrimination.

Hwang also\n\ncomplains that he was the only manager forced to work with a coach, he received a\n\npoor \u201cBlock 9\u201d performance rating, and he was put on a Performance Expectation\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fPlan (PEP). But Hwang disputes neither that he received complaints about his\n\nbehavior and management style in 2016 and 2019, nor that performance issues\n\nwere raised with him in his year-end evaluations.\n\n      Second, under a coercion theory of constructive discharge, an employee\n\nmust show that a reasonable person under the same circumstances would feel\n\ncompelled to retire.

But\n\nHwang opted to retire and even chose his retirement date, setting it for after he\n\nused his vacation days. Although we view the 24-hour time frame given to Hwang\n\nas potentially problematic, it is nevertheless not sufficient to show that Hwang did\n\nnot have a real choice.

Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nHwang\u2019s retaliation claim under Title VII and California\u2019s Fair Employment and\n\nHousing Act (FEHA). Hwang argues that NTESS retaliated against him by\n\nrefusing to accept his rescission of retirement. Hwang\u2019s decision to retire was\n\naccepted by NTESS the same day. NTESS\u2019s refusal to accept Hwang\u2019s attempt to\n\nrescind his retirement a month later was not an adverse action that \u201cmaterially\n\naffect[ed] the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of [his] employment.\u201d\n\nChuang v.

See 5th Cir. R. 47.5.\n\fCase: 23-50349      Document: 00517037889          Page: 2    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 23-50349\n\n\n   The district court noted that Baldwin had been previously barred from filing\n   a cause of action without obtaining approval from a federal district or\n   magistrate judge; to the extent that Baldwin was seeking authorization to file,\n   the district court concluded that her claims were frivolous. Baldwin then\n   moved to reopen the case, asserting that Judge Pitman and the district court\n   judge who had ruled on her action were biased against her. The district court\n   denied the motion to reopen, again concluding that Baldwin\u2019s attempts to\n   challenge the validity of prior rulings should have been through direct appeals\n   in those cases. Baldwin has now filed a motion for authorization to proceed\n   in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, which constitutes a challenge to the\n   district court\u2019s certification that any appeal would not be taken in good faith\n   because Baldwin will not present a nonfrivolous appellate issue. See Baugh v.\n   Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).\n          Before this court, Baldwin repeats her assertions that Judge Pitman\u2019s\n   prior rulings were wrong and evinced bias against her and that she is entitled\n   to reconsideration of those decisions. She also maintains that the district\n   court should not have entered the vexatious litigant order in an earlier action.\n   Baldwin has not shown that the district court erred in ruling that any\n   challenges to those earlier rulings should have been presented in appeals from\n   those cases, rather than through new lawsuits. See Alvestad v. Monsanto Co.,\n   671 F.2d 908, 912 (5th Cir. 1982) (noting we review such decisions under an\n   abuse of discretion standard). In addition, she has not shown that her\n   assertions of bias against the district judge who ruled in those cases could not\n   have been raised and appealed in those proceedings. See Liteky v. United\n   States, 510 U.S. 540, 543-56 (1994).

Baldwin\u2019s motion to\n   reinstate a dissent order is DENIED.\n          The instant case is Baldwin\u2019s eighth attempt in federal court to\n   challenge the denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising from injuries\n   she suffered in 2006 and 2007.

Baldwin then\n   moved to reopen the case, asserting that Judge Pitman and the district court\n   judge who had ruled on her action were biased against her. The district court\n   denied the motion to reopen, again concluding that Baldwin\u2019s attempts to\n   challenge the validity of prior rulings should have been through direct appeals\n   in those cases. Baldwin has now filed a motion for authorization to proceed\n   in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, which constitutes a challenge to the\n   district court\u2019s certification that any appeal would not be taken in good faith\n   because Baldwin will not present a nonfrivolous appellate issue.

She also maintains that the district\n   court should not have entered the vexatious litigant order in an earlier action.\n   Baldwin has not shown that the district court erred in ruling that any\n   challenges to those earlier rulings should have been presented in appeals from\n   those cases, rather than through new lawsuits.

(\u201cthe children\u201d), and granting permanent custody of the children to appellee,\n\nWilliams County Job and Family Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d). For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe affirm the judgment.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} Mother sets forth three assignments of error:\n\n             1. The trial court abused its discretion in denying A.H. and K.M.\u2019s\n\n      joint motion to dismiss based on the passage of time.\n\n             2. The trial court committed plain error by not dismissing the case as\n\n      to [the children] for the GAL\u2019s [(Guardian Ad Litem)] failure to perform\n\n      his duties, to the prejudice of A.H.\n\n             3. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and finding\n\n      that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\n      convincing evidence.\n\n      {\u00b6 3} Father sets forth one assignment of error:\n\n             1. The trial court errored [sic] when it granted the motion for\n\n      permanent custody [sic] because the original complaint had been filed more\n\n      than two years prior.\n\n                                      Background\n\n      {\u00b6 4} Mother has four biological children: S.O., born in or about 2008; X.H., born\n\nin 2010; M.M., born in November 2018; and B.M., born in April 2020. S.O. and X.H.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fwere fathered by men other than K.M., and are not involved in this appeal. However,\n\nS.O. and X.H. will be mentioned when pertinent and significant to this appeal.\n\n         {\u00b6 5} The agency\u2019s involvement with mother, father and the children spanned\n\nthree years, 2020 through 2023, during which time four cases were filed and numerous\n\ncourt hearings were held. What occurred at these hearings is helpful to understanding the\n\nprogression of the cases, thus, the relevant events are summarized below.\n\n2020\n\n         {\u00b6 6} On April 29, 2020, the agency became involved with the family when\n\nmother tested positive for oxycodone (\u201coxy\u201d), methamphetamine (\u201cmeth\u201d) and\n\namphetamine (\u201camphet\u201d)1 at the time of B.M.\u2019s premature birth. Mother denied drug\n\nuse. In May 2020, mother tested positive for meth, and again denied drug use. Safety\n\nplans were established by the agency for the benefit of all four of mother\u2019s children.\n\n         {\u00b6 7} On July 13, 2020, complaints were filed which alleged the children were\n\ndependent and neglected; father\u2019s overdose in December 2019 was mentioned.\n\n         {\u00b6 8} The agency established case plans for mother and father, which were\n\nagreeable to the parents. Mother\u2019s case plan required her to: maintain housing and\n\nemployment; complete PRC2 applications, parenting classes and the Family Intervention\n\n\n\n1\n    Meth is converted by the body into amphet.\n2\n PRC paid for visitations, parenting classes and other services. Without a completed\napplication, the parent had to self-pay for the services.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fCourt program (\u201cFIC\u201d); comply with home visits and drug screens; and undergo\n\nsubstance use and mental health treatment. Father\u2019s case plan was the same, but FIC was\n\nnot included.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On August 12, 2020, GAL Aaron Cook filed a report concerning the family\n\nmembers. Also on the day, the children were adjudicated neglected and dependent, and\n\nthe agency was granted protective supervision of the children.\n\n2021\n\n                    Semi-Annual Review Hearing - January 5, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Mother attended the hearing and consented to the agency\u2019s continued\n\nprotective supervision of the children. Father did not attend the hearing.\n\n                  Annual Review Hearing/GAL Report - July 1, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 11} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother attended the hearing via Zoom, father did not attend. In April\n\n2021, mother had a random drug screen and was positive for meth, she failed to show for\n\nan appointment at Recovery Services (\u201cRecovery\u201d), and cancelled an appointment.\n\nMother then started inpatient treatment at Serenity Haven (\u201cSerenity\u201d); she was sober and\n\ntaking parenting classes. Her 68-year-old grandfather, T.V. (the children\u2019s great-\n\ngrandfather), took in all four of mother\u2019s children while she was in inpatient treatment.\n\nMother had two visits with the children, but visits stopped due to a verbal altercation and\n\nbecause the children had severe head lice.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\f       {\u00b6 13} In May and June 2021, father had three random drug screens and tested\n\npositive for, respectively: THC; cocaine, meth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet and\n\nTHC. The court suspended father\u2019s visits with the children due to his failure to comply\n\nwith the case plan. Protective supervision of the children was continued.\n\n                                   Show Cause - Father\n\n       {\u00b6 14} On August 12, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging father\n\nfailed to follow the court\u2019s orders; a hearing on the motion was scheduled for September\n\n8, 2021. However, father emailed the caseworker that he could not attend the hearing\n\nbecause his 20-year-old daughter died and the funeral was in Kentucky on September 8,\n\n2021. The court rescheduled the hearing, and ordered father to provide written\n\nverification of his daughter\u2019s death and funeral.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The show cause hearing was for rescheduled September 15, 2021, but\n\nfather failed to appear and there was no communication with him since his email. The\n\ncourt issued a bench warrant for father; he was arrested.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} On September 22, 2021, a bond hearing was held, with father present, and a\n\n$5,000 bond was requested to ensure father\u2019s appearance at a future hearing. Father told\n\nthe court that he lived in a trailer (\u201cthe trailer\u201d) and \u201ccame back up here to help [mother]\n\nget her place fixed up. We was working things out, I\u2019ve been there all year. That\u2019s my\n\nphysical address.\u201d Father claimed he had no money for bond, as all of his money was\n\nwrapped up in the trailer. The judge ordered $5,000 bond, no 10%.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       {\u00b6 17} On September 28, 2021, the show cause hearing was held, and father\n\nadmitted he violated the court\u2019s orders. The court accepted father\u2019s admissions, released\n\nhim from custody and scheduled a sentencing date.\n\n                          Review Hearing - October 21, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 18} The 15-month review hearing was held; mother was present, father was\n\nnot, as his attorney indicated that father was working and could not miss work. It was\n\nrequested that protective custody be extended. Mother claimed she was not in\n\nrelationship with father and continued to work her case plan, but she had a positive drug\n\nscreen in September 2021. Father tested positive for THC in early October 2021, and he\n\ntested positive for a relatively high level of meth, amphet and THC in mid-October 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} GAL Cook testified and voiced numerous concerns. First, T.V. spent less\n\ntime with mother\u2019s four children, so mother stepped in to help. The two older children\n\nwere criminally charged for property damage, and school was not great. Next, despite\n\ncourt orders that father have only supervised visits, when he was in jail the video footage\n\nrevealed that he asked mother to allow him to see the children and she complied. The\n\nGAL viewed another video in which mother said to father that the court expected her to\n\nbreak up with him, but she had no intention of doing so; she would just tell the court what\n\nit wanted to hear. The GAL questioned how much progress the parents made in the last\n\n15 months, and thought future options should be explored, as the parents seemed intent\n\non deceiving the court and not working the process.\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\f         {\u00b6 20} The court temporarily extended protective custody; a full hearing was\n\nscheduled to determine whether to continue protective custody beyond the one-year\n\nmark.\n\n     GAL Report/Motion to Extend Protective Custody Hearing - November 12, 2021\n\n         {\u00b6 21} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family members.\n\n         {\u00b6 22} Mother and father attended the hearing. Mother completed inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, outpatient treatment at Recovery and was in aftercare sessions.\n\nOverall, she made significant progress in her case plan services, yet she was unemployed,\n\nreceived disability payments, had not secured her own housing and had only T.V. for\n\nsupport.\n\n         {\u00b6 23} Father completed an assessment at Recovery and it was initially\n\nrecommended that he attend individual counseling, submit to random drug screens and go\n\nto medication management services. However, due to father\u2019s positive drug screens,\n\nintensive outpatient group sessions were suggested. Father was drug tested by the agency\n\ntwice a month, and all screens were positive for illegal drugs. It was reported that\n\nbetween July and October 2021, father refused some drug screens and threatened agency\n\nworkers, so no meetings were attempted with him due to safety concerns. Father\u2019s\n\nbehavior improved, he was civil and he apologized for his actions.\n\n         {\u00b6 24} In late October 2021, father suffered a serious leg injury. He disclosed that\n\nhe received social security disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) and worked construction on the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fside; he did not verify his work. Father lived at the trailer, owned by the trailer park, and\n\npaid lot rent and utilities. Since April 2021, he made improvements on the trailer. He\n\nslowly worked on his case plan and made some progress.\n\n        {\u00b6 25} The court granted the agency\u2019s motion to extend protective supervision.\n\n        Sanction Hearing for Father\u2019s Contempt Citation - November 23, 2021\n\n        {\u00b6 26} Father provided the court with the obituary for his 22-year-old step-\n\ndaughter, who died in Kentucky on August 20, 2021. Father attended the viewing on or\n\nabout August 24, 2021, but not the funeral, and he returned to Ohio on September 1,\n\n2021.\n\n        {\u00b6 27} The agency indicated that father was cooperative, signed a release of\n\ninformation and allowed four home visits; the trailer was clean and father claimed that\n\nonly he will live there. He attended one individual treatment session at Recovery, on\n\nNovember 1, 2021, did not attend two later sessions and failed to participate in intensive\n\ngroup sessions. He claimed he completed a TeleMed mental health assessment in\n\nNovember 2021. Father\u2019s two drug tests by Recovery were positive for, respectively:\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet, THC, THC3 and hydromorphone (for which\n\nfather had a prescription), and his two drug screens by the agency, conducted on different\n\ndates than Recovery\u2019s tests, were both positive for meth, amphet and THC. Father was\n\nunable to visit the children due to his leg injury.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f        {\u00b6 28} The agency recommended, as a sanction for the contempt citation, that\n\nfather attend the Renewal Center (\u201cRenewal\u201d) and complete any recommended treatment;\n\nno jail time was recommended if successfully completed Renewal.\n\n        {\u00b6 29} The court sentenced father to 30 days in jail, which were suspended if he\n\nsuccessfully completed Renewal or any other inpatient rehab and complied with all\n\noutpatient orders and recommendations.\n\n                                  Show Cause - Mother\n\n        {\u00b6 30} On December 28, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging\n\nmother failed to follow the court\u2019s orders. On December 30, 2021, a motion hearing was\n\nheld, with mother present. It was reported that on December 8, 2021, mother was drug\n\nscreened by Recovery and tested positive for Gabapentin, which she was prescribed, but\n\n\u201cit came back at a high level,\u201d and she was also screened by FIC, and tested positive for\n\nmeth. On December 10, 2021, she was drug screened by Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth. Mother was drug tested by the agency in November and December 2021, on\n\ndifferent days than Recovery and FIC, and all tests were negative.\n\n        {\u00b6 31} The positive drug tests were discussed with mother; she did not admit to\n\ndrug use. Recovery recommended intensive outpatient treatment, while FIC\n\nrecommended inpatient treatment at Serenity, where she would be admitted on January 4,\n\n2022.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 32} The court found mother in contempt by violating her case plan when she,\n\ninter alia, tested positive for illegal drugs. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, to be\n\nserved immediately unless she purged the contempt by completing a refresher course at\n\nSerenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The court granted emergency custody of all four of mother\u2019s children to the\n\nagency. The four children were removed from the home and placed in foster homes.\n\n2022\n\n                        Motion for Reconsideration and Hearing\n\n       {\u00b6 34} On January 5, 2022, mother filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ncourt\u2019s findings that she violated the court\u2019s orders by using illegal drugs, not being\n\ntruthful or cooperative, and continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} On January 10, 2022, a hearing was held and mother presented evidence\n\nthat on January 3, 2022, she took a hair follicle test and no drugs were detected. She\n\ntestified, and presented the testimony of the worker who collected her hair sample, sent it\n\nout for testing and received the test results. The agency offered the testimony of a\n\nforensic toxicologist, who studied the effects of drugs on the body and worked in a\n\nlaboratory which specialized in detecting drugs in biological fluids.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The court found the science clearly showed there was meth in mother\u2019s\n\ndrug screen, which was a violation of the court\u2019s order. The court found nothing to\n\noverturn its previous findings, and denied mother\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f      Hearing on Temporary Custody and Motion for Sanctions - January 31, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 37} Mother and father were present at the hearing and both consented to the\n\nagency\u2019s request for temporary custody of the children. Father then asked to be removed\n\nfrom the case plan, which the court permitted; the agency withdrew its motion for\n\nsanctions.\n\n        {\u00b6 38} The court granted temporary custody of the children to the agency.\n\n                             Review Hearing - March 9, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 39} Mother attended the hearing, father did not. It was reported that father\n\nwanted to be on back on the case plan again; he was added back. Mother was in inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, she was compliant and had an expected out-date of April 5, 2022.\n\nIt was not known where mother would live when released, as the agency conducted a\n\nhome study of T.V., and while he passed his background check and his home was\n\napproved, he had four positive screens for THC so more random drug tests were sought.\n\nMother visited with the children, and there were no concerns. The children did well in\n\ntheir foster home, although M.M. struggled and cried a lot at first due to her attachment\n\nissues with mother.\n\n        {\u00b6 40} The court found it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain in their\n\ncurrent placement, and for the agency to have temporary custody. Father\u2019s 30-day jail\n\nsentence was reimposed, but suspended if he successfully completed inpatient drug\n\ntreatment.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f                   GAL Reports - June 27, 2022, July 1 and 24, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 41} GAL Cook filed reports with updates as to each family member.\n\n                       Semi-Annual Review Hearing - July 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Bother parents attended the hearing. Also before the court was a motion to\n\ndetermine the status of father\u2019s case plan, as he was added back to the plan on March 10,\n\n2022, but then said he did not want to be on the case plan. Father\u2019s counsel indicated\n\nfather wanted to be on the case plan and father was willing to sign the plan that day.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Father completed no case plan goals, and his last drug screen for the\n\nagency on May 4, 2022, was positive for THC and fentanyl. The caseworker attempted\n\nto visit or meet with father 11 times, but father did not answer the door or he was a no-\n\nshow. He visited the children every other week, which went well. Father showed the\n\nchildren a picture of a puppy, and said he and mother bought the puppy.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Mother lived with T.V., whose home was approved for the children.\n\nMother did not work; she received SSDI. She visited the children every other week for\n\ntwo hours, and the visits went very well.\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Mother had a positive drug screen for meth on June 27, 2022, and went\n\nback into Recovery\u2019s IOP (intensive outpatient program), which she attended once a\n\nweek. It was recommended by Recovery that mother go for inpatient treatment; she did\n\nnot comply. Mother was unsuccessfully released from FIC, which was considered a case\n\nplan fail.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 46} The agency was concerned that parents were in a relationship, despite\n\nmother\u2019s claims to the contrary. The parents were seen together many times, including in\n\nApril 2022, when the caseworker saw them together at Wal-Mart, and in June 2022,\n\nwhen the worker saw them in a car together. The worker addressed the June sighting\n\nwith mother, but she claimed they were not together and she had been at home all day.\n\nMother also said father was friends with T.V., and went to T.V.\u2019s home for visits. The\n\nagency made it clear that if the parents were in a relationship, they were judged as a\n\nwhole, so father\u2019s illegal drug use and noncompliance with the case plan reflected on\n\nmother. The agency did not believe mother and father were honest.\n\n       {\u00b6 47} The children were doing very well in their foster placement, their medical\n\nneeds were met, and there were no concerns with them remaining in the foster home.\n\n       {\u00b6 48} Mother testified she went to Wal-Mart with father a couple of weeks after\n\nshe was released from Serenity because she did not have a car; she was released on April\n\n5, 2022. She claimed she did not get a puppy with father; he bought a puppy for the\n\nchildren and the puppy was with mother at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 49} Mother was aware of the recommendation for inpatient treatment at\n\nSerenity, but said she was told if she \u201ccontinued to do what I need to do, sign a behavior\n\ncontract and another piece of paper stating that I will be clean, and do whatever the paper\n\nstates then I should be okay with * * * continuing with IOP.\u201d She did not want to go the\n\nSerenity because \u201cthey\u2019re not very confidential with their information for their clients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\f      {\u00b6 50} Regarding mother\u2019s positive screen for meth on June 27, 2022, she said,\n\n\u201cactually, I wouldn\u2019t have graduated IOP if my cup would have come back positive. My\n\ncup come back negative. * * * [M]y sister and I have been arguing quite often. She went\n\non and told people that she knew that I\u2019m not going to get my kids back, she don\u2019t want\n\nme to have my kids back and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes for me not to get my kids back.\u201d\n\nWhen mother was asked how that translated to a positive screen for meth, she replied,\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on the partying kick and I\u2019m not because I want my kids and I told her that.\n\nI honestly think she did something to my drink.\u201d Mother was questioned about the\n\nspecific circumstances when she was with her sister, and she said,\n\n             It would have been like a Friday or Saturday. Then I found out the\n\n      previous week after me hanging out with her that she was going around\n\n      asking people if she knew me, or if they knew and they were like well I\n\n      know of her, why? And she went about saying well I heard she\u2019s not going\n\n      to get her kids back and she don\u2019t deserve them back, she don\u2019t you know I\n\n      don\u2019t talk to my sister on that kind of level. I don\u2019t want her knowing none\n\n      of my business, I don\u2019t want nobody knowing none of my business unless it\n\n      comes from my mouth.\n\n      {\u00b6 51} When mother was asked if she knew that drugging someone\u2019s drink was a\n\ncrime, she said she knew now, but would not file a police report because \u201cshe\u2019s trying to\n\nget herself out of her situation. I\u2019m not cool with that.\u201d Mother denied using drugs.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\f       {\u00b6 52} Mother was also questioned about her positive drug screen prior to June\n\n2022; she again denied drug use. She could not remember the background of that\n\nprevious screen.\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Father testified, and was asked if he would go to the recommended\n\ninpatient treatment, to which he replied, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do, I mean just everything\u2019s got\n\nmy mind boggled. I mean.\u201d When asked if that was a yes or no, he said, \u201cYes, most\n\ndefinitely, I mean but.\u201d He claimed he was in inpatient treatment for two days, and\n\n\u201cwent from there to the hospital after that because I needed medical attention and well the\n\nRenewed Minds down here in town put me on medication, Suboxone, and that just\n\ndestroyed me.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 54} Father was questioned about overdosing on December 11, 2019, and said,\n\n\u201cI did not overdose.\u201d When asked if he remembered getting Narcan by EMS, he said,\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of why, well okay, now I\u2019m epileptic. I\u2019ve been on medication for that all\n\nmy life, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, stuff like that. And uh, but there were no positive\n\nscreens for anything like that.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 55} Father was asked about testing positive for fentanyl and he said he took the\n\ndrug test the day after he got out of the hospital where he was given painkillers for his\n\nknee, which he claimed almost had to be amputated. He was asked if he was on\n\npainkillers still, and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking no pain killers or nothing like that.\u201d He\n\nwas then asked when he stopped taking prescribed painkillers and he said, \u201cAs soon as I\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\fgot out of the hospital. * * * So it was like November or December. * * * That was like\n\nPercocet that was when I got out of the hospital.\u201d Father admitted marijuana use.\n\n       {\u00b6 56} The court ordered mother and father to submit to a drug test \u201cright now\n\nwhile we\u2019re here,\u201d then report back to court. Mother\u2019s drug screen was negative while\n\nfather was positive for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Father was sentenced to 30 days in jail, and was ordered to report to jail\n\nthat afternoon. The court indicated that prior to the expiration of 30 days, if father was\n\naccepted to inpatient facility, a transfer from jail to the facility would be considered.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but the court allowed her 15 days\n\nto provide verification that she was accepted into inpatient treatment. The court noted, at\n\nthe end of 15 days, if no verification was filed, mother would serve 30 days in jail.\n\n                                Hearing - August 18, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 59} The hearing was held on the court\u2019s own motion; mother was present,\n\nfather was not. Mother did not go for inpatient treatment; she said it was very difficult to\n\nget into treatment because she was not with a provider and she had to care for T.V., who\n\nhad cancer and received chemotherapy. She claimed she had an assessment scheduled\n\nfor August 30, 2022, at A Renewed Mind (\u201cRenewed\u201d), after which she could go for IOP\n\nand counseling. She offered to go to jail on weekends and take care of T.V. during the\n\nweek, at least until she found another caregiver. She did not have verification of T.V.\u2019s\n\ncancer treatments.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f         {\u00b6 60} GAL Cook testified that T.V.\u2019s care was discussed the previous week, so\n\nmother had time to make alternate plans for his care. The GAL also noted mother was\n\nsentenced to 30 days in jail over eight months ago, so she had opportunities to address the\n\nissue.\n\n         {\u00b6 61} The court imposed the 30-day sentence and ordered mother to report to jail\n\nthe next day.\n\n                            Review Hearing - October 25, 2022\n\n         {\u00b6 62} Neither parent was present for the hearing. Mother claimed they were\n\ntravelling to court together when the car broke down, and they were waiting for the police\n\nto help.\n\n         {\u00b6 63} The caseworker reported she conducted a home visit with father outside of\n\nthe trailer, in September 2022, two days after he was released from jail. He began his\n\ncase plan; he attended IOP at Renewed, but missed sessions and he went to two parenting\n\nclasses, then missed one. He tested positive for alcohol and THC, and on October 11,\n\n2022, he was positive for meth. It was unknown if he worked. Father claimed he was\n\nselling the trailer, and listed mother\u2019s address as his address. He had supervised visits\n\nwith the children, which went well.\n\n         {\u00b6 64} After mother was released from jail, she attended IOP at Renewed, four\n\ndays a week. She resided with T.V., and although the caseworker stopped by the home\n\nmany times to see mother and conduct random drug screens, she was never home and\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fthere were no home visits since May 2022. Mother went to the agency to meet and took\n\ndrug tests, which were negative. Mother and father disclosed they were together, lived\n\ntogether at T.V.\u2019s home and had supervised visits with the children together. At that\n\npoint, the agency was not concerned about their relationship.\n\n       {\u00b6 65} The children were doing very well in the foster home where they were\n\nplaced in December 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} GAL Cook testified the case was in the same place that it was at the last\n\nhearing, with miniscule, incremental improvements. Father enrolled in treatment and\n\nparenting classes, but missed classes and had positive drug screens. Father never\n\ncompleted any treatment course and never had a negative drug screen. The GAL\n\nreported that in early 2022, after a court hearing, father had to be revived with Narcan.\n\n       {\u00b6 67} The court ordered that temporary custody of the children remain with the\n\nagency.\n\n            Fifth Semi-Annual Hearing/GAL Report - December 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 68} GAL Cook filed a report with updates with respect to the family members.\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Mother and father were present for the hearing, and also before the court\n\nwas the agency\u2019s motion to extend temporary custody, filed on December 13, 2022. The\n\nagency withdrew its motion, as an extension was barred by statute.\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Caseworker Alaina Russell testified the children were doing very well in\n\ntheir foster home, and visited with the parents bi-weekly for two to three hours. Mother\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\fwas completing treatment at Renewed and doing well, but she missed dates due to T.V.\u2019s\n\nmedical appointments; T.V. had since passed away. She had three random drug tests and\n\none test at the agency; all were negative. Mother\u2019s last positive drug test was in June\n\n2022. She was on disability, did not work and lived with father at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Father was drug tested at Renewed and was negative for substances in\n\nNovember and December 2022, however during that time, Russell was unable to do\n\nhome visits with father or drug screens; his last screen, taken the end of October 2022,\n\nwas positive for THC. Father had a job and worked third shift. He completed two out of\n\nten parenting classes. Visits went very well, and the children were bonded to their\n\nparents.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} GAL Cook testified that father made considerable progress, at least on\n\npaper, but \u201cit is a touch disappointing that it comes too little too late.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} The court ordered that temporary custody remain with the agency.\n\n\n2023\n\n       {\u00b6 74} On January 31, 2023, the agency filed its motion for permanent custody of\n\nthe children. On February 2, 2023, the parents filed a joint motion to return the children\n\nto their care, as they alleged the agency did not timely file the permanent custody motion.\n\n                                 Hearing - March 23, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 75} The court noted two motions were pending: a motion for permanent\n\ncustody, filed by the agency on January 31, 2023; and the joint motion to dismiss. The\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\fcourt scheduled a trial on the motion for permanent custody and held a hearing on the\n\nmotion to dismiss. Both parents were present, and called Melinda Reynolds, the\n\nsupervisor of the agency\u2019s ongoing unit, as a witness.\n\n                              Melinda Reynolds\u2019 Testimony\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Reynolds was assigned as the ongoing caseworker for the family in\n\nFebruary 2023, and was familiar with the history of the case. She attempted home visits\n\nwith father in February 2023, but was unable to make contact. His last drug screen for\n\nthe agency, in mid-December 2022, was negative.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} On January 23, 2023, a police report was received which alleged that father\n\nhad overdosed. The agency tried to call father that day and the next to have him report\n\nfor a drug screen; no contact was made and father did not report. Father had claimed that\n\nhe worked so he was unable to go to the agency, so a caseworker offered to meet him at\n\nwork, or after, to drug screen him, but father did not cooperate. Father denied drug use.\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father attended services at Renewed, he tested negative for drugs and was\n\nlast seen on February 15, 2023. From October 2022 through January 2023, father missed\n\n17 IOP appointments at Renewed. Mother graduated from relapse prevention and\n\ncontinued \u201cto do individuals.\u201d Reynolds was unaware of any positive drug screens for\n\nmother since October 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father and mother told Reynolds they lived in T.V.\u2019s home and father\n\nworked.\n\n\n\n\n20.\n\f        {\u00b6 80} Reynolds stated substance abuse was a problem which was not resolved or\n\nsufficiently mitigated due to father\u2019s missed drug treatment appointments and his alleged\n\noverdose, where mother called 911 and stated father was turning blue in the face and she\n\nwas performing CPR on him. The police report indicated there was a strong and\n\noverwhelming odor of alcohol on father and there was a white substance in his nostrils.\n\n        {\u00b6 81} It was Reynolds\u2019 original belief that father was drug tested regularly\n\nthrough the IOP, but she learned he had not been tested in about five weeks.\n\n                                     Father\u2019s Testimony\n\n        {\u00b6 82} Father moved in with mother in August 2022, and was in drug treatment at\n\nOhio Guidestone (\u201cGuidestone\u201d)3 for three or four months; he said \u201c[i]t\u2019s been a while. *\n\n* * Well, since August [2022].\u201d He claimed his participation had been regular, but he\n\nstarted a job, had job training and had transportation issues, so it was difficult to attend,\n\nalthough he took drug screens. Since February 15, 2023, he said he was at Guidestone\n\nconsistently twice a week and was drug tested; he did not recall when his last positive\n\ndrug screen was, as \u201cit\u2019s been too long to even recall. * * * I mean it\u2019s been past August I\n\nmean.\u201d He had worked for three months, 40 hours a week.\n\n        {\u00b6 83} Father claimed the alleged overdose on January 23, 2023, was caused by\n\nblood clotting due to his leg injury, which made him get real hot and faint, and almost\n\ncaused a heart attack. He admitted he drank that day, but denied drug use. He said he\n\n\n\n3\n    Guidestone was formerly called A Renewed Mind.\n\n\n\n21.\n\fwent to Renewed on January 24, 25, 26 and 27, 2023, and took drug screens which were\n\nall negative. He did not have recent contact with Reynolds because she did not try to\n\nreach out to him to have him drug tested or do a home visit. Father said he would move\n\nout of the home, if required, so the children could be returned to mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} Father was asked if he remembered saying, at a Zoom meeting on\n\nJanuary 27, 2023, that a car fell on his chest on January 23, 2023, and took the air out of\n\nhim; he replied, \u201cI was working on my car and I remember coming in and sitting down\n\nand that\u2019s, I just got light headed and got real hot.\u201d Father was aware the police report\n\nstated he had a white substance in his nostrils, but he claimed that was \u201cFoam. Spit.\n\nSnot.\u201d He did not recall that the report said the police believed that father\u2019s two friends,\n\nwho were present, were also under the influence of narcotics.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Father was questioned about lying to the agency about his drug use and his\n\nrelationship with mother, and said, \u201cNo, I have not lied. We got back together in August.\n\n* * * They seen us together. Like I would go pick her up, take her to the store, stuff like\n\nthat, I mean, you know but we got back together in August.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father acknowledged he had to complete parenting classes, and was\n\nworking on it but \u201c[t]he woman, Jana, she is having problems cause see my schedule with\n\nwork and stuff to get me there. I already took five (5) classes of it.

I was in jail for thirty (30) days and after I\u2019ve got out I\u2019ve been, so is that, yea,\n\nsince I\u2019ve been clean? * * * Yea, it was I would say August.\u201d He did not recall testing\n\npositive for marijuana on October 26, 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} GAL Cook asked father when IOP with Guidestone would be completed\n\nand father said next week; father did not know how long the program usually took.\n\nFather admitted that on January 23, 2023, he drank three big cans of beer which was like\n\na six-pack. He was asked if drinking was recommended as part of his sobriety and he\n\nreplied, \u201cIt\u2019s not anything you know, I mean.\u201d He said he drank once in a while, not\n\nregularly.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} The court asked father about consuming alcohol, and observed that\n\ndrinking a six-pack at one time seemed to fly in the face of the sobriety issues, to which\n\nfather replied, \u201cI understand where you are coming from, yea. It was a six (6) pack but it\n\nwas between me and a friend you know, so, so what I had a total of you know.\u201d The\n\ncourt told father he just changed his testimony, and father said, \u201cUh, yea, I understand\n\nwhere, yea.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Father failed to bring documentation of his Guidestone treatment, but said,\n\n\u201cI talked to Lisa yesterday and she was going to fax over paperwork. I could actually get\n\nit faxed to [the caseworker] like soon as I leave here. That I have actually been going or\n\nyou know contact Lisa and have her get a hold of the caseworker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\f       {\u00b6 91} GAL Cook observed that based on father\u2019s testimony, his drug use was not\n\nseriously mitigated and there were many occasions when his sobriety was called into\n\nquestion, even by father\u2019s own testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6 92} The court allowed the parties time to file Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law, as to whether the cases should be dismissed since timeliness was not met, or\n\nwhether the court had jurisdiction so the cases could go to trial. The court recessed.\n\n              Judgment Entry on Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 93} The juvenile court found that it retained jurisdiction of the cases, and\n\ndenied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court\u2019s findings are more fully set forth\n\nbelow, under mother and father\u2019s first assignments of error.\n\n                            Mother\u2019s Motion to Return Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 94} On April 14, 2023, mother filed a motion to return custody of the children\n\nto her or to grant legal custody to paternal grandmother. In May 2023, mother withdrew\n\nher motion to grant legal custody of the children to paternal grandmother.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 1, May 19, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Two motions were before the court: the agency\u2019s motion for permanent\n\ncustody and mother\u2019s motion to return custody of the children to her. The court reserved\n\nits finding on mother\u2019s motion until after testimony was heard. The trial on the motion\n\nfor permanent custody trial proceeded.

Upon arrival at T.V.\u2019s home, father, T.V., mother and mother\u2019s\n\ntwo older children were present. Father was on the floor, pale, snarling when he breathed\n\nand with an accelerated pulse rate, which were all general signs of an overdose. The\n\nsergeant was also aware of father\u2019s history of drug abuse, and it was suspected that father\n\nused heroin. Narcan was administered and eventually father became conscious.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} Father claimed he had a sleeping disorder and denied using drugs, even\n\nthough the sergeant explained that Narcan only disrupted an opioid overdose, and given\n\nfather\u2019s reaction to Narcan it was pretty obvious what happened. Father was given an\n\nimmunity letter, which gave a drug abuser 30 days to check into rehab or potentially face\n\ncriminal charges. Father did not go to rehab, nor was he criminally charged.\n\nLt. Darrell Higbie\n\n       {\u00b6 98} The lieutenant was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing. He worked for the MPD and on July 15, 2022, around noontime, he\n\nresponded to a med call that a male was breathing, but unresponsive. When Lt.

Higbie spoke with T.V., who said father was at court that morning and\n\nhad to report to jail later that day. Mother arrived and was told father overdosed again.\n\nShe said father was not supposed to hang out with Troy Smith, who trafficked drugs.\n\nFather was revived with Narcan, and wanted to know what was going on. Father was\n\nasked what drugs he took; he said he did not take any drugs. Father was informed that\n\nNarcan only worked on opioid use, not heart attacks, strokes or epilepsy. The lieutenant\n\nlooked for evidence of drugs in the home, but found none. Father refused to go to the\n\nhospital, and was not charged with a crime.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} The lieutenant did not recall being told at the scene that father tested\n\npositive at court that morning for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol. Based on that\n\ninformation, Lt. Higbie believed that father did some type of opioid between the time he\n\nwas in court and the time he became unresponsive.\n\nPatrolman Austin Batt\n\n       {\u00b6 101} The officer was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing.

The officer was advised that mother called,\n\nand she was performing CPR.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} Upon Officer Batt\u2019s arrival at the house, mother said father was dead and\n\nwas blue in the face. She accused father of using an illegal substance that he got at Circle\n\nK. Mother appeared normal but distraught, and she looked frustrated with father as she\n\nbelieved he used illegal drugs and overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The officer found father was alert and conscious, but heavily intoxicated.\n\nFather had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from his breath, there were white\n\ncrystal-like debris hanging out of his nostrils, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, his\n\nspeech was slurred, he was unable to have a conversation, he thought everything was\n\nfunny, he could not maintain his balance, and he had body tremors. Father admitted\n\ndrinking five 24-ounce cans of Milwaukee Ice Beer, but denied taking any illegal\n\nsubstances or overdosing. Father claimed he fell asleep and was epileptic; he did not\n\nmention a blood clot. Father\u2019s heart rate was high, which was an indicator of being under\n\nthe influence of a stimulant like meth or cocaine. Father was not given Narcan and he\n\nrefused to go the hospital. He was not criminally charged, as no drugs or paraphernalia\n\nwere found.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The officer recalled that father\u2019s cousin and a friend were also at the\n\nhouse and they both had indicators that they were under the influence, as they had\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\fbloodshot, glassy eyes, they had body tremors and could not maintain steady balance.\n\nThe cousin said father was unconscious, and the cousin breathed for father.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} Officer Batt believed mother and father were girlfriend and boyfriend, as\n\nthe officer stopped father\u2019s car the previous week for a traffic violation at which time\n\nfather said he was trying to get home, where he lived with mother.\n\nAttorney Abigail Wurm\n\n       {\u00b6 106} Wurm was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was an attorney for the estate of T.V., who died on December 13, 2022.\n\nMother and father lived at T.V.\u2019s home at the time of T.V.\u2019s death. T.V. had a will which\n\nprovided that five beneficiaries, including mother, were to split the estate.\n\n       {\u00b6 107} Mother was advised that she and father could stay at T.V.\u2019s home, and\n\npay the utilities, until mother was able to secure financing to purchase the home. Mother\n\ncould not get a loan, so on January 26, 2023, a thirty-day notice to vacate the home was\n\nserved. At that time, Wurm noticed a door hanger on the house which stated the village\n\nwould shut off utilities as of January 31, 2023. Wurm learned that mother and father had\n\nnot paid the utilities, as they promised. Wurm also learned the utilities were shut off.\n\n       {\u00b6 108} Wurm received verification that mother and father had vacated the home\n\non February 20, 2023; the locks on the home were changed and the home was listed for\n\nsale. When mother and father vacated the home, there was nothing left in the home; the\n\nstove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, all of the appliances were gone.\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\f       {\u00b6 109} Wurm testified that T.V. had a 2003 Chevy Trailblaze which showed up\n\non Facebook on January 23, 2023, as having been sold by father for $250. Wurm was not\n\naware that father had authorization to sell the vehicle, and she knew he did not have a\n\ntitle to the vehicle. A complaint against father was filed with the police department.\n\n       {\u00b6 110} Wurm estimated that mother may receive $15,000 to $18,000 when T.V.\u2019s\n\nestate closed, which was anticipated to be in the fall of 2023.\n\nJana Richards\n\n       {\u00b6 111} Richards was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was a counselor at Shalom Counseling and Mediation Center (\u201cShalom\u201d),\n\nand also was the supervised visitation coordinator and parenting instructor.\n\n       {\u00b6 112} Richards supervised the parents\u2019 visit with the children. Father was\n\nreferred for supervised visits at Shalom in May 2021, mother was referred in June 2021.\n\nRichards was instructed to schedule visits every other week, for two hours, but there were\n\ngaps in the visits due to mother\u2019s inpatient treatment and father\u2019s incarceration and\n\ninability to pay for visits. Visits ended in February 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Richards directed mother\u2019s parenting classes, which started with\n\norientation on April 8, 2021, and ended December 2, 2021, when mother completed the\n\nclasses. The gap between mother\u2019s orientation and classes was due to her positive drug\n\nscreen in late April 2021, and subsequent inpatient treatment.\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f       {\u00b6 114} As for father, he was referred for parenting classes on September 28,\n\n2022, and he completed two out of the ten required classes. After he missed two classes,\n\nhe was \u201cpulled from group and then he would have to start the next cycle.\u201d During\n\nsupervised visits with the children, father mentioned the parenting classes to Richards,\n\nand he was informed that he had to reach out to remind her at another time; he never did.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Richards\u2019 general observations of mother and father\u2019s visits with the\n\nchildren were \u201c[l]ots of love and affection * * * praise and encouragement,\u201d and there\n\nwere no issues with the parents at visits. Richards observed mother applying what she\n\nhad learned in parenting classes at the visits, definitely the positive aspects, although\n\nmother could improve on providing consequences for behaviors. Richards recommended\n\nunsupervised visits for mother and father with the children.\n\nLisa Michel\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Michel was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing.

Mother missed some appointments,\n\nbut it was not enough to be removed from the program, as she always contacted Michel\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fto let her know. Michel had no concerns with mother during her treatment, as every\n\nrecommendation was completed and mother was discharged on April 4, 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Father started services in April or May 2021, and was discharged on\n\nJune 1, 2021. He was in rehab for one day, June 8 to June 9, 2022, and went back, in\n\nOctober 2022, for counseling with Michel and medication assisted treatment (\u201cMET\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Father did well at first with counseling, but then missed appointments.\n\nDuring the fall of 2022 and winter of 2022-2023, he was supposed to go to Guidestone\n\nfour days a week, but from November 2022 through April 2023, he missed 24\n\nappointments and was removed from group. Father was drug screened by Michel twice a\n\nweek; he was positive for THC and alcohol on November 2, 2022, but had negative\n\nscreens thereafter.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} Father was in MET and on Suboxone from October 4, 2022 until\n\nDecember 1, 2022, when he was discharged for noncompliance.

In April 2023, mother told Michel\n\nthat she broke up with father.\n\n       {\u00b6 123} Michel was aware that father allegedly overdosed on January 23, 2023,\n\nand noted that he did not take a drug screen until January 26, 2023. She was asked if she\n\nwould challenge father\u2019s March 23, 2023 testimony, that he was very compliant with\n\nGuidestone and his treatment, as untruthful; Michel responded she would.\n\nJerome Pete Reed\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Reed was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was employed as a certified scientist with Forensic Fluids Laboratory\n\n(\u201cFFL\u201d), which specialized in oral fluid drug testing. He mentioned that drugs in the\n\nblood also affect saliva. Reed stated it was virtually impossible for FFL\u2019s tests to have a\n\nfalse positive. He also said you could not test positive for meth if you sat next to a user,\n\nkissed or had sex with a user.\n\n       {\u00b6 125} Reed recalled that FFL processed drug tests for mother, as requested by\n\nthe agency, and there were three positive results: on April 29, 2020, positive for oxy; and\n\non April 19 and May 28, 2021, positive for meth and amphet. He explained that the body\n\ntried to excrete meth by converting it to amphet, and with ADHD drugs, like Adderall, a\n\ndrug test would also be positive for amphet. Reed noted meth use could be detected in\n\noral fluid for up to about 18 hours.\n\n\n\n\n32.\n\f        {\u00b6 126} FFL processed drug tests for father, as requested by the agency, with the\n\nfollowing positive results: on May 10, 2021, positive for THC; on May 21, 2021, positive\n\nfor meth, amphet, THC, cocaine, Benzoylecgonine (\u201cBZE\u201d) and Ecgonine Methyl Ester\n\n(\u201cEME\u201d); on June 4, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC; on October 5, 2021,\n\npositive for THC; and on October 14, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC. Reed\n\nexplained that the body broke down cocaine into BZE, and then EME.\n\n        {\u00b6 127} Reed noted the medications father listed for November 2, 2021, were oxy\n\nand enoxaparin (which is a blood thinner, not used for epilepsy), yet father\u2019s drug test\n\nwas positive for meth, amphet and THC; no listed medications were found. On\n\nNovember 19, and December 16, 2021, father was positive for meth, amphet and THC;\n\non December 27, 2021, he was positive for Percocet (which is oxy), meth, amphet and\n\nTHC; on May 4, September 13 and October 26, 2022, he was positive for THC; and on\n\nMarch 23, 2023, father was positive for fentanyl.\n\n        {\u00b6 128} Reed explained that fentanyl use could be detected in oral fluid for up to\n\nabout 24 hours, and THC (by smoking marijuana) can be detected for up to 36 hours.\n\n        {\u00b6 129} Reed noted father had one negative result, which was on December 15,\n\n2022.\n\n        {\u00b6 130} Reed observed that it took an extensive amount of time of chronic drug\n\nuse to register a positive in a hair follicle test. Chronic drug usage would be several times\n\na week for several months before the drug would register on a hair follicle test.\n\n\n\n\n33.\n\fMelinda Reynolds\n\n        {\u00b6 131} Reynolds was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony she offered at the March 23, 2023 hearing on parents\u2019\n\nmotion to dismiss.

She admitted that father used THC, but\n\nclaimed no other substances were used in the home. On May 12, 2020, mother claimed\n\nshe did not realize she was in active labor so she took two Percocets for pain, and in the\n\nhospital, she was given oxy every six hours.\n\n\n\n\n34.\n\f       {\u00b6 134} Mother sent the agency an email on May 2, 2020, indicating she was not\n\ntogether with father, and he moved to Kentucky, as his other children were \u201cbeing\n\nadopted out.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 135} On May 28, 2020, mother was drug tested by the agency, and was positive\n\nfor meth and amphet; she denied ever using meth.

On September 28, 2020, mother indicated that father was back in\n\ntown. On October 13, 2020, mother reported that father moved out and moved into his\n\nmother\u2019s house in Defiance, Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 138} On December 11, 2020, mother reported she bought a trailer and would\n\nmove in January 2021, which she did. On March 1, 2021, mother reported she had been\n\nback and forth between T.V.\u2019s home and the trailer, as she was working on getting the\n\nbathroom fixed. On April 22, 2021, a caseworker went to the trailer unannounced and\n\nfather opened the door; he became upset, refused a drug screen and refused to work with\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\fthe caseworker. On October 28, 2021, the agency learned that mother did not own the\n\ntrailer and that she moved to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 139} On October 26, 2022, father notified the agency that he lived with mother\n\nin T.V.\u2019s home and was no longer living in the trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 140} A March 25, 2023 police report indicated that mother and father were\n\nliving together on Vine Street in Sherwood, Ohio, but on April 17, 2023, father emailed\n\nthe agency that he was moving to Lexington, Kentucky. On April 21, 2023, mother\n\nreported that she did not live at T.V.\u2019s home; she stayed with friends or family or in her\n\ncar. Mother\u2019s address was requested for eight weeks, and the day before the May 19,\n\n2023 trial, mother emailed a signed a lease for the Vine Street trailer (\u201cVine trailer\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 141} Reynolds noted the agency only communicated with father via email, as\n\nthere were occasions when he was very threatening with a caseworker. Reynolds had not\n\nemailed father since April 2023, because he had responded to her emails with \u201cLOL\u201d\n\nwhen she asked him for his address or where he was. The day before trial, Reynolds saw\n\nthat father\u2019s Facebook post said he was in Fremont, Ohio.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 142} Reynolds was not able to conduct home visits in March, April or May,\n\n2023, for mother or father.\n\n\n\n\n36.\n\fEmployment\n\n      {\u00b6 143} Mother reported that she received $400 a month in SSDI, and the children\n\nalso received SSDI, which money was redirected to the agency. Reynolds believed that if\n\nmother had housing and the children were returned to her, she would get over $1,000 per\n\nmonth.\n\n      {\u00b6 144} Father reported, on May 24, 2021, that he worked at Mansion\u2019s; he\n\nprovided no verification. On October 4, 2021, he told the caseworker he received SSDI\n\nand did side jobs, and on October 15, 2021, he reported that he worked in Michigan; he\n\nprovided no verification. On November 25, 2021, he reported he injured his leg and was\n\nnot working.\n\n      {\u00b6 145} On May 4, 2022, father claimed he worked at a tire place by the Ford\n\ndealer in Bryan, Ohio; he provided no verification. On July 15, 2022, he indicated he\n\nworked at an oil change place in town; he provided no verification. In August 2022,\n\nfather was in jail and did not work. In November 2022, the agency received proof that\n\nfather collected SSDI.\n\n      {\u00b6 146} On January 23, 2023, father reported that he worked at CK Technologies;\n\nhe showed his ID badge and confirmed his employment.\n\n\n\n\n37.\n\fPRC Application\n\n        {\u00b6 147} Mother completed her application; it was approved in June 2021. Father\n\nwas given six applications before he completed one, which was approved in November\n\n2022.\n\nVisitation and Parenting Classes\n\n        {\u00b6 148} There were no issues with parents\u2019 supervised visits with the children,\n\nexcept that mother struggled to follow through with discipline. The agency gave the\n\nparents gas vouchers for visits with the children. By February 2023, parents were\n\nallowed additional visits, which were supervised by the foster mom. Mother was very\n\nrespectful with the foster parents, and father typically did not interact with them.\n\n        {\u00b6 149} Reynolds noted that generally when reunification is the goal, parents\n\nstarted with supervised visits, then moved to unsupervised visits to transition their\n\nchildren back into the home before their children returned home. However, mother and\n\nfather always had supervised visits because, throughout the case, mother was dishonest\n\nwith the agency about her relationship with father, so she did not build trust with the\n\nagency. Reynolds was aware that in January 2023, a joint motion was filed by the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s office requesting unsupervised visits for the parents, which showed it was\n\nnot the agency\u2019s decision for the parents to have supervised visits with the children.\n\n\n\n\n38.\n\f       {\u00b6 150} Mother attended and completed all required parenting classes by\n\nDecember 2021, while father attended two classes out of ten and never completed the\n\nparenting class goal.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 151} The agency required visits with the parents every month, with home visits\n\nevery other month, some of which were unannounced; it was mandated that the agency\n\nmake three attempts a month for a home visit. The other visits were held at the agency or\n\na neutral site.\n\n       {\u00b6 152} For mother, home visits were unsuccessful in May and November 2022\n\nand February 2023, while visits were successful in July and December 2022 and January\n\n2023, but two attempts were be made before visits occurred. No home visits were\n\nattempted in March, April and May 2023, because mother did not provide her address to\n\nthe agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 153} With father, home visits were not successful in September, October,\n\nNovember and December 2020; January, April and July 2021; April, June and December\n\n2022; and January, February and April 2023.\n\nSubstance Abuse, Drug Screens and Mental Health Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 154} In November 2020, mother engaged in treatment at Recovery, disengaged\n\nin February 2021, and reengaged in March 2021. She was accepted at FIC in February\n\n2021. FIC was an intensive program, with four phases, starting with weekly meetings\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fbetween the parent and a treatment team of providers, which included the agency\u2019s\n\ndirector, then meeting every other week, then every three weeks, and finally, a meeting\n\nevery four weeks until the parent graduated and was discharged from the program.\n\nMother was unsuccessfully discharged from FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 155} In April 2021, mother was admitted for inpatient treatment at Serenity. In\n\nMay 2021, it was reported to the agency that mother was having regular contact with\n\nfather, she did not follow the rules when it came to father, and she appeared very co-\n\ndependent. In August 2021, mother was successfully discharged from Serenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 156} Mother tested positive for meth on September 1, 2021, but denied using;\n\nshe claimed she had sex with father the night before, which made the test positive. She\n\nalso was positive for meth on September 22, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 157} In December 2021, a contempt hearing was held because mother was\n\ntested by FIC and was positive for meth, twice. She was found in contempt and ordered\n\nto attend inpatient treatment.\n\n       {\u00b6 158} Mother was admitted to Serenity again, in January 2022, and released in\n\nApril 2022. On July 7 and 15, 2022, Recovery tested mother and she was positive for\n\nmeth; she denied using drug, and claimed her drink was spiked by her sister. In late\n\nSeptember 2022, mother informed the agency she switched services to Guidestone, and\n\nno longer wanted to go to Recovery or complete inpatient treatment. In April 2023,\n\nmother successfully completed treatment at Guidestone and was discharged.\n\n\n\n\n40.\n\f       {\u00b6 159} Father was assessed at Guidestone, in April 2021, and IOP was\n\nrecommended, but he failed to follow the recommendation. Father was referred to FIC, a\n\nmeeting was scheduled but he did not appear. Father was denied admission into FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 160} In October 2021, father was assessed at Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; treatment was recommended. Father was discharged from\n\nRecovery in December 2021, due to lack of attendance.\n\n       {\u00b6 161} In January 2022, father requested to be removed from the case plan, as he\n\nwas facing contempt charges; he was removed. In March 2022, father asked to be placed\n\nback on the case plan; he was added to the case plan. The caseworker told father the\n\nagency wanted him to go to inpatient treatment, but he said he did not have time to do\n\nthat. Father also said he never wanted to be on the case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 162} In April 2022, father had another assessment at Guidestone and residential\n\ntreatment was recommended; he refused to go saying that place does not help and there\n\nare more drugs there than on the streets. In June 2022, father went to inpatient for one\n\nday, then disengaged from services until he was assessed again at Guidestone in October\n\n2022. IOP was recommended, but father quit attending all services in March 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 163} Father refused to drug test for the agency in: August 2020; April 2021;\n\nMarch 2022; and January 2023, following the alleged overdose.\n\n\n\n\n41.\n\f                                   Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 164} Mother and father claimed on numerous occasions that they were not in a\n\nrelationship, but the agency believed otherwise. When mother was in Serenity for the\n\nfirst time in the spring of 2021, she had contact with father and it appeared, at that time,\n\nthat she had no intention of ending her relationship with him. In August 2021, mother\n\nindicated to the agency she had broken up with father, but in a jail video from\n\nSeptember 23, 2021, she told father she was going to tell the court what it wanted to hear,\n\nwhich was that they broke up, but she had no intention of breaking up and throwing away\n\nfive years.\n\n       {\u00b6 165} On October 15, 2021, mother told the agency she and father were together\n\nand possibly moving to Michigan. On December 3, 2021, mother reported that she had\n\nbroken up with father, and on April 6, 2022, she said she was finished with him for good.\n\n       {\u00b6 166} On April 26, 2022, the agency received a police report stating that father\n\nwas charged with falsification for pawning a gun in Defiance, Ohio. Father indicated to\n\nthe officer that the gun belonged to his girlfriend (mother), but he pawned it because she\n\ndid not have her license on her at the time. Later, father requested the gun back and filled\n\nout an ATF form which reflected that he had no previous misdemeanor domestic violence\n\ncharges, but father had a domestic violence conviction in Bryan, Ohio, and it was\n\npresumed that mother was the victim. Reynolds knew it was illegal, under federal law,\n\nfor father to own a firearm. Father admitted that he lied on the form, and faced charges.\n\n\n\n\n42.\n\fReynolds was concerned that father had a firearm, as he had made threats against the\n\ncourt and the agency, saying he would blow that place up and they are all going to pay; it\n\nwas unclear to which place father was referring. Reynolds also learned of domestic\n\nviolence accusations made against father in Kentucky by his other children\u2019s mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 167} Reynolds noted that the parents were seen together at Wal-Mart in April\n\n2022, father asked the children at a visit if they saw the puppy that he and mother bought\n\ntogether, and through most of the case, mother used father\u2019s last name on Facebook.\n\n       {\u00b6 168} Mother was told at the March 23, 2023 hearing that if she was not with\n\nfather, she could potentially have the children returned to her. Father had a Facebook\n\npost saying he and mother had broken up and were living separately. However, Reynolds\n\nlearned from father\u2019s mother that from March through May 2023, the parents lived\n\ntogether.\n\n                                 Parents\u2019 Other Children\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Mother has two older children, and one child\u2019s biological father had legal\n\ncustody.\n\n       {\u00b6 170} Father had two older children, but his parental rights were involuntarily\n\nterminated for these children in August 2020, in Kentucky.\n\n                                     Foster Parents\n\n       {\u00b6 171} The children were the same foster parents since the emergency removal in\n\nDecember 2021. The children were happy, settled and very bonded with the foster\n\n\n\n\n43.\n\fparents, they go on vacations together. The children have their own beds, own rooms,\n\nown toys and own clothes at the foster home. The foster parents wished to adopt the\n\nchildren. The foster parents communicated with X.H.\u2019s foster parents and the children\n\nhave regular contact with X.H., which would continue if the agency were granted\n\npermanent custody of the children.\n\n                                        Opinions\n\n       {\u00b6 172} Reynolds opined it would be disruptive to the children, especially M.M.,\n\nif there were a placement change. In Reynolds\u2019 training she learned that every move for\n\na child was traumatizing, and children who were disrupted constantly or had placement\n\nchanges were more likely to have mental health issues, more likely to struggle in school,\n\nand less likely to go to college.\n\n       {\u00b6 173} Reynolds\u2019 opined it would be in the children\u2019s best interests for them to\n\nbe placed in the permanent custody of the agency, and for the permanency goal to be\n\nchanged to adoption. Reynolds believed if the children were returned to mother, CPS\n\nwould likely have to continue its involvement, and the children would continue to have\n\nplacement disruptions and changes. The children needed a legally secure, permanent\n\nplacement.\n\nThomas Custer\n\n       {\u00b6 174} Tom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was father\u2019s stepfather and was married to Debbie Custer, father\u2019s mother,\n\n\n\n\n44.\n\ffor 14 years. Tom did not know the children well, he thought M.M. may know him and\n\nDebbie, but B.M. had only been to the Custer home twice. The Custers did not have\n\nvisits with the children while they were in foster care, because \u201cit was two (2) years\n\nbefore we even knew they were there.\u201d Tom learned the children were in foster care two\n\nor three months prior to trial when the agency contacted him and Debbie about taking\n\ncustody. Tom said he and Debbie were older and had too many health issues to run after\n\nand raise little kids.\n\n       {\u00b6 175} The Custers had a close acquaintance-type relationship with mother, and\n\nTom thought she was a good parent. Tom has a \u201clabored\u201d relationship with father; if\n\nfather got what he wanted, he was good to be around, but if father got mad, he was a\n\nwhole different person - angry and making threats. Tom tried to keep his distance from\n\nfather, as father threatened to beat Tom up, mop the floor with him and put him in a pine\n\nbox. Tom said he and his wife were not afraid of father, Tom just does not want the\n\ndrama. Tom recalled that father said the Defiance Police stopped by, and father talked\n\nwith them.\n\n       {\u00b6 176} Tom remembered that from January 2023, until about a month ago when\n\nthe Custers told the agency they would not take the children, mother and father were at\n\nthe Custer home two or three times a week, and father came out one time without mother.\n\nTom said mother and father took showers at the Custer home. After father was notified\n\n\n\n\n45.\n\fthat the Custers would not take the children, he threatened Debbie, so she blocked him on\n\nthe phone and everything.\n\n        {\u00b6 177} In about April 2023, when mother called Debbie and asked for Narcan,\n\nTom overheard the call. Mother said she was out and when she got home, she found\n\nfather comatose and she did not know what he did or took. Debbie told mother to take\n\nfather to the hospital or call 911. A few hours later, mother and father arrived at the\n\nCuster home and father had slurred speech, \u201ca little balance,\u201d and was under the influence\n\nof something. Tom said father drank, but did not admit to doing drugs. Tom said he\n\ndoes not believe that father knew what the word \u201chonesty\u201d meant, as father had a\n\ndelusional version of the truth. Tom said father had five children, with three women.\n\nTom thought father knew how to manipulate mother, and was good at it.\n\n        {\u00b6 178} Tom saw mother the day before trial when she came out to the Custer\n\nhome to retrieve the children\u2019s clothes, dressers, car seats and things. The items were at\n\nT.V.\u2019s home, but were moved to the Custer home when mother and father left T.V.\u2019s\n\nhome.\n\n        {\u00b6 179} Tom saw and talked to father the morning of trial, at the Vine trailer.\n\nTom went to get his ladder and rake which he lent to father, as \u201cthere was a big falling\n\nout.\u201d Tom and his brother found the Vine trailer because a dresser mother picked up the\n\nnight before \u201csat right there.\u201d The two men went to the back door, which was unlocked,\n\n\n\n\n46.\n\fand opened it; the brother said someone was inside, so Tom looked and father \u201cpopped\n\nout and he started doing the [father] thing.\u201d Father said he just woke up.\n\n       {\u00b6 180} Tom told the prosecutor, when he talked to her the previous weekend, that\n\nmother and father were still together, and lived together on Vine Street. However, when\n\nTom spoke to mother the night before trial, she said father left.\n\n       {\u00b6 181} Tom does not know what mother and father\u2019s living arrangement was, but\n\nfather told Tom that he and mother had slept in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Father said\n\nmother bought a trailer after T.V. died, and father was fixing it up. Tom said after T.V.\n\npassed away and mother and father had to move out of T.V.\u2019s home \u201cthe world flipped\n\nupside down.\u201d Mother and father asked to stay at the Custer home and were told no,\n\nalthough Tom said mother was welcome anytime, but without father.\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Tom talked to mother the day of trial during a smoke break, and she asked\n\nTom what father was doing at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 183} Tom believed the children should be returned to mother, but should not be\n\nreturned to father.\n\nFoster mom\n\n       {\u00b6 184} Foster mom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to\n\nthe following. She was a married, third-grade teacher and her husband was a pipefitter.\n\nThe children have lived with the foster parents for one and a half years; M.M. was three\n\nyears old and B.M. was one when they entered foster care. At first, M.M. cried a lot and\n\n\n\n\n47.\n\fit took time for her to get used to the foster parents and daycare centers, but she really\n\nimproved. B.M. was a go-with-the-flow kid, so the transition was easier for him.\n\n       {\u00b6 185} M.M. was silly and all girl, and she liked to do girl stuff with foster mom.\n\nM.M. and foster dad were the silliest together, as foster dad was the play around person,\n\nand M.M. loved to hang out with him. M.M. was really loving with the foster parents, as\n\nwas B.M., who was also very cuddly. The children loved to go outside to play with\n\nfoster dad, they rode bikes and scooters, played and hiked in the woods, took the dog for\n\na walk, and swam and went to the zoo in the summer.\n\n       {\u00b6 186} The children improved a lot, especially their speech, as the foster parents\n\nworked with them since they arrived. Daycare helped the children improve socially and\n\nalso helped their speech. The children were really good with other kids. B.M. was in\n\nHead Start, and the children both had IEPs for speech at their school in Bowling Green.\n\n       {\u00b6 187} Foster mom was pregnant with her first child. The children are treated as\n\npart of the foster family, they were very bonded to each other, they played really well\n\ntogether for the most part, and slept in the same room, as they did not want to be\n\nseparated.\n\n       {\u00b6 188} The foster parents wanted to adopt the children, as they were a part of the\n\nfamily for almost two years, and the foster parents were definitely comfortable keeping\n\nthe children long-term.\n\n\n\n\n48.\n\f       {\u00b6 189} Foster mom believed if M.M. were disrupted again and moved around,\n\nback and forth, it would be hard and confusing on her to adjust to different settings. With\n\nB.M., foster mom would be concerned about his behavior, because when B.M. met\n\nsomeone new at daycare, he had behaviors, but \u201cafter they kind of get his number, he\u2019s\n\nbetter.\u201d Foster mom was worried that B.M. would develop poor behaviors if he was\n\naround different adults and had to go back and forth.\n\n       {\u00b6 190} Recently, foster mom supervised visits between the children and mother\n\nand father; foster mom and mother made the arrangements. Outside of visits, foster mom\n\nhad no contact with father. The visits were roughly every two weeks for two hours or so,\n\nat a place like the park or McDonald\u2019s. Mother was very loving towards the children and\n\nthey were excited to see her, but they got a little wild and hyped-up with father, which\n\nwas not that concerning. The children were bonded with mother and father, and talked\n\nabout them all of the time. X.H. was also at visits, as his foster parent brought him. The\n\nchildren loved to see X.H., and he was very sweet and caring to them. X.H. came to\n\nB.M.\u2019s birthday party at the foster home, and was really great with the kids. If the foster\n\nparents adopted the children, visits with X.H. would continue. Foster mom believed the\n\nchildren needed consistency and that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain with\n\nthe foster parents permanently.\n\n\n\n\n49.\n\f                   Permanent Custody Trial - Day 2, May 22, 2023\n\nGAL\n\n       {\u00b6 191} GAL Cook was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony he offered at previous hearings. The GAL also testified\n\nthat the children needed a legally secure, permanent placement, and permanent removal\n\nfrom mother and father was probably in the children\u2019s best interests, as were permanent\n\ncustody and adoption.\n\nMelinda Reynolds\n\n       {\u00b6 192} Reynolds testified about the children\u2019s previous placements with family\n\nmembers, and the efforts made to try to place the children permanently or long-term with\n\nrelatives.\n\nMother\n\n       {\u00b6 193} Mother testified to the following.\n\n                                  Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 194} Around the time of B.M.\u2019s birth, mother and father were off and on, and\n\nnot \u201csolely together.\u201d After B.M. was born, father took off. She was unaware that father\n\nhad his parental rights to two children terminated in 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 195} Mother acknowledged that some time before the September 2021 jail\n\nphone call between her and father, she was probably told she should not be with father if\n\nshe wanted the children back.\n\n\n\n\n50.\n\f       {\u00b6 196} In the fall of 2022, mother was on and off with father, and \u201call I wanted to\n\ndo was give him the benefit of the doubt and change for his children. * * * I like stayed\n\naway for a while and he kept coming back saying oh he\u2019s going to change. You know\n\nhe\u2019s going to do this, he\u2019s going to do that, but * * * he never did.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 197} At the March 2023 court hearing, mother told father \u201cif you fail this drug\n\nscreen, I\u2019m done. Like I\u2019m done done. I can\u2019t do it no more. * * * I\u2019m tired of looking at\n\nsomebody that\u2019s saying you know that they\u2019re clean and sober to my face but in reality\n\nthey\u2019re lying. I\u2019m done with it.\u201d She claimed that she ended her relationship with father\n\n\u201c[a] few days later after I got the positive drug screen from [the agency].\u201d She admitted\n\nshe was a little fearful that father may hurt her, as \u201che\u2019s made threats to me as well in the\n\npast but nothing you know, physical really. * * * I want to invest in pepper spray just in\n\ncase if something was to happen. I don\u2019t want no firearm, no nothing you know that\n\ncould be potentially dangerous for my children to be in reach of.\u201d When asked about the\n\ngun that father sold, she admitted it was her gun but claimed she did not have much to do\n\nwith it, since she was in Serenity at the time.\n\n       {\u00b6 198} Mother was asked about the foster mom\u2019s testimony that for the last two\n\nvisits, mother and father arrived together; she replied, \u201cNo. The last visit which was on\n\nthe * * * (12th) I was there waiting on [the foster mom.] [Father] wasn\u2019t even there.\n\n[M.M.] asked where her daddy was and I said I didn\u2019t know. About * * * (5) minutes\n\nlater he come walking up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n51.\n\f       {\u00b6 199} Mother was asked about Facebook messenger and text messages between\n\nher and father; she said there were no texts and she messaged him on Facebook to \u201csend\n\nhim odd jobs, that\u2019s it. On Facebook. You know try to help him make money that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nShe did not know the last time she messaged him \u201c[c]ause my phone, I don\u2019t have\n\ninternet so when I get internet, like in Sherwood it spaces out and I something I click one\n\nperson and it pops up another person. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m about to just get rid of the\n\nphone completely and go back to flip phone.\u201d She claimed she did not have internet on\n\nher phone or at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 200} Mother was asked if she married father, as indicated on Facebook, and she\n\nreplied, \u201cNo, absolutely not. * * * At one point we were engaged [in 2017]. The whole\n\nsituation with Facebook and my name. I was illiterate. I\u2019m not going to lie. I could not\n\nfor the life of me figure out how to change my last name back to [her maiden name]. But\n\nthat is my legal name.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 201} Mother claimed the domestic violence committed against her by father in\n\n2018 \u201cwas more verbal. It wasn\u2019t physical.\u201d Father was ordered by the court to have no\n\nviolent or threatening contact with mother and to complete Thinking for a Change, and he\n\nwas placed on probation, which he unsuccessfully completed.\n\n                                           Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 202} At the time of trial, S.O., was in JRC [Juvenile Residential Center] in\n\nBowling Green; mother thought he was charged with \u201crape one * * *. And I don\u2019t know\n\n\n\n\n52.\n\fif it was gross sexual.\u201d She believed the victim lived in the home with S.O. Mother\n\ntalked to S.O. \u201conce a week. I video Zoom him when my internet wants to work once a\n\nweek and I can see him once a week in person.\u201d She did not see S.O. every week\n\n\u201cconsidering it\u2019s an hour away and my funding is kind of short because of everything\n\nright now but I do go see him when I can.\u201d She had not seen S.O. in person for three\n\nweeks.\n\n         {\u00b6 203} Mother stated she had every intention of starting unsupervised visits with\n\nthe children, maybe in October 2022, when T.V. was still alive. She was ready for the\n\nchildren, as \u201cI had the beds made. I had the beds put together. Everything for\n\n[caseworker Alaina] to come check it out to start doing unsupervised visits. I never once\n\ngot an email, call, anything for her to say hey I\u2019m not able to make it to get these\n\nunsupervised visits.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 204} Mother was asked if she picked up father for parenting time, and she said\n\nshe did not and she also did not tell him when the visits were, but \u201c[w]ith my car issues\n\nlike when I go to Bowling Green or even you know, from Sherwood to Bryan I let\n\nsomebody know where I\u2019m going and usually it\u2019s a third party that relays the message to\n\nhim.\u201d\n\n                                         Home Visits\n\n         {\u00b6 205} Testimony was presented that it was sometimes difficult to reach mother,\n\nto which she responded, \u201c[i]n November my grandpa was diagnosed with SCLC which is\n\n\n\n\n53.\n\fsmall cell lung cancer in June of * * * (2022). From that day until December * * * (13th)\n\nthe day that he had passed away, I was his sole provider, caretaker. * * * So like when\n\nthey were to come to the house, I could have very well been in Toledo with my grandpa\n\nfor his [chemo] treatment.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 206} Mother was asked who took care of T.V. while she was in jail for 30 days\n\nin August and September 2022, and she replied, \u201c[m]y mom would come and check in,\n\nyou know every couple days. I talked to him on the phone every day just to make sure,\n\nyou know, he was still okay.\u201d\n\n                                       Employment\n\n       {\u00b6 207} Mother did not have a job, but \u201cI try to do whatever I can, like on the side\n\nas like a gig job just to get extra money.\u201d She helped people with yard pick-up and she\n\nbabysat. Mother\u2019s only health problem was her back, which limited her employment\n\noptions because she could not stand for long periods of time.\n\n                                     Drugs/Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 208} Mother was questioned about hospital records which indicated B.M.\n\nshowed signs of withdrawal at birth and she tested positive for oxy, meth and amphet, but\n\nshe denied drug use. She said \u201c[t]hey never asked me.\u201d She admitted that she used drugs\n\nduring her pregnancy \u201c[j]ust one time. That was it. One time. * * * And honestly I think\n\nthat\u2019s what put me into labor. Because he wasn\u2019t supposed to be due till actually May * *\n\n* (19th).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n54.\n\f       {\u00b6 209} As to positive drug screens, mother said, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a lot of honesty *\n\n* * throughout this case. I did make a poor choice. * * * I don\u2019t have a desire to even go\n\nback to that [drug use].\u201d She acknowledged she went to Serenity twice for inpatient\n\ntreatment, and went back the second time \u201c[b]ecause I failed another drug screen.\u201d She\n\nsaid the second time was helpful as she was able to work on her mental state to get out of\n\nthe extreme depression and high anxiety that she had.\n\n       {\u00b6 210} Mother claimed she had a rough time with FIC and felt like she went\n\nnowhere, so she failed to complete it.\n\n       {\u00b6 211} Mother called Debbie (father\u2019s mother) in or about April 2023, and asked\n\nfor Narcan for father who was \u201c[n]ot horribly\u201d comatose, as his eyes were open and \u201che\n\ncould walk but not a whole lot.\u201d Mother stated that earlier that day, they went to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201chad a really bad headache and she [Debbie] gave him medicine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was. I don\u2019t know anything because I wasn\u2019t even in that room. * *\n\n* Then we left and later on I called. For Narcan because I don\u2019t know what she gave\n\nhim. Obviously, she\u2019s got Narcan for a reason. Is it something she gave, did she give\n\nhim her medication? * * * I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mother did not call 911, although she drove\n\nfather to the hospital, but he would not get out of the car. Then, they returned to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201cwas completely fine. Like his speech was still a little slurred.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n55.\n\f       {\u00b6 212} Mother admitted she used meth, as \u201cI, you know I have went through\n\ndown a rough path of like emotional distraught, physical, mental and like, I worked my\n\nway out of that to be where I am right now.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 213} Mother also admitted that the agency helped her quite a bit, as the agency\n\nwas \u201cworking with me to try and save my children. The only thing like I get would be\n\nlike the proper housing and more assistance. Like I only get * * * ($23) a month in food\n\nstamps. Half of my check is gone because of my kids, paying for them. How am I\n\nsupposed to even, but I do that\u2019s why I try to get any kind of side job I can make a little\n\nextra money for. And put it towards bills or extra food or something. But I\u2019m going to\n\nreapply for food stamps * * * today. * * * You know I hit up the food banks, I\u2019m not\n\nashamed to hit up you know a food bank.\u201d\n\n                                     Alleged Overdoses\n\n       {\u00b6 214} Regarding the December 2019 incident, mother said she was present, as\n\nwas T.V., S.O., X.H. and M.M. After she found father on the bedroom floor, not\n\nbreathing and blue she \u201cwas on the phone. I had by daughter cause like I was freaking\n\nout. I had my daughter she was screaming in one * * * ear, I was on the phone with 911\n\non the other ear and my grandpa yelled for [S.O.] to come in and help him [with CPR].\u201d\n\nMother said S.O. was traumatized, but \u201cat the same time he was like mom I just saved\n\nsomebody\u2019s life. I\u2019m like, I understand that but I mean you really shouldn\u2019t have to,\n\nyou\u2019re only you know * * * (12) years old. * * * Or younger at the time.\u201d She did not\n\n\n\n\n56.\n\fbelieve that X.H. saw father, as X.H. was in the living room with her. Mother told the\n\npolice that father used heroin in the past. After father was revived, he claimed he was\n\njust sleeping and had a sleeping disorder, which mother said was \u201c[a] little bit of sleep\n\napnea, not like a whole lot.\u201d Mother now believed that father overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 215} As to the January 23, 2023 incident, mother admitted father drank and\n\nwent to the gas station with his cousin and wife. About 15 minutes after they got home,\n\nmother was told to call 911 because father was not breathing. She called 911 and\n\naccused father of overdosing, but she said \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have accused him but I\n\nmean, I didn\u2019t know what else to do or think or say. And it just kind of like, I just\n\nreframed back to before.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 216} Mother claimed the people with father \u201cactually are on medication. There\n\nwere not on anything,\u201d and they did CPR on father, but \u201cno Narcan was used that time.\n\nNothing was.\u201d She believed father told the police that he had epilepsy. Mother honestly\n\ndid not know if the January 2023 incident was an overdose.\n\n                                          Housing\n\n       {\u00b6 217} Mother moved out of T.V.\u2019s home in early February 2023, and admitted\n\nthat she took the appliances because: the washer was old and \u201ccould break down at any\n\ngiven time\u201d; she helped to buy the dryer in 2010; the stove was bought in 2005, so it was\n\nan older appliance; and she paid for most of the refrigerator, which was scratched and\n\ndented and smashed on the one side.\n\n\n\n\n57.\n\f       {\u00b6 218} Mother was asked why she did not correct father\u2019s testimony, given at the\n\nMarch 2023 hearing, that they still lived at T.V.\u2019s home, and she replied, \u201cI, I should\n\nhave, I know. But it was more of like a pride thing. Like I\u2019m here on behalf of my kids I\n\ndon\u2019t want anything more used against me and being in a motel obviously wasn\u2019t a\n\ncredential to have my, get my children back. Cause you know like I don\u2019t want to\n\njeopardize more than what I have already lost. * * * I was kind of like in a stuck\n\nposition.\u201d Mother and father were at the motel for about two months.\n\n       {\u00b6 219} The first week or two of April 2023, mother and father looked for a place\n\nto live, found the Vine trailer online and \u201c[t]he guy was trying to give it away or for it to\n\nbe moved and we talked him into just renting it. * * * Because it was too old to be\n\nmoved.\u201d Mother and father were going to get the Vine trailer together, but they had a big\n\nargument, and he took off so she took it over. Mother produced a copy of the Vine trailer\n\nlease, effective May 1, 2023, which she signed the previous week although the lease was\n\ndated April 7, 2023, \u201cwhen we had started working on it and I had started you know\n\nputting more and more into getting it fixed up.\u201d Mother did not put any money into the\n\nVine trailer as the landlord paid for everything.\n\n       {\u00b6 220} Concerning the Vine trailer, prior to May 1, 2023, mother claimed she\n\npaid a $500 deposit and $500 rent \u201c[b]y saving and doing these odd, odd jobs for people.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged she only received $400 in SSDI.\n\n\n\n\n58.\n\f       {\u00b6 221} Mother was asked about a police report that stated on April 12, 2023,\n\nfather was at the Vine trailer. She claimed she was in Bryan, Ohio at that time and had\n\nno idea that the police were there. She later stated that she called the sheriff, upon advice\n\nof counsel, and the police \u201ctrespassed\u201d father. She said father did not have a key, but\n\n\u201c[t]he back door doesn\u2019t really lock so all you have to do * * * is just turn it, but I fully\n\nintend on getting that fixed. By getting a new door. Like this week.\u201d Mother claimed\n\nthat she did not know father was at the Vine trailer because \u201cwe had no heat there at the\n\ntime. I was hardly there.\u201d Mother did not agree with Tom\u2019s testimony that as of last\n\nweekend, she and father lived together at the Vine trailer, nor did she agree that she and\n\nfather went to the Custer home together, until about a month ago.\n\n       {\u00b6 222} Mother was asked about stable housing and replied, \u201cIt does seem like\n\nyou know, I, I was bouncing around you know for a little bit. But one thing that even\n\nbefore this started, my kids had stability. I had my own place before any of this case\n\neven started. And then I moved in with my grandpa briefly and then I moved to\n\nFreemont, Ohio where I had my own place. I moved back because my grandpa got\n\nlonely. * * * When I got this place in Bryan [the trailer], yea, it took a lot of money * * *\n\nto fix it up. But at the end of the day I still had a home to go to which was my grandpa\u2019s.\n\nThe kids had a home to go to. A safe, proper, suitable home. When he passed away you\n\nknow it interrupted a lot of things in life * * * [a]nd I freaked out. I was staying * * * at a\n\nmotel, * * * [in] the car sometimes you know friends, but you know as of right now I\n\n\n\n\n59.\n\fhave a home. I don\u2019t intend on losing that home.\u201d Mother recognized that the\n\ncaseworker and GAL did not visit the Vine trailer, because they were unaware where she\n\nlived, as she \u201chad just got the place. I wanted to make sure it was up to their * * *\n\nstandards before I contacted anyone.\u201d\n\n                      Juvenile Court\u2019s Finding \u2013 Mother\u2019s Motion\n\n       {\u00b6 223} At the end of the second day of trial, the court denied mother\u2019s motion to\n\nreturn custody of the children to her.\n\n                                GAL Filing - June 2, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 224} Closing Argument/Proposed Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law were\n\nfiled by GAL Cook.\n\n                    Permanent Custody Trial - Day 3, June 5, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 225} Witnesses were called to testify regarding X.H.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 4, June 30, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 226} No witnesses were called to testify. The court addressed the issues\n\nregarding the procedural timetable and the GAL\u2019s lack of adherence to Sup.R. 48, with\n\nrespect to X.H. The court found X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity to be included in the case\n\nplan was insufficient, thus the court denied the permanent custody motion as to X.H. only\n\nand dismissed X.H.\u2019s case.\n\n\n\n\n60.\n\f                                 Permanent Custody Law\n\n       {\u00b6 227} A juvenile court\u2019s decision in a permanent custody case will not be\n\nreversed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In re A.H.,\n\n6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1057, 2011-Ohio-4857, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe underlying rationale of\n\ngiving deference to the findings of the trial court rests with the knowledge that the trial\n\njudge is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice\n\ninflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered\n\ntestimony.\u201d Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273\n\n(1984). Furthermore, \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption must be made in favor of the\n\njudgment and the findings of facts [of the trial court].\u201d Karches v. Cincinnati, 38 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 12, 19, 526 N.E.2d 1350 (1988). Thus, a judgment supported by some competent,\n\ncredible evidence going to all essential elements of the case is not against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence. Id.; C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., 54 Ohio St.2d 279,\n\n376 N.E.2d 578 (1978), syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 228} The juvenile court may grant permanent custody of a child to a children\n\nservices agency if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, two statutory\n\nprongs: (1) the existence of at least one of the four factors set forth in R.C.\n\n2151.414(B)(1)(a) through (d); and (2) the child\u2019s best interest is served by granting\n\npermanent custody to the agency. In re A.H. at \u00b6 12; R.C. 2151.353(A)(4). Clear and\n\nconvincing evidence requires proof which \u201cproduce[s] in the mind of the trier of facts a\n\n\n\n\n61.\n\ffirm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d Cross v. Ledford, 161\n\nOhio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 229} As to the first prong, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) provides that \u201cthe child\n\ncannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be\n\nplaced with either parent.\u201d When making a finding under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), the\n\ncourt must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that only one of the factors\n\nenumerated in R.C. 2151.414(E) exists. In re A.H. at \u00b6 15. Here, the court found R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and those factors are:\n\n       (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and\n\n       notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency\n\n       to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to\n\n       be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and\n\n       repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be\n\n       placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have\n\n       substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental\n\n       utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and\n\n       rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to\n\n       the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to\n\n       resume and maintain parental duties.\n\n\n\n\n62.\n\f      (2) Chronic * * * chemical dependency of the parent that is so severe that it\n\n      makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\n      child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year after the court\n\n      holds the hearing pursuant to division (A) of this section * * *;\n\n      (3) The parent committed any abuse as described in section 2151.031 of the\n\n      Revised Code against the child, caused the child to suffer any neglect as\n\n      described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code, or allowed the child to\n\n      suffer any neglect as described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code\n\n      between the date that the original complaint alleging abuse or neglect was\n\n      filed and the date of the filing of the motion for permanent custody;\n\n      (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by\n\n      failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able\n\n      to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an\n\n      adequate permanent home for the child;\n\n      ***\n\n      (11) The parent has had parental rights involuntarily terminated with\n\n      respect to a sibling of the child pursuant to this section * * * or under an\n\n      existing or former law of * * * any other state * * * that is substantially\n\n      equivalent to those sections, and the parent has failed to provide clear and\n\n      convincing evidence to prove that, notwithstanding the prior termination,\n\n\n\n\n63.\n\f       the parent can provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate\n\n       care for the health, welfare, and safety of the child.\n\n       {\u00b6 230} As to the second prong, the best interest of the child, when making this\n\ndetermination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) provides that the court \u201cshall consider all relevant\n\nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s\n\n       parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and\n\n       any other person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n       the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n       or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n       consecutive twenty-two-month period * * *;\n\n       (d) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent\n\n       custody to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n       apply in relation to the parents and child.\n\n       {\u00b6 231} Here, the court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(11) applied.\n\n\n\n\n64.\n\f                               Juvenile Court\u2019s Judgment\n\n       {\u00b6 232} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court issued its judgment entry, in which it\n\ngranted permanent custody of the children to the agency. The court\u2019s overall findings\n\nand conclusions are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 233} The court detailed the history of the cases, including: father\u2019s alleged\n\noverdose in the presence of mother\u2019s three oldest children, followed by two more alleged\n\noverdoses; B.M.\u2019s premature birth, mother\u2019s positive drug test and her denial of drug use;\n\nthe initial concerns with mother, including illegal drug use, lack of stable housing, mental\n\nhealth issues, an unhealthy and detrimental relationship with father, which issues were\n\nnot satisfactorily resolved, despite numerous services offered to her; father\u2019s failure to\n\nmake substantial progress on any of his case plan goals and his continued use of illegal\n\ndrugs; the parents\u2019 drug use; the parents\u2019 lack of credibility with the agency and the court,\n\nabout their relationship, drug use, housing and more, all to the detriment of the safety and\n\nwell-being of the children, who were young and unable to protect themselves.\n\n       {\u00b6 234} The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the GAL, who\n\nwas appointed at the inception of the cases, testified that the children were of young age\n\nand were bonded with their parents and their foster family, and it was in the best interests\n\nof the children that the motion for permanent custody be granted and mother and father\u2019s\n\nparental rights be terminated. The court found the GAL did not comply, in total, with\n\nSup.R. 48, as reports were not timely filed and certain responsibilities were not fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\n65.\n\fThe court found that while no party objected to or complained about the GAL, it was the\n\ncourt\u2019s responsibility to oversee the GAL. The court found that from the time the\n\ncomplaints were filed through trial, it had regular and frequent contact with mother and\n\nfather, at the hearings where testimony related to the parents and the children, was\n\nreceived, and due to mother\u2019s involvement with FIC. The court found that due to its\n\nfrequent contacts with the parents, significant weight was not given to the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations, thus any deficiencies in the GAL\u2019s performance were harmless. The\n\ncourt found the evidence on which it relied was significant enough to stand alone.\n\nFirst Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 235} The court found, in accordance with R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), the children\n\ncannot or should not be placed with the parents. The court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(1),\n\n(2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n\n(1) the children were placed outside of the home, and notwithstanding reasonable case\n\nplanning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy their problems\n\nwhich caused the children\u2019s removal from the home, each parent failed continuously and\n\nrepeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions which caused the children to be placed\n\noutside of the home; (2) father\u2019s chemical dependency was so severe that he was unable\n\nto provide an adequate permanent home for the children at the present time, and it was\n\nnot anticipated that he could remedy that within one year after the court\u2019s hearing; (3) the\n\nparents allowed the children to suffer abuse and neglect, from the date that the complaints\n\n\n\n\n66.\n\fwere filed through trial; and (4) each parent demonstrated a lack of commitment to the\n\nchildren by showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\nchildren. The court also found father\u2019s parental rights were involuntarily terminated to\n\ntwo half-siblings of the children, and he failed to provide clear and convincing evidence\n\nto prove that, notwithstanding the prior terminations, he could provide a legally secure\n\npermanent placement and adequate care for the health, welfare and safety of the children.\n\nSecond Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 236} The court made the following findings, in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), that: permanent custody was in the best interest of the children, and in\n\ndetermining the best interest of each child, the court considered all credible evidence\n\nrelated to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship of the children with the parents,\n\nsiblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who\n\nmay significantly affect the children; (2) the custodial history of the children, including\n\nwhether the children were in the agency\u2019s temporary custody for 12 or more months in a\n\nconsecutive 22-month period; (3) the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement, and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency; and (4) whether any of the factors in R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) applied; the court found (E)(11) applied, as father had his parental\n\nrights involuntarily terminated to two half-siblings of the children.\n\n\n\n\n67.\n\f       {\u00b6 237} The court further found that the children were placed with a foster family\n\nsince their removal in December 2021, and the foster family wished to adopt the children.\n\nThe evidence showed that the children were doing well in their foster home, and were\n\nstable, safe and meeting their developmental milestones. The children were bonded with\n\nthe parents and foster family, and the children had regular visits with the parents and\n\nX.H. The foster mom testified she and her husband intended to have the children\n\ncontinue their relationship with X.H., and maintain regular contact.\n\n       {\u00b6 238} The court found, in considering all of the best interests factors, there was\n\nclear and convincing evidence presented that the children cannot and should not be\n\nplaced with either parent, and it was in the best interest of each child that permanent\n\ncustody be granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 239} The court ordered mother and father\u2019s parental rights, privileges and\n\nresponsibilities to the children were terminated. The court further ordered that permanent\n\ncustody of the children was granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 240} Mother and father appealed.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s First Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 241} Mother argues the juvenile court abused its discretion when it denied the\n\njoint motion to dismiss. She sets forth two issues:\n\n\n\n\n68.\n\f         Issue One: The trial court erred when it decided that mother failed to\n\n         substantially mitigate or rectify the circumstances which caused the\n\n         children\u2019s removal.\n\n         Issue Two: The motion for permanent custody was filed outside the two-\n\n         year time limit of R.C. 2151.353(G).\n\n                                  Father\u2019s Assignment of Error\n\n         {\u00b6 242} Father argues the juvenile court erred when it granted the motion for\n\npermanent custody because the original complaint had been filed more than two years\n\nprior.\n\n                                         R.C. 2151.353\n\n         {\u00b6 243} R.C. 2151.353(G) states:\n\n         Any temporary custody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier\n\n         of the date on which the complaint in the case was filed or the child was\n\n         first placed into shelter care, except that, upon the filing of a motion\n\n         pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the temporary custody\n\n         order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a dispositional\n\n         order under that section. In resolving the motion, the court shall not order\n\n         an existing temporary custody order to continue beyond two years after the\n\n         date on which the complaint was filed or the child was first placed into\n\n         shelter care, whichever date is earlier * * *.\n\n\n\n\n69.\n\f              Judgment Entry - Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 244} The juvenile court denied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss the motion\n\npermanent custody filed by the agency. The court\u2019s findings are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 245} The court found that mother and father have a significant drug history, as\n\nevidenced throughout the pendency of the cases where they struggled with substance\n\nabuse and had positive drug screens. The court found \u201c[t]he parties have been less than\n\nhonest with the Court and with the Agency,\u201d and their \u201ccredibility was compromised\n\nthrough statements that they made in their testimony concerning their use of illegal\n\nsubstances, their relationship with each other and whether they resided together, and for\n\nextensive periods of time one or both evaded the Agency.\u201d The court stressed \u201c[t]he\n\ncompromise of their credibility is taken as a significant factor in this Decision.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 246} The court cited R.C. 2151.353(G), and observed the parents argued the\n\nagency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed outside of the time frame prescribed by\n\nstatute, and should be dismissed and the children returned to the parents. The court\n\ndeclined to address the issue, as it was not \u201ccentral to this Motion due to Ohio case law.\u201d\n\nThe court referred to In re Young Children, 76 Ohio St.3d 632, 638, 669 N.E.2d 1140\n\n(1996), and noted parents\u2019 counsel \u201call agree[d] and acknowledge[d]\u201d the case which\n\nheld that \u201calthough the Agency filed its Motion for Permanent Custody outside the\n\nstatutory guidelines, the Court can make dispositional orders relating to the children if the\n\n\n\n\n70.\n\foriginal problems that were present at the time of the filing of the complaints have not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 247} The court found \u201c[d]uring the pendency of this case, both [parents] were\n\nheld in contempt for failing to comply with the Court\u2019s Order adopting the case plan. The\n\nbasis of both parents\u2019 contempt was that they failed to follow the treatment\n\nrecommendations of their individual providers.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 248} The court concluded the original facts which led to the filing of the\n\ncomplaints were not mitigated, because mother continued her relationship with father and\n\nlived with him. As such, the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions\n\nimpacted on each other. The court found it retained jurisdiction, and denied the parents\u2019\n\nmotion.\n\n                            Mother and Father\u2019s Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 249} We will first address portions of Issue One and all of Issue Two, along\n\nwith father\u2019s assignment of error, as similar arguments are presented.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Relevant Arguments and Issue Two\n\n       {\u00b6 250} Mother offers a timeline of the children\u2019s cases: July 13, 2020, complaints\n\nfiled; December 30, 2021, the children removed; January 31, 2022, mother consented to\n\nagency\u2019s temporary custody; December 30, 2022, agency filed motion to return the\n\nchildren to mother, within R.C. 2151.414(A) time period; and January 31, 2023, agency\n\nfiled for permanent custody, outside of R.C. 2151.414(A) time period.\n\n\n\n\n71.\n\f        {\u00b6 251} Mother argues the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed\n\noutside of the two-year time limit in R.C. 2151.353(G). She contends temporary custody\n\nwas granted on January 31, 2022, but the agency filed no motions until December 30,\n\n2022, when the agency filed to return the children or extend temporary custody. Mother\n\nasserts this is outside of the two-year deadline from the date the complaints were filed in\n\nJuly 2020, thus the juvenile court erred when it denied mother\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n        {\u00b6 252} Mother submits that no matter when the clock started ticking, with the\n\nfiling of the complaints or when the agency was granted temporary custody, the agency\n\ndid not file for permanent custody within the one year \u201csunset date,\u201d in R.C.\n\n2151.353(G). She also claims the agency did not file its motion for permanent custody\n\none month prior to the termination of the temporary custody order, pursuant to R.C.\n\n2141.415(A).\n\n        {\u00b6 253} Father argues the two-year deadline in R.C. 2151.415(D)(4) is steadfast\n\nand has been applied by courts as a definite deadline. He cites to In re L.B., 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 112407, 2023-Ohio-2392. Father contends he filed a motion to dismiss\n\nthe cases because the complaints were filed more than two years prior, on July 13, 2020,\n\nand the motion for permanent custody was filed January 30, 2023. He claims \u201c[i]t is\n\ncommon knowledge that two years equals 730 days, and here, 931 days had passed.\n\nFather submits the agency allowed more 200 days to elapse before filing, which is too\n\nlate.\n\n\n\n\n72.\n\f                                    Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 254} An abuse of discretion indicates the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable,\n\narbitrary or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d\n\n1140 (1983).\n\n                                       Law and Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 255} The parents argue the juvenile court erred when it did not grant the joint\n\nmotion to dismiss, based on the untimely motion for permanent custody filed by the\n\nagency.\n\n       {\u00b6 256} In reaching its judgment entry denying the joint motion to dismiss, the\n\njuvenile court relied on In re Young, 76 Ohio St.3d 632, 669 N.E.2d 1140. In that case,\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio held \u201cthe passing of the sunset date pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.353(F)5 does not divest juvenile courts of jurisdiction to enter dispositional orders.\u201d\n\nId. at 637. The court further found:\n\n               The obligation to file a motion [for permanent custody] thirty days\n\n       prior to the sunset date is not vitiated and the failure to file is not harmless\n\n       error. * * * Accordingly, although the court has continuing jurisdiction,\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The version of R.C. 2151.353(F) in effect at that time, provided: Any temporary\ncustody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier of the date on which the\ncomplaint in the case was filed or the child was first placed into shelter care, except that,\nupon the filing of a motion pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the\ntemporary custody order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a\ndispositional order under that section.\n\n\n\n73.\n\f       temporary custody terminates when the sunset date passes without a filing\n\n       pursuant to R.C. 2151.415(A). However, because the court retains\n\n       jurisdiction over the child, it may make further dispositional orders as it\n\n       deems necessary to protect the child. * * *\n\n              This holding allows the juvenile court to assess each situation on its\n\n       merits and does not mandate the return of children to a situation from\n\n       which they originally needed protection solely because the agency charged\n\n       with their care missed a filing deadline. Thus, we hold that when the sunset\n\n       date has passed without a filing pursuant to R.C. 2151.415 and the\n\n       problems that led to the original grant of temporary custody have not been\n\n       resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts have the discretion to make a\n\n       dispositional order in the best interests of the child. Where the original\n\n       problems have been resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts may not make\n\n       further dispositional orders based on the original complaint. Id. at 638.\n\n       {\u00b6 257} We find, in accordance with the In re Young decision, the juvenile court\n\nhad the authority to exercise its discretion, after the sunset date, to make a dispositional\n\norder in the best interests of the children upon finding that the parents had not remedied\n\nthe problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody.\n\n\n\n\n74.\n\f       {\u00b6 258} We now turn to the remaining arguments in mother\u2019s Issue One, that the\n\njuvenile court erred when it found she had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated her\n\noriginal problems.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Remaining Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 259} Mother argues the evidence shows that she sufficiently mitigated her\n\nproblems, as the agency was ready to return the children to her in December 2021, prior\n\nto the grant of temporary custody. However, because she tested positive for meth on\n\nDecember 8 and 10, 2021, an emergency custody hearing was held on December 30,\n\n2021, \u201c[y]et [the agency] still considered her \u2018compliant\u2019 with all [of] the rest of the case\n\nplan, and noted that the previous eight random drug screens were negative.\u201d (Emphasis\n\nsic.) Shortly thereafter, the court granted temporary custody of the children to the\n\nagency.\n\n       {\u00b6 260} Mother asserts \u201c[t]he parties kept arguing that the \u2018sufficiently mitigated\u2019\n\ntest was to look at the conditions alleged in the original complaint[s],\u201d which \u201callowed\n\nthe court to examine whether [father] had sufficiently mitigated because allegations were\n\nmade regarding his drug use in [the] complaint[s].\u201d But mother claims \u201cas happened in *\n\n* * In re Young * * * a new complaint for temporary custody was filed in December\n\n2021, which as in In re Young, \u2018established its own sunset date because it was based on\n\nfacts learned subsequent to the filing of the original complaint.\u2019 Id. at 638-639.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n75.\n\f       {\u00b6 261} Mother contends the juvenile court \u201cmust have examined the conditions\n\nwhich led to [the agency\u2019s] filing for temporary custody,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen temporary\n\ncustody was granted, [father] was no longer on a case plan * * * [so] his conditions\n\nshould not have been examined under the [sufficiently mitigated] Young test.\u201d She insists\n\nthe juvenile court should have only considered her two positive meth screens, her\n\nsubsequent eight negative screens and her successful completion of inpatient treatment\n\nfor the second time. She claims, taking the case history as a whole, she showed she \u201cwas\n\nsuccessfully in recovery and was committed to being sober and continuing supportive\n\ntreatment.\u201d\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 262} Upon review, we find that, pursuant to In re Young, the juvenile court\n\nproperly exercised its discretion by making a dispositional order in the children\u2019s best\n\ninterests, when the evidence in the record clearly supported its ruling that mother and\n\nfather\u2019s original problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody, had not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated after the sunset date had passed.\n\n       {\u00b6 263} Mother\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included: struggling with illegal drug use, she tested positive for\n\nmeth twice the month prior; continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user;\n\nand not being truthful or cooperative, as she repeatedly denied using drugs and denied\n\n\n\n\n76.\n\fbeing in a relationship with father. At the time the sunset date passed, mother had not\n\nresolved or sufficiently mitigated her problem with drugs, lying and father.\n\n         {\u00b6 264} Father\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included repeated use of illegal drugs, positive drug screens and not\n\nbeing truthful or cooperative with the agency or court. At the time that the sunset date\n\npassed, father had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated his problem with drugs and\n\nlying.\n\n         {\u00b6 265} We find no abuse of discretion by the juvenile court. Accordingly, we\n\nfind mother\u2019s first assignment of error not well-taken and father\u2019s sole assignment not\n\nwell-taken.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\nMother\u2019s Arguments\n\n         {\u00b6 266} Mother argues the juvenile court erred by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. She notes the court, in its final judgment entry, stated\n\nit did not place significant weight on the GAL\u2019s report, and that any deficiencies in the\n\nGAL\u2019s performance were harmless. Mother asserts the GAL\u2019s report concerned X.H.,\n\nnot the children, thus she \u201cwas severely prejudiced by being unaware of the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations and reasons for [the children] before the hearing.\u201d She further argues\n\nthe GAL\u2019s testimony in lieu of a report was minimal and, as the trial court found, done in\n\nnear-complete failure to observe the requirements of the GAL report and [Sup.R.] 48.\n\n\n\n\n77.\n\f       {\u00b6 267} Mother contends \u201c[t]he GAL\u2019s complete failure to file a report on [the]\n\nchildren, or adequately investigate the children and [mother], should have warranted\n\ndismissal of the matter as to [the children]. She claims \u201c[i]f the errors were fatal to the\n\ncase as to X.H., then the errors should be found even more fatal here.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 268} Mother submits that \u201c[p]ermitting or not striking the GAL\u2019s testimony\n\nregarding [the] two children constitutes plain error.\u201d She maintains \u201cthe GAL\u2019s oral\n\nreport, which he stated was in lieu of a written report, was deficient and non-compliant\n\nwith Sup.R. 48 and the Williams County local rules. This is not harmless error as the\n\ntrial court found.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 269} In support, she cites to In re A.S., 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 21AP-249,\n\n21AP-259, 2022-Ohio-1861, where the parent, at the permanent custody trial, failed to\n\nobject to the admission of the GAL\u2019s testimony and report, thus the plain error standard\n\nof review applied when considering whether the juvenile court erred by failing to remove\n\nthe GAL and by admitting the GAL\u2019s testimony. Id. at \u00b6 54. Mother requests the\n\njuvenile court\u2019s judgment be reversed, based on plain error.\n\nState\u2019s Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 270} The state argues the children\u2019s cases are similar to In re T.C., 6th Dist.\n\nLucas No. L-15-1106, 2015-Ohio-3665, \u00b6 21-22, which was recently cited in Short v.\n\nRhodes, 2021-Ohio-1845, 173 N.E.3d 806 (6th Dist.) and In re A.D., 2023-Ohio-2442,\n\n221 N.E.3d 259 (3d Dist.).\n\n\n\n\n78.\n\f                                             Law\n\nPlain Error\n\n       {\u00b6 271} \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the\n\nextremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no\n\nobjection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the\n\nunderlying judicial process itself.\u201d Goldfuss v. Davidson, 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d\n\n1099 (1997), syllabus. Further, \u201c[i]n applying the doctrine of plain error in a civil case,\n\nreviewing courts must proceed with the utmost caution, limiting the doctrine strictly to\n\nthose extremely rare cases where exceptional circumstances require its application to\n\nprevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 121.

This court noted \u201c[t]he purpose of appointing a [GAL] in a\n\nparental rights allocation proceeding is \u2018to provide the court with relevant information\n\nand an informed recommendation regarding the child\u2019s best interest.\u2019 Sup.R. 48(D).\n\nRules of superintendence are not, however, \u2018the equivalent of rules of procedure and have\n\nno force equivalent to a statute.\u2019 * * * They are \u2018internal housekeeping rules which are of\n\nconcern to the judges of the several courts but create no rights in individual[s].\u2019\u201d\n\n(Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 21.\n\n       {\u00b6 275} \u201cThis court has interpreted Sup.R. 48(D) as a general guideline for the\n\nconduct of courts. See In re E.S., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT-14-008, 2014-Ohio-3067, \u00b6\n\n64 (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the [GAL]\u2019s\n\ntestimony and report even though appellant complained that the guardian failed to\n\ncomply with Sup.R. 48(D)).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. \u201cFurther, the trial court, as trier of fact, is\n\n\n\n\n80.\n\fpermitted to assign weight to the [GAL]\u2019s testimony and recommendation and to consider\n\nit in the context of all the evidence before the court.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 276} A review of the record shows the juvenile court understood the GAL\u2019s\n\nshort-comings, observed the GAL did not comply with all of the requirements of Sup.R.\n\n48, with respect to the timely filing of reports and performing certain duties, and\n\nappreciated it was the court\u2019s responsibility to oversee the GAL.\n\n       {\u00b6 277} The court described its active involvement in the cases from the time the\n\ncomplaints were filed until trial, noting it had regular and frequent contact with the\n\nparents at the multiple hearings, where testimony related to the parents and the children\n\nwas received. The court had additional contact with mother when she was a participant\n\nin FIC. The court recognized that due to its repeated contacts with the parents, it did not\n\ngive significant weight to the GAL\u2019s recommendations, as the evidence on which it relied\n\nwas significant enough to stand alone.\n\n       {\u00b6 278} The record further reveals that during the time that the children\u2019s cases\n\nwere pending, GAL Cook filed seven reports and after the first day of trial, he filed\n\nClosing Argument/Proposed Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law. The record also\n\nshows that throughout the cases, five agency employees worked on the cases at various\n\ntimes. The employees reported their dealings with the children and parents to the court,\n\nand some of the employees also shared their opinions and beliefs concerning the\n\n\n\n\n81.\n\fchildren\u2019s best interest. In addition, the children\u2019s foster mom provided the court with\n\ninformation concerning the children, their well-being and their visits with the parents, and\n\nshe shared what she thought was in the children\u2019s best interests.\n\n       {\u00b6 279} Given the applicable law, and the state of the record including the ample\n\nevidence regarding the children\u2019s best interests, exclusive of the GAL\u2019s trial testimony,\n\nwe find the juvenile court did not commit plain error by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. Moreover, we find the dismissal of X.H.\u2019s case does\n\nnot in any way affect the children\u2019s cases or warrant the dismissal of the children\u2019s cases,\n\nas X.H.\u2019s case was dismissed because the juvenile found that X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity\n\nto be included in the case plan for X.H. was insufficient.\n\n       {\u00b6 280} Accordingly, mother\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                               Third Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 281} Mother argues \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and\n\nfinding that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.\u201d She contends she substantially remedied the conditions which\n\ncaused the children to be placed outside of the home, but emergency custody was granted\n\nbased on her two out of ten positive drug screens in one month. She claims she \u201chad\n\nbeen sober for almost one year and had completed the case plan at the time of trial,\u201d and\n\nbut for being with father, the children would have been returned to her.\n\n\n\n\n82.\n\f       {\u00b6 282} Mother asserts \u201cshe did not allow the children to suffer abuse and neglect\n\nsince the filing of the complaint and motion for permanent custody, as \u201cthe caseworkers\n\ntestified that [mother] was bonded to the children and visitations were going very well.\u201d\n\nYet, \u201cthe trial court found that her \u2018continued use of illegal drugs\u2019 and the two inpatient\n\ntreatment stints constituted neglect.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) This is irrational and unreasonable,\n\nshe argues, since the court ordered her to \u201cperform both inpatient treatments; to have the\n\ntrial court\u2019s orders warrant a finding of neglect is an abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 283} Mother maintains that she showed commitment and a willingness to\n\nprovide a permanent home, and at the time of trial, \u201cshe had obtained new housing and\n\nsubmitted evidence that the home was appropriate and safe.\u201d She claims she was no\n\nlonger with father \u201cand the court should have found that she was no longer living with\n\nhim * * * [and her] parental rights should not hinge upon whether [he] could follow a\n\ncase plan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 284} Mother argues as to \u201cthe children\u2019s best interests: the GAL\u2019s deficiencies\n\nand total lack of a report render the GAL\u2019s opinion on this point useless; however, the\n\nGAL did testify that \u2018absolutely\u2019 there was a detriment to the children in severing their\n\nbond with [mother].\u201d Mother \u201crequests this Court review the statutory best interest\n\nfactors and find that permanent custody is not in the children\u2019s interest, as their mother\n\nhad made a permanent and appropriate home and had rectified the conditions that led to\n\nremoval.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n83.\n\f                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 285} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court filed a 17-page judgment entry in\n\nwhich it granted permanent custody of the children to the agency, and terminated mother\n\nand father\u2019s parental rights to the children. In so ruling, the court summarized the\n\nextensive evidence presented, cited to and relied upon the applicable law, indicated which\n\nfactors it considered and offered well-reasoned explanations for the decision it rendered.\n\nFirst Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 286} We have carefully reviewed the record, which we conclude contains clear\n\nand convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that the children cannot\n\nand should not be placed with either mother or father, as both parents repeatedly and\n\ncontinuously failed to remedy the conditions which caused the children\u2019s removal from\n\nthe home, despite reasonable case planning, a multitude of case plan services and diligent\n\nefforts by the agency offered to assist the parents to remedy their problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 287} Throughout the agency\u2019s involvement with the family, the main concerns\n\nwere the parents\u2019 drug use, relationship and housing. Both parents used illegal drugs,\n\nwhich was confirmed by countless positive drug screens, yet both denied drug use for the\n\nmajority of the cases. The court ordered mother and father to partake in drug treatment\n\nprograms, yet drug use continued; father used regularly, mother used more sporadically.\n\nThe parents\u2019 relationship was concerning, largely due to their drug use. By the parents\u2019\n\naccounts, their relationship was on and off, however, since the parents were often not\n\n\n\n\n84.\n\fhonest with the court or the agency, which was revealed in their jail communications and\n\ninconsistent statements and testimony, the status of their relationship was not always\n\nknown. Housing was a concern as it was rarely stable and appropriate, because mother\n\nand the children frequently moved between the trailer and T.V.\u2019s home and father moved,\n\nsometimes with the children, from trailers, to relatives, to Kentucky and to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\nIt was never really known when the parents lived together, as they were not always\n\nhonest and forthcoming with the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 288} We further conclude that clear and convincing evidence in the record\n\nsupports the juvenile court\u2019s findings that both parents exhibited a lack of commitment to\n\nthe children due to their unwillingness to provide an adequate, permanent home for the\n\nchildren, due to father repeatedly failing and/or refusing to engage in substance abuse\n\ntreatment and other case plan requirements, and due to mother repeatedly choosing her\n\nrelationship with father over the needs and safety of the children. Mother was constantly\n\nadvised that the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions impacted on each\n\nother, and that reunification could only occur if she ended her relationship with father.\n\nTime and again mother said she understood, but chose father and prioritized him over the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b6 289} Although mother successfully completed many of her case plan services,\n\nshe failed to change her behaviors; she still used illegal drugs on occasion and continued\n\nher relationship with father. She also defied court orders, was found in contempt of court\n\n\n\n\n85.\n\fand was jailed. Same with father. Thus, the original conditions which led to the filing of\n\nthe complaints, continued to the detriment of the children.\n\nSecond Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 290} We have thoroughly reviewed the record, and we conclude it contains\n\nclear and convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that it was in the\n\nchildren\u2019s best interests for permanent custody to be awarded to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 291} The record shows the juvenile court considered the interaction and\n\nrelationships of the children with mother, father, caregivers and relatives, the children\u2019s\n\ncustodial history and the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement.\n\n       {\u00b6 292} The record further reveals that since the children were removed from the\n\nhome in December 2021, they have been with the same foster family and were stable,\n\nsafe and doing well. The children, who were bonded with the parents and foster family,\n\nhad regular visits with the parents and X.H., which were supervised by the foster mom.\n\nThe foster parents wished to adopt the children, and intended to continue the children\u2019s\n\nrelationship with X.H.\n\n       {\u00b6 293} Based on the foregoing and the abundance of evidence in the record,\n\nincluding the agency\u2019s numerous reports and the GAL reports, we find mother\u2019s third\n\nassignment of error not-well taken.\n\n\n\n\n86.\n\f       {\u00b6 294} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Williams County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed. Appellants, A.H. and K.M. are ordered to\n\nsplit the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\n                                                                       Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.\nSee also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.\n\n\nMyron C.

(\u201cthe children\u201d), and granting permanent custody of the children to appellee,\n\nWilliams County Job and Family Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d). For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe affirm the judgment.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} Mother sets forth three assignments of error:\n\n             1. The trial court abused its discretion in denying A.H. and K.M.\u2019s\n\n      joint motion to dismiss based on the passage of time.\n\n             2. The trial court committed plain error by not dismissing the case as\n\n      to [the children] for the GAL\u2019s [(Guardian Ad Litem)] failure to perform\n\n      his duties, to the prejudice of A.H.\n\n             3. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and finding\n\n      that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\n      convincing evidence.\n\n      {\u00b6 3} Father sets forth one assignment of error:\n\n             1. The trial court errored [sic] when it granted the motion for\n\n      permanent custody [sic] because the original complaint had been filed more\n\n      than two years prior.\n\n                                      Background\n\n      {\u00b6 4} Mother has four biological children: S.O., born in or about 2008; X.H., born\n\nin 2010; M.M., born in November 2018; and B.M., born in April 2020. S.O. and X.H.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fwere fathered by men other than K.M., and are not involved in this appeal. However,\n\nS.O. and X.H. will be mentioned when pertinent and significant to this appeal.\n\n         {\u00b6 5} The agency\u2019s involvement with mother, father and the children spanned\n\nthree years, 2020 through 2023, during which time four cases were filed and numerous\n\ncourt hearings were held. What occurred at these hearings is helpful to understanding the\n\nprogression of the cases, thus, the relevant events are summarized below.\n\n2020\n\n         {\u00b6 6} On April 29, 2020, the agency became involved with the family when\n\nmother tested positive for oxycodone (\u201coxy\u201d), methamphetamine (\u201cmeth\u201d) and\n\namphetamine (\u201camphet\u201d)1 at the time of B.M.\u2019s premature birth. Mother denied drug\n\nuse. In May 2020, mother tested positive for meth, and again denied drug use. Safety\n\nplans were established by the agency for the benefit of all four of mother\u2019s children.\n\n         {\u00b6 7} On July 13, 2020, complaints were filed which alleged the children were\n\ndependent and neglected; father\u2019s overdose in December 2019 was mentioned.\n\n         {\u00b6 8} The agency established case plans for mother and father, which were\n\nagreeable to the parents. Mother\u2019s case plan required her to: maintain housing and\n\nemployment; complete PRC2 applications, parenting classes and the Family Intervention\n\n\n\n1\n    Meth is converted by the body into amphet.\n2\n PRC paid for visitations, parenting classes and other services. Without a completed\napplication, the parent had to self-pay for the services.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fCourt program (\u201cFIC\u201d); comply with home visits and drug screens; and undergo\n\nsubstance use and mental health treatment. Father\u2019s case plan was the same, but FIC was\n\nnot included.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On August 12, 2020, GAL Aaron Cook filed a report concerning the family\n\nmembers. Also on the day, the children were adjudicated neglected and dependent, and\n\nthe agency was granted protective supervision of the children.\n\n2021\n\n                    Semi-Annual Review Hearing - January 5, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Mother attended the hearing and consented to the agency\u2019s continued\n\nprotective supervision of the children. Father did not attend the hearing.\n\n                  Annual Review Hearing/GAL Report - July 1, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 11} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother attended the hearing via Zoom, father did not attend. In April\n\n2021, mother had a random drug screen and was positive for meth, she failed to show for\n\nan appointment at Recovery Services (\u201cRecovery\u201d), and cancelled an appointment.\n\nMother then started inpatient treatment at Serenity Haven (\u201cSerenity\u201d); she was sober and\n\ntaking parenting classes. Her 68-year-old grandfather, T.V. (the children\u2019s great-\n\ngrandfather), took in all four of mother\u2019s children while she was in inpatient treatment.\n\nMother had two visits with the children, but visits stopped due to a verbal altercation and\n\nbecause the children had severe head lice.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\f       {\u00b6 13} In May and June 2021, father had three random drug screens and tested\n\npositive for, respectively: THC; cocaine, meth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet and\n\nTHC. The court suspended father\u2019s visits with the children due to his failure to comply\n\nwith the case plan. Protective supervision of the children was continued.\n\n                                   Show Cause - Father\n\n       {\u00b6 14} On August 12, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging father\n\nfailed to follow the court\u2019s orders; a hearing on the motion was scheduled for September\n\n8, 2021. However, father emailed the caseworker that he could not attend the hearing\n\nbecause his 20-year-old daughter died and the funeral was in Kentucky on September 8,\n\n2021. The court rescheduled the hearing, and ordered father to provide written\n\nverification of his daughter\u2019s death and funeral.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The show cause hearing was for rescheduled September 15, 2021, but\n\nfather failed to appear and there was no communication with him since his email. The\n\ncourt issued a bench warrant for father; he was arrested.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} On September 22, 2021, a bond hearing was held, with father present, and a\n\n$5,000 bond was requested to ensure father\u2019s appearance at a future hearing. Father told\n\nthe court that he lived in a trailer (\u201cthe trailer\u201d) and \u201ccame back up here to help [mother]\n\nget her place fixed up. We was working things out, I\u2019ve been there all year. That\u2019s my\n\nphysical address.\u201d Father claimed he had no money for bond, as all of his money was\n\nwrapped up in the trailer. The judge ordered $5,000 bond, no 10%.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       {\u00b6 17} On September 28, 2021, the show cause hearing was held, and father\n\nadmitted he violated the court\u2019s orders. The court accepted father\u2019s admissions, released\n\nhim from custody and scheduled a sentencing date.\n\n                          Review Hearing - October 21, 2021\n\n       {\u00b6 18} The 15-month review hearing was held; mother was present, father was\n\nnot, as his attorney indicated that father was working and could not miss work. It was\n\nrequested that protective custody be extended. Mother claimed she was not in\n\nrelationship with father and continued to work her case plan, but she had a positive drug\n\nscreen in September 2021. Father tested positive for THC in early October 2021, and he\n\ntested positive for a relatively high level of meth, amphet and THC in mid-October 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} GAL Cook testified and voiced numerous concerns. First, T.V. spent less\n\ntime with mother\u2019s four children, so mother stepped in to help. The two older children\n\nwere criminally charged for property damage, and school was not great. Next, despite\n\ncourt orders that father have only supervised visits, when he was in jail the video footage\n\nrevealed that he asked mother to allow him to see the children and she complied. The\n\nGAL viewed another video in which mother said to father that the court expected her to\n\nbreak up with him, but she had no intention of doing so; she would just tell the court what\n\nit wanted to hear. The GAL questioned how much progress the parents made in the last\n\n15 months, and thought future options should be explored, as the parents seemed intent\n\non deceiving the court and not working the process.\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\f         {\u00b6 20} The court temporarily extended protective custody; a full hearing was\n\nscheduled to determine whether to continue protective custody beyond the one-year\n\nmark.\n\n     GAL Report/Motion to Extend Protective Custody Hearing - November 12, 2021\n\n         {\u00b6 21} GAL Cook filed a report with updates regarding the family members.\n\n         {\u00b6 22} Mother and father attended the hearing. Mother completed inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, outpatient treatment at Recovery and was in aftercare sessions.\n\nOverall, she made significant progress in her case plan services, yet she was unemployed,\n\nreceived disability payments, had not secured her own housing and had only T.V. for\n\nsupport.\n\n         {\u00b6 23} Father completed an assessment at Recovery and it was initially\n\nrecommended that he attend individual counseling, submit to random drug screens and go\n\nto medication management services. However, due to father\u2019s positive drug screens,\n\nintensive outpatient group sessions were suggested. Father was drug tested by the agency\n\ntwice a month, and all screens were positive for illegal drugs. It was reported that\n\nbetween July and October 2021, father refused some drug screens and threatened agency\n\nworkers, so no meetings were attempted with him due to safety concerns. Father\u2019s\n\nbehavior improved, he was civil and he apologized for his actions.\n\n         {\u00b6 24} In late October 2021, father suffered a serious leg injury. He disclosed that\n\nhe received social security disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) and worked construction on the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fside; he did not verify his work. Father lived at the trailer, owned by the trailer park, and\n\npaid lot rent and utilities. Since April 2021, he made improvements on the trailer. He\n\nslowly worked on his case plan and made some progress.\n\n        {\u00b6 25} The court granted the agency\u2019s motion to extend protective supervision.\n\n        Sanction Hearing for Father\u2019s Contempt Citation - November 23, 2021\n\n        {\u00b6 26} Father provided the court with the obituary for his 22-year-old step-\n\ndaughter, who died in Kentucky on August 20, 2021. Father attended the viewing on or\n\nabout August 24, 2021, but not the funeral, and he returned to Ohio on September 1,\n\n2021.\n\n        {\u00b6 27} The agency indicated that father was cooperative, signed a release of\n\ninformation and allowed four home visits; the trailer was clean and father claimed that\n\nonly he will live there. He attended one individual treatment session at Recovery, on\n\nNovember 1, 2021, did not attend two later sessions and failed to participate in intensive\n\ngroup sessions. He claimed he completed a TeleMed mental health assessment in\n\nNovember 2021. Father\u2019s two drug tests by Recovery were positive for, respectively:\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; and meth, amphet, THC, THC3 and hydromorphone (for which\n\nfather had a prescription), and his two drug screens by the agency, conducted on different\n\ndates than Recovery\u2019s tests, were both positive for meth, amphet and THC. Father was\n\nunable to visit the children due to his leg injury.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f        {\u00b6 28} The agency recommended, as a sanction for the contempt citation, that\n\nfather attend the Renewal Center (\u201cRenewal\u201d) and complete any recommended treatment;\n\nno jail time was recommended if successfully completed Renewal.\n\n        {\u00b6 29} The court sentenced father to 30 days in jail, which were suspended if he\n\nsuccessfully completed Renewal or any other inpatient rehab and complied with all\n\noutpatient orders and recommendations.\n\n                                  Show Cause - Mother\n\n        {\u00b6 30} On December 28, 2021, the agency filed a show cause motion alleging\n\nmother failed to follow the court\u2019s orders. On December 30, 2021, a motion hearing was\n\nheld, with mother present. It was reported that on December 8, 2021, mother was drug\n\nscreened by Recovery and tested positive for Gabapentin, which she was prescribed, but\n\n\u201cit came back at a high level,\u201d and she was also screened by FIC, and tested positive for\n\nmeth. On December 10, 2021, she was drug screened by Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth. Mother was drug tested by the agency in November and December 2021, on\n\ndifferent days than Recovery and FIC, and all tests were negative.\n\n        {\u00b6 31} The positive drug tests were discussed with mother; she did not admit to\n\ndrug use. Recovery recommended intensive outpatient treatment, while FIC\n\nrecommended inpatient treatment at Serenity, where she would be admitted on January 4,\n\n2022.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 32} The court found mother in contempt by violating her case plan when she,\n\ninter alia, tested positive for illegal drugs. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, to be\n\nserved immediately unless she purged the contempt by completing a refresher course at\n\nSerenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The court granted emergency custody of all four of mother\u2019s children to the\n\nagency. The four children were removed from the home and placed in foster homes.\n\n2022\n\n                        Motion for Reconsideration and Hearing\n\n       {\u00b6 34} On January 5, 2022, mother filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ncourt\u2019s findings that she violated the court\u2019s orders by using illegal drugs, not being\n\ntruthful or cooperative, and continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} On January 10, 2022, a hearing was held and mother presented evidence\n\nthat on January 3, 2022, she took a hair follicle test and no drugs were detected. She\n\ntestified, and presented the testimony of the worker who collected her hair sample, sent it\n\nout for testing and received the test results. The agency offered the testimony of a\n\nforensic toxicologist, who studied the effects of drugs on the body and worked in a\n\nlaboratory which specialized in detecting drugs in biological fluids.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The court found the science clearly showed there was meth in mother\u2019s\n\ndrug screen, which was a violation of the court\u2019s order. The court found nothing to\n\noverturn its previous findings, and denied mother\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f      Hearing on Temporary Custody and Motion for Sanctions - January 31, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 37} Mother and father were present at the hearing and both consented to the\n\nagency\u2019s request for temporary custody of the children. Father then asked to be removed\n\nfrom the case plan, which the court permitted; the agency withdrew its motion for\n\nsanctions.\n\n        {\u00b6 38} The court granted temporary custody of the children to the agency.\n\n                             Review Hearing - March 9, 2022\n\n        {\u00b6 39} Mother attended the hearing, father did not. It was reported that father\n\nwanted to be on back on the case plan again; he was added back. Mother was in inpatient\n\ntreatment at Serenity, she was compliant and had an expected out-date of April 5, 2022.\n\nIt was not known where mother would live when released, as the agency conducted a\n\nhome study of T.V., and while he passed his background check and his home was\n\napproved, he had four positive screens for THC so more random drug tests were sought.\n\nMother visited with the children, and there were no concerns. The children did well in\n\ntheir foster home, although M.M. struggled and cried a lot at first due to her attachment\n\nissues with mother.\n\n        {\u00b6 40} The court found it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain in their\n\ncurrent placement, and for the agency to have temporary custody. Father\u2019s 30-day jail\n\nsentence was reimposed, but suspended if he successfully completed inpatient drug\n\ntreatment.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f                   GAL Reports - June 27, 2022, July 1 and 24, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 41} GAL Cook filed reports with updates as to each family member.\n\n                       Semi-Annual Review Hearing - July 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Bother parents attended the hearing. Also before the court was a motion to\n\ndetermine the status of father\u2019s case plan, as he was added back to the plan on March 10,\n\n2022, but then said he did not want to be on the case plan. Father\u2019s counsel indicated\n\nfather wanted to be on the case plan and father was willing to sign the plan that day.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Father completed no case plan goals, and his last drug screen for the\n\nagency on May 4, 2022, was positive for THC and fentanyl. The caseworker attempted\n\nto visit or meet with father 11 times, but father did not answer the door or he was a no-\n\nshow. He visited the children every other week, which went well. Father showed the\n\nchildren a picture of a puppy, and said he and mother bought the puppy.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Mother lived with T.V., whose home was approved for the children.\n\nMother did not work; she received SSDI. She visited the children every other week for\n\ntwo hours, and the visits went very well.\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Mother had a positive drug screen for meth on June 27, 2022, and went\n\nback into Recovery\u2019s IOP (intensive outpatient program), which she attended once a\n\nweek. It was recommended by Recovery that mother go for inpatient treatment; she did\n\nnot comply. Mother was unsuccessfully released from FIC, which was considered a case\n\nplan fail.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 46} The agency was concerned that parents were in a relationship, despite\n\nmother\u2019s claims to the contrary. The parents were seen together many times, including in\n\nApril 2022, when the caseworker saw them together at Wal-Mart, and in June 2022,\n\nwhen the worker saw them in a car together. The worker addressed the June sighting\n\nwith mother, but she claimed they were not together and she had been at home all day.\n\nMother also said father was friends with T.V., and went to T.V.\u2019s home for visits. The\n\nagency made it clear that if the parents were in a relationship, they were judged as a\n\nwhole, so father\u2019s illegal drug use and noncompliance with the case plan reflected on\n\nmother. The agency did not believe mother and father were honest.\n\n       {\u00b6 47} The children were doing very well in their foster placement, their medical\n\nneeds were met, and there were no concerns with them remaining in the foster home.\n\n       {\u00b6 48} Mother testified she went to Wal-Mart with father a couple of weeks after\n\nshe was released from Serenity because she did not have a car; she was released on April\n\n5, 2022. She claimed she did not get a puppy with father; he bought a puppy for the\n\nchildren and the puppy was with mother at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 49} Mother was aware of the recommendation for inpatient treatment at\n\nSerenity, but said she was told if she \u201ccontinued to do what I need to do, sign a behavior\n\ncontract and another piece of paper stating that I will be clean, and do whatever the paper\n\nstates then I should be okay with * * * continuing with IOP.\u201d She did not want to go the\n\nSerenity because \u201cthey\u2019re not very confidential with their information for their clients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\f      {\u00b6 50} Regarding mother\u2019s positive screen for meth on June 27, 2022, she said,\n\n\u201cactually, I wouldn\u2019t have graduated IOP if my cup would have come back positive. My\n\ncup come back negative. * * * [M]y sister and I have been arguing quite often. She went\n\non and told people that she knew that I\u2019m not going to get my kids back, she don\u2019t want\n\nme to have my kids back and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes for me not to get my kids back.\u201d\n\nWhen mother was asked how that translated to a positive screen for meth, she replied,\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on the partying kick and I\u2019m not because I want my kids and I told her that.\n\nI honestly think she did something to my drink.\u201d Mother was questioned about the\n\nspecific circumstances when she was with her sister, and she said,\n\n             It would have been like a Friday or Saturday. Then I found out the\n\n      previous week after me hanging out with her that she was going around\n\n      asking people if she knew me, or if they knew and they were like well I\n\n      know of her, why? And she went about saying well I heard she\u2019s not going\n\n      to get her kids back and she don\u2019t deserve them back, she don\u2019t you know I\n\n      don\u2019t talk to my sister on that kind of level. I don\u2019t want her knowing none\n\n      of my business, I don\u2019t want nobody knowing none of my business unless it\n\n      comes from my mouth.\n\n      {\u00b6 51} When mother was asked if she knew that drugging someone\u2019s drink was a\n\ncrime, she said she knew now, but would not file a police report because \u201cshe\u2019s trying to\n\nget herself out of her situation. I\u2019m not cool with that.\u201d Mother denied using drugs.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\f       {\u00b6 52} Mother was also questioned about her positive drug screen prior to June\n\n2022; she again denied drug use. She could not remember the background of that\n\nprevious screen.\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Father testified, and was asked if he would go to the recommended\n\ninpatient treatment, to which he replied, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do, I mean just everything\u2019s got\n\nmy mind boggled. I mean.\u201d When asked if that was a yes or no, he said, \u201cYes, most\n\ndefinitely, I mean but.\u201d He claimed he was in inpatient treatment for two days, and\n\n\u201cwent from there to the hospital after that because I needed medical attention and well the\n\nRenewed Minds down here in town put me on medication, Suboxone, and that just\n\ndestroyed me.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 54} Father was questioned about overdosing on December 11, 2019, and said,\n\n\u201cI did not overdose.\u201d When asked if he remembered getting Narcan by EMS, he said,\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of why, well okay, now I\u2019m epileptic. I\u2019ve been on medication for that all\n\nmy life, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, stuff like that. And uh, but there were no positive\n\nscreens for anything like that.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 55} Father was asked about testing positive for fentanyl and he said he took the\n\ndrug test the day after he got out of the hospital where he was given painkillers for his\n\nknee, which he claimed almost had to be amputated. He was asked if he was on\n\npainkillers still, and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking no pain killers or nothing like that.\u201d He\n\nwas then asked when he stopped taking prescribed painkillers and he said, \u201cAs soon as I\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\fgot out of the hospital. * * * So it was like November or December. * * * That was like\n\nPercocet that was when I got out of the hospital.\u201d Father admitted marijuana use.\n\n       {\u00b6 56} The court ordered mother and father to submit to a drug test \u201cright now\n\nwhile we\u2019re here,\u201d then report back to court. Mother\u2019s drug screen was negative while\n\nfather was positive for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Father was sentenced to 30 days in jail, and was ordered to report to jail\n\nthat afternoon. The court indicated that prior to the expiration of 30 days, if father was\n\naccepted to inpatient facility, a transfer from jail to the facility would be considered.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but the court allowed her 15 days\n\nto provide verification that she was accepted into inpatient treatment. The court noted, at\n\nthe end of 15 days, if no verification was filed, mother would serve 30 days in jail.\n\n                                Hearing - August 18, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 59} The hearing was held on the court\u2019s own motion; mother was present,\n\nfather was not. Mother did not go for inpatient treatment; she said it was very difficult to\n\nget into treatment because she was not with a provider and she had to care for T.V., who\n\nhad cancer and received chemotherapy. She claimed she had an assessment scheduled\n\nfor August 30, 2022, at A Renewed Mind (\u201cRenewed\u201d), after which she could go for IOP\n\nand counseling. She offered to go to jail on weekends and take care of T.V. during the\n\nweek, at least until she found another caregiver. She did not have verification of T.V.\u2019s\n\ncancer treatments.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f         {\u00b6 60} GAL Cook testified that T.V.\u2019s care was discussed the previous week, so\n\nmother had time to make alternate plans for his care. The GAL also noted mother was\n\nsentenced to 30 days in jail over eight months ago, so she had opportunities to address the\n\nissue.\n\n         {\u00b6 61} The court imposed the 30-day sentence and ordered mother to report to jail\n\nthe next day.\n\n                            Review Hearing - October 25, 2022\n\n         {\u00b6 62} Neither parent was present for the hearing. Mother claimed they were\n\ntravelling to court together when the car broke down, and they were waiting for the police\n\nto help.\n\n         {\u00b6 63} The caseworker reported she conducted a home visit with father outside of\n\nthe trailer, in September 2022, two days after he was released from jail. He began his\n\ncase plan; he attended IOP at Renewed, but missed sessions and he went to two parenting\n\nclasses, then missed one. He tested positive for alcohol and THC, and on October 11,\n\n2022, he was positive for meth. It was unknown if he worked. Father claimed he was\n\nselling the trailer, and listed mother\u2019s address as his address. He had supervised visits\n\nwith the children, which went well.\n\n         {\u00b6 64} After mother was released from jail, she attended IOP at Renewed, four\n\ndays a week. She resided with T.V., and although the caseworker stopped by the home\n\nmany times to see mother and conduct random drug screens, she was never home and\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fthere were no home visits since May 2022. Mother went to the agency to meet and took\n\ndrug tests, which were negative. Mother and father disclosed they were together, lived\n\ntogether at T.V.\u2019s home and had supervised visits with the children together. At that\n\npoint, the agency was not concerned about their relationship.\n\n       {\u00b6 65} The children were doing very well in the foster home where they were\n\nplaced in December 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} GAL Cook testified the case was in the same place that it was at the last\n\nhearing, with miniscule, incremental improvements. Father enrolled in treatment and\n\nparenting classes, but missed classes and had positive drug screens. Father never\n\ncompleted any treatment course and never had a negative drug screen. The GAL\n\nreported that in early 2022, after a court hearing, father had to be revived with Narcan.\n\n       {\u00b6 67} The court ordered that temporary custody of the children remain with the\n\nagency.\n\n            Fifth Semi-Annual Hearing/GAL Report - December 15, 2022\n\n       {\u00b6 68} GAL Cook filed a report with updates with respect to the family members.\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Mother and father were present for the hearing, and also before the court\n\nwas the agency\u2019s motion to extend temporary custody, filed on December 13, 2022. The\n\nagency withdrew its motion, as an extension was barred by statute.\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Caseworker Alaina Russell testified the children were doing very well in\n\ntheir foster home, and visited with the parents bi-weekly for two to three hours. Mother\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\fwas completing treatment at Renewed and doing well, but she missed dates due to T.V.\u2019s\n\nmedical appointments; T.V. had since passed away. She had three random drug tests and\n\none test at the agency; all were negative. Mother\u2019s last positive drug test was in June\n\n2022. She was on disability, did not work and lived with father at T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Father was drug tested at Renewed and was negative for substances in\n\nNovember and December 2022, however during that time, Russell was unable to do\n\nhome visits with father or drug screens; his last screen, taken the end of October 2022,\n\nwas positive for THC. Father had a job and worked third shift. He completed two out of\n\nten parenting classes. Visits went very well, and the children were bonded to their\n\nparents.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} GAL Cook testified that father made considerable progress, at least on\n\npaper, but \u201cit is a touch disappointing that it comes too little too late.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} The court ordered that temporary custody remain with the agency.\n\n\n2023\n\n       {\u00b6 74} On January 31, 2023, the agency filed its motion for permanent custody of\n\nthe children. On February 2, 2023, the parents filed a joint motion to return the children\n\nto their care, as they alleged the agency did not timely file the permanent custody motion.\n\n                                 Hearing - March 23, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 75} The court noted two motions were pending: a motion for permanent\n\ncustody, filed by the agency on January 31, 2023; and the joint motion to dismiss. The\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\fcourt scheduled a trial on the motion for permanent custody and held a hearing on the\n\nmotion to dismiss. Both parents were present, and called Melinda Reynolds, the\n\nsupervisor of the agency\u2019s ongoing unit, as a witness.\n\n                              Melinda Reynolds\u2019 Testimony\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Reynolds was assigned as the ongoing caseworker for the family in\n\nFebruary 2023, and was familiar with the history of the case. She attempted home visits\n\nwith father in February 2023, but was unable to make contact. His last drug screen for\n\nthe agency, in mid-December 2022, was negative.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} On January 23, 2023, a police report was received which alleged that father\n\nhad overdosed. The agency tried to call father that day and the next to have him report\n\nfor a drug screen; no contact was made and father did not report. Father had claimed that\n\nhe worked so he was unable to go to the agency, so a caseworker offered to meet him at\n\nwork, or after, to drug screen him, but father did not cooperate. Father denied drug use.\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father attended services at Renewed, he tested negative for drugs and was\n\nlast seen on February 15, 2023. From October 2022 through January 2023, father missed\n\n17 IOP appointments at Renewed. Mother graduated from relapse prevention and\n\ncontinued \u201cto do individuals.\u201d Reynolds was unaware of any positive drug screens for\n\nmother since October 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father and mother told Reynolds they lived in T.V.\u2019s home and father\n\nworked.\n\n\n\n\n20.\n\f        {\u00b6 80} Reynolds stated substance abuse was a problem which was not resolved or\n\nsufficiently mitigated due to father\u2019s missed drug treatment appointments and his alleged\n\noverdose, where mother called 911 and stated father was turning blue in the face and she\n\nwas performing CPR on him. The police report indicated there was a strong and\n\noverwhelming odor of alcohol on father and there was a white substance in his nostrils.\n\n        {\u00b6 81} It was Reynolds\u2019 original belief that father was drug tested regularly\n\nthrough the IOP, but she learned he had not been tested in about five weeks.\n\n                                     Father\u2019s Testimony\n\n        {\u00b6 82} Father moved in with mother in August 2022, and was in drug treatment at\n\nOhio Guidestone (\u201cGuidestone\u201d)3 for three or four months; he said \u201c[i]t\u2019s been a while. *\n\n* * Well, since August [2022].\u201d He claimed his participation had been regular, but he\n\nstarted a job, had job training and had transportation issues, so it was difficult to attend,\n\nalthough he took drug screens. Since February 15, 2023, he said he was at Guidestone\n\nconsistently twice a week and was drug tested; he did not recall when his last positive\n\ndrug screen was, as \u201cit\u2019s been too long to even recall. * * * I mean it\u2019s been past August I\n\nmean.\u201d He had worked for three months, 40 hours a week.\n\n        {\u00b6 83} Father claimed the alleged overdose on January 23, 2023, was caused by\n\nblood clotting due to his leg injury, which made him get real hot and faint, and almost\n\ncaused a heart attack. He admitted he drank that day, but denied drug use. He said he\n\n\n\n3\n    Guidestone was formerly called A Renewed Mind.\n\n\n\n21.\n\fwent to Renewed on January 24, 25, 26 and 27, 2023, and took drug screens which were\n\nall negative. He did not have recent contact with Reynolds because she did not try to\n\nreach out to him to have him drug tested or do a home visit. Father said he would move\n\nout of the home, if required, so the children could be returned to mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} Father was asked if he remembered saying, at a Zoom meeting on\n\nJanuary 27, 2023, that a car fell on his chest on January 23, 2023, and took the air out of\n\nhim; he replied, \u201cI was working on my car and I remember coming in and sitting down\n\nand that\u2019s, I just got light headed and got real hot.\u201d Father was aware the police report\n\nstated he had a white substance in his nostrils, but he claimed that was \u201cFoam. Spit.\n\nSnot.\u201d He did not recall that the report said the police believed that father\u2019s two friends,\n\nwho were present, were also under the influence of narcotics.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Father was questioned about lying to the agency about his drug use and his\n\nrelationship with mother, and said, \u201cNo, I have not lied. We got back together in August.\n\n* * * They seen us together. Like I would go pick her up, take her to the store, stuff like\n\nthat, I mean, you know but we got back together in August.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father acknowledged he had to complete parenting classes, and was\n\nworking on it but \u201c[t]he woman, Jana, she is having problems cause see my schedule with\n\nwork and stuff to get me there. I already took five (5) classes of it. Only take ten (10)\n\nclasses.\u201d Father was informed he had only taken two classes, to which he replied, \u201cI got\n\nto wait on Jana to get actually room for me to go back in there to take them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n22.\n\f       {\u00b6 87} When asked what his sobriety date was, father responded it \u201cwould be\n\nAugust. I was in jail for thirty (30) days and after I\u2019ve got out I\u2019ve been, so is that, yea,\n\nsince I\u2019ve been clean? * * * Yea, it was I would say August.\u201d He did not recall testing\n\npositive for marijuana on October 26, 2022.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} GAL Cook asked father when IOP with Guidestone would be completed\n\nand father said next week; father did not know how long the program usually took.\n\nFather admitted that on January 23, 2023, he drank three big cans of beer which was like\n\na six-pack. He was asked if drinking was recommended as part of his sobriety and he\n\nreplied, \u201cIt\u2019s not anything you know, I mean.\u201d He said he drank once in a while, not\n\nregularly.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} The court asked father about consuming alcohol, and observed that\n\ndrinking a six-pack at one time seemed to fly in the face of the sobriety issues, to which\n\nfather replied, \u201cI understand where you are coming from, yea. It was a six (6) pack but it\n\nwas between me and a friend you know, so, so what I had a total of you know.\u201d The\n\ncourt told father he just changed his testimony, and father said, \u201cUh, yea, I understand\n\nwhere, yea.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Father failed to bring documentation of his Guidestone treatment, but said,\n\n\u201cI talked to Lisa yesterday and she was going to fax over paperwork. I could actually get\n\nit faxed to [the caseworker] like soon as I leave here. That I have actually been going or\n\nyou know contact Lisa and have her get a hold of the caseworker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\f       {\u00b6 91} GAL Cook observed that based on father\u2019s testimony, his drug use was not\n\nseriously mitigated and there were many occasions when his sobriety was called into\n\nquestion, even by father\u2019s own testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6 92} The court allowed the parties time to file Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law, as to whether the cases should be dismissed since timeliness was not met, or\n\nwhether the court had jurisdiction so the cases could go to trial. The court recessed.\n\n              Judgment Entry on Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 93} The juvenile court found that it retained jurisdiction of the cases, and\n\ndenied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court\u2019s findings are more fully set forth\n\nbelow, under mother and father\u2019s first assignments of error.\n\n                            Mother\u2019s Motion to Return Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 94} On April 14, 2023, mother filed a motion to return custody of the children\n\nto her or to grant legal custody to paternal grandmother. In May 2023, mother withdrew\n\nher motion to grant legal custody of the children to paternal grandmother.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 1, May 19, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Two motions were before the court: the agency\u2019s motion for permanent\n\ncustody and mother\u2019s motion to return custody of the children to her. The court reserved\n\nits finding on mother\u2019s motion until after testimony was heard. The trial on the motion\n\nfor permanent custody trial proceeded. Mother attended the first, second and fourth days\n\nof trial, father did not attend the trial.\n\n\n\n\n24.\n\fSgt. Jason Sprague\n\n       {\u00b6 96} The sergeant was called as a witness by the Williams County prosecutor,\n\nand testified to the following. He worked for the Montpelier Police Department (\u201cMPD\u201d)\n\nand on December 11, 2019, he received a medical call that a person got out of bed and\n\ncollapsed on the floor. Upon arrival at T.V.\u2019s home, father, T.V., mother and mother\u2019s\n\ntwo older children were present. Father was on the floor, pale, snarling when he breathed\n\nand with an accelerated pulse rate, which were all general signs of an overdose. The\n\nsergeant was also aware of father\u2019s history of drug abuse, and it was suspected that father\n\nused heroin. Narcan was administered and eventually father became conscious.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} Father claimed he had a sleeping disorder and denied using drugs, even\n\nthough the sergeant explained that Narcan only disrupted an opioid overdose, and given\n\nfather\u2019s reaction to Narcan it was pretty obvious what happened. Father was given an\n\nimmunity letter, which gave a drug abuser 30 days to check into rehab or potentially face\n\ncriminal charges. Father did not go to rehab, nor was he criminally charged.\n\nLt. Darrell Higbie\n\n       {\u00b6 98} The lieutenant was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing. He worked for the MPD and on July 15, 2022, around noontime, he\n\nresponded to a med call that a male was breathing, but unresponsive. When Lt. Higbie\n\npulled up to the house, he recognized it and knew mother, father and T.V. lived there.\n\n\n\n\n25.\n\fFather was on the floor of the garage and life squad treated him for a possible drug\n\noverdose, due to a previous incident.\n\n       {\u00b6 99} Lt. Higbie spoke with T.V., who said father was at court that morning and\n\nhad to report to jail later that day. Mother arrived and was told father overdosed again.\n\nShe said father was not supposed to hang out with Troy Smith, who trafficked drugs.\n\nFather was revived with Narcan, and wanted to know what was going on. Father was\n\nasked what drugs he took; he said he did not take any drugs. Father was informed that\n\nNarcan only worked on opioid use, not heart attacks, strokes or epilepsy. The lieutenant\n\nlooked for evidence of drugs in the home, but found none. Father refused to go to the\n\nhospital, and was not charged with a crime.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} The lieutenant did not recall being told at the scene that father tested\n\npositive at court that morning for meth, amphet, THC and alcohol. Based on that\n\ninformation, Lt. Higbie believed that father did some type of opioid between the time he\n\nwas in court and the time he became unresponsive.\n\nPatrolman Austin Batt\n\n       {\u00b6 101} The officer was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and testified to the\n\nfollowing. He worked for the MPD and on January 22, 2023,4 he received a call for a full\n\n\n\n\n4\n Two dates were referenced regarding father\u2019s alleged overdose: January 22 and 23,\n2023. We will refer to January 23, 2023.\n\n\n\n26.\n\farrest, which was believed to be an overdose. The officer was advised that mother called,\n\nand she was performing CPR.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} Upon Officer Batt\u2019s arrival at the house, mother said father was dead and\n\nwas blue in the face. She accused father of using an illegal substance that he got at Circle\n\nK. Mother appeared normal but distraught, and she looked frustrated with father as she\n\nbelieved he used illegal drugs and overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The officer found father was alert and conscious, but heavily intoxicated.\n\nFather had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from his breath, there were white\n\ncrystal-like debris hanging out of his nostrils, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, his\n\nspeech was slurred, he was unable to have a conversation, he thought everything was\n\nfunny, he could not maintain his balance, and he had body tremors. Father admitted\n\ndrinking five 24-ounce cans of Milwaukee Ice Beer, but denied taking any illegal\n\nsubstances or overdosing. Father claimed he fell asleep and was epileptic; he did not\n\nmention a blood clot. Father\u2019s heart rate was high, which was an indicator of being under\n\nthe influence of a stimulant like meth or cocaine. Father was not given Narcan and he\n\nrefused to go the hospital. He was not criminally charged, as no drugs or paraphernalia\n\nwere found.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The officer recalled that father\u2019s cousin and a friend were also at the\n\nhouse and they both had indicators that they were under the influence, as they had\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\fbloodshot, glassy eyes, they had body tremors and could not maintain steady balance.\n\nThe cousin said father was unconscious, and the cousin breathed for father.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} Officer Batt believed mother and father were girlfriend and boyfriend, as\n\nthe officer stopped father\u2019s car the previous week for a traffic violation at which time\n\nfather said he was trying to get home, where he lived with mother.\n\nAttorney Abigail Wurm\n\n       {\u00b6 106} Wurm was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was an attorney for the estate of T.V., who died on December 13, 2022.\n\nMother and father lived at T.V.\u2019s home at the time of T.V.\u2019s death. T.V. had a will which\n\nprovided that five beneficiaries, including mother, were to split the estate.\n\n       {\u00b6 107} Mother was advised that she and father could stay at T.V.\u2019s home, and\n\npay the utilities, until mother was able to secure financing to purchase the home. Mother\n\ncould not get a loan, so on January 26, 2023, a thirty-day notice to vacate the home was\n\nserved. At that time, Wurm noticed a door hanger on the house which stated the village\n\nwould shut off utilities as of January 31, 2023. Wurm learned that mother and father had\n\nnot paid the utilities, as they promised. Wurm also learned the utilities were shut off.\n\n       {\u00b6 108} Wurm received verification that mother and father had vacated the home\n\non February 20, 2023; the locks on the home were changed and the home was listed for\n\nsale. When mother and father vacated the home, there was nothing left in the home; the\n\nstove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, all of the appliances were gone.\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\f       {\u00b6 109} Wurm testified that T.V. had a 2003 Chevy Trailblaze which showed up\n\non Facebook on January 23, 2023, as having been sold by father for $250. Wurm was not\n\naware that father had authorization to sell the vehicle, and she knew he did not have a\n\ntitle to the vehicle. A complaint against father was filed with the police department.\n\n       {\u00b6 110} Wurm estimated that mother may receive $15,000 to $18,000 when T.V.\u2019s\n\nestate closed, which was anticipated to be in the fall of 2023.\n\nJana Richards\n\n       {\u00b6 111} Richards was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was a counselor at Shalom Counseling and Mediation Center (\u201cShalom\u201d),\n\nand also was the supervised visitation coordinator and parenting instructor.\n\n       {\u00b6 112} Richards supervised the parents\u2019 visit with the children. Father was\n\nreferred for supervised visits at Shalom in May 2021, mother was referred in June 2021.\n\nRichards was instructed to schedule visits every other week, for two hours, but there were\n\ngaps in the visits due to mother\u2019s inpatient treatment and father\u2019s incarceration and\n\ninability to pay for visits. Visits ended in February 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Richards directed mother\u2019s parenting classes, which started with\n\norientation on April 8, 2021, and ended December 2, 2021, when mother completed the\n\nclasses. The gap between mother\u2019s orientation and classes was due to her positive drug\n\nscreen in late April 2021, and subsequent inpatient treatment.\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f       {\u00b6 114} As for father, he was referred for parenting classes on September 28,\n\n2022, and he completed two out of the ten required classes. After he missed two classes,\n\nhe was \u201cpulled from group and then he would have to start the next cycle.\u201d During\n\nsupervised visits with the children, father mentioned the parenting classes to Richards,\n\nand he was informed that he had to reach out to remind her at another time; he never did.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Richards\u2019 general observations of mother and father\u2019s visits with the\n\nchildren were \u201c[l]ots of love and affection * * * praise and encouragement,\u201d and there\n\nwere no issues with the parents at visits. Richards observed mother applying what she\n\nhad learned in parenting classes at the visits, definitely the positive aspects, although\n\nmother could improve on providing consequences for behaviors. Richards recommended\n\nunsupervised visits for mother and father with the children.\n\nLisa Michel\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Michel was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to the\n\nfollowing. She was a behavioral health counselor at Guidestone, formerly Renewed. She\n\nwas mother and father\u2019s counselor, although they saw other providers too. Mother was in\n\ngroup, while father saw the nurse and nurse practitioner.\n\n       {\u00b6 117} Mother had her assessment on September 28, 2022, and was directed to\n\ntake IOP and individual counseling; she did really great. Mother was drug screened,\n\nusually twice a week, and had no positive screens. Mother missed some appointments,\n\nbut it was not enough to be removed from the program, as she always contacted Michel\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fto let her know. Michel had no concerns with mother during her treatment, as every\n\nrecommendation was completed and mother was discharged on April 4, 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Father started services in April or May 2021, and was discharged on\n\nJune 1, 2021. He was in rehab for one day, June 8 to June 9, 2022, and went back, in\n\nOctober 2022, for counseling with Michel and medication assisted treatment (\u201cMET\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Father did well at first with counseling, but then missed appointments.\n\nDuring the fall of 2022 and winter of 2022-2023, he was supposed to go to Guidestone\n\nfour days a week, but from November 2022 through April 2023, he missed 24\n\nappointments and was removed from group. Father was drug screened by Michel twice a\n\nweek; he was positive for THC and alcohol on November 2, 2022, but had negative\n\nscreens thereafter.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} Father was in MET and on Suboxone from October 4, 2022 until\n\nDecember 1, 2022, when he was discharged for noncompliance. He was drug screened\n\nby MET and was positive on June 8, 2022, for meth, amphet, alcohol, fentanyl,\n\nnorfentanyl and THC, and on October 25, 2022, for THC and Hydromorphone.\n\n       {\u00b6 121} Father completed IOP, which had 36 sessions, but did not complete the\n\nstep-down, relapse prevention, which had 12 sessions and was part of the programming.\n\nIf father were to contact Michel, residential treatment would be recommended.\n\n\n\n\n31.\n\f       {\u00b6 122} Regarding mother and father\u2019s relationship, Michel was initially told they\n\nwere friends, then she found out they were together. In April 2023, mother told Michel\n\nthat she broke up with father.\n\n       {\u00b6 123} Michel was aware that father allegedly overdosed on January 23, 2023,\n\nand noted that he did not take a drug screen until January 26, 2023. She was asked if she\n\nwould challenge father\u2019s March 23, 2023 testimony, that he was very compliant with\n\nGuidestone and his treatment, as untruthful; Michel responded she would.\n\nJerome Pete Reed\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Reed was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was employed as a certified scientist with Forensic Fluids Laboratory\n\n(\u201cFFL\u201d), which specialized in oral fluid drug testing. He mentioned that drugs in the\n\nblood also affect saliva. Reed stated it was virtually impossible for FFL\u2019s tests to have a\n\nfalse positive. He also said you could not test positive for meth if you sat next to a user,\n\nkissed or had sex with a user.\n\n       {\u00b6 125} Reed recalled that FFL processed drug tests for mother, as requested by\n\nthe agency, and there were three positive results: on April 29, 2020, positive for oxy; and\n\non April 19 and May 28, 2021, positive for meth and amphet. He explained that the body\n\ntried to excrete meth by converting it to amphet, and with ADHD drugs, like Adderall, a\n\ndrug test would also be positive for amphet. Reed noted meth use could be detected in\n\noral fluid for up to about 18 hours.\n\n\n\n\n32.\n\f        {\u00b6 126} FFL processed drug tests for father, as requested by the agency, with the\n\nfollowing positive results: on May 10, 2021, positive for THC; on May 21, 2021, positive\n\nfor meth, amphet, THC, cocaine, Benzoylecgonine (\u201cBZE\u201d) and Ecgonine Methyl Ester\n\n(\u201cEME\u201d); on June 4, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC; on October 5, 2021,\n\npositive for THC; and on October 14, 2021, positive for meth, amphet and THC. Reed\n\nexplained that the body broke down cocaine into BZE, and then EME.\n\n        {\u00b6 127} Reed noted the medications father listed for November 2, 2021, were oxy\n\nand enoxaparin (which is a blood thinner, not used for epilepsy), yet father\u2019s drug test\n\nwas positive for meth, amphet and THC; no listed medications were found. On\n\nNovember 19, and December 16, 2021, father was positive for meth, amphet and THC;\n\non December 27, 2021, he was positive for Percocet (which is oxy), meth, amphet and\n\nTHC; on May 4, September 13 and October 26, 2022, he was positive for THC; and on\n\nMarch 23, 2023, father was positive for fentanyl.\n\n        {\u00b6 128} Reed explained that fentanyl use could be detected in oral fluid for up to\n\nabout 24 hours, and THC (by smoking marijuana) can be detected for up to 36 hours.\n\n        {\u00b6 129} Reed noted father had one negative result, which was on December 15,\n\n2022.\n\n        {\u00b6 130} Reed observed that it took an extensive amount of time of chronic drug\n\nuse to register a positive in a hair follicle test. Chronic drug usage would be several times\n\na week for several months before the drug would register on a hair follicle test.\n\n\n\n\n33.\n\fMelinda Reynolds\n\n        {\u00b6 131} Reynolds was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony she offered at the March 23, 2023 hearing on parents\u2019\n\nmotion to dismiss. In addition to that testimony, she testified to the following. At the\n\nagency, she worked as a social services supervisor where she oversaw the ongoing unit in\n\nall ongoing cases, and sometimes worked as an ongoing caseworker. She was the\n\nsupervisor for the family since April 1, 2021, and was assigned as the caseworker in\n\n2023. Four other agency employees had worked on the case at times, since August 18,\n\n2020.\n\n        {\u00b6 132} Regarding father\u2019s overdose in December 2019, the agency\u2019s notes\n\nshowed that mother\u2019s two oldest children and M.M. were present, and the oldest child\n\nand T.V. performed CPR on father. The agency opened a case, substantiated for physical\n\nabuse, but the case was not transferred to ongoing services and was closed.\n\n        {\u00b6 133} On April 29, 2020, the agency received a report that mother tested\n\npositive for illegal drugs while giving birth to B.M., but she denied the use of drugs other\n\nthan Zantac, Gabapentin and Amoxicillin. She admitted that father used THC, but\n\nclaimed no other substances were used in the home. On May 12, 2020, mother claimed\n\nshe did not realize she was in active labor so she took two Percocets for pain, and in the\n\nhospital, she was given oxy every six hours.\n\n\n\n\n34.\n\f       {\u00b6 134} Mother sent the agency an email on May 2, 2020, indicating she was not\n\ntogether with father, and he moved to Kentucky, as his other children were \u201cbeing\n\nadopted out.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 135} On May 28, 2020, mother was drug tested by the agency, and was positive\n\nfor meth and amphet; she denied ever using meth. Shortly afterwards, the children were\n\n\u201csafety planned\u201d with T.V., and case plans were created.\n\n                                        Case Plans\n\nGoal\n\n       {\u00b6 136} The initial, overall case plan goal was reunification of the family.\n\nHousing\n\n       {\u00b6 137} In April 2020, when the agency became involved with the family, mother\n\nlived at T.V.\u2019s home. On September 28, 2020, mother indicated that father was back in\n\ntown. On October 13, 2020, mother reported that father moved out and moved into his\n\nmother\u2019s house in Defiance, Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 138} On December 11, 2020, mother reported she bought a trailer and would\n\nmove in January 2021, which she did. On March 1, 2021, mother reported she had been\n\nback and forth between T.V.\u2019s home and the trailer, as she was working on getting the\n\nbathroom fixed. On April 22, 2021, a caseworker went to the trailer unannounced and\n\nfather opened the door; he became upset, refused a drug screen and refused to work with\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\fthe caseworker. On October 28, 2021, the agency learned that mother did not own the\n\ntrailer and that she moved to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 139} On October 26, 2022, father notified the agency that he lived with mother\n\nin T.V.\u2019s home and was no longer living in the trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 140} A March 25, 2023 police report indicated that mother and father were\n\nliving together on Vine Street in Sherwood, Ohio, but on April 17, 2023, father emailed\n\nthe agency that he was moving to Lexington, Kentucky. On April 21, 2023, mother\n\nreported that she did not live at T.V.\u2019s home; she stayed with friends or family or in her\n\ncar. Mother\u2019s address was requested for eight weeks, and the day before the May 19,\n\n2023 trial, mother emailed a signed a lease for the Vine Street trailer (\u201cVine trailer\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 141} Reynolds noted the agency only communicated with father via email, as\n\nthere were occasions when he was very threatening with a caseworker. Reynolds had not\n\nemailed father since April 2023, because he had responded to her emails with \u201cLOL\u201d\n\nwhen she asked him for his address or where he was. The day before trial, Reynolds saw\n\nthat father\u2019s Facebook post said he was in Fremont, Ohio.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 142} Reynolds was not able to conduct home visits in March, April or May,\n\n2023, for mother or father.\n\n\n\n\n36.\n\fEmployment\n\n      {\u00b6 143} Mother reported that she received $400 a month in SSDI, and the children\n\nalso received SSDI, which money was redirected to the agency. Reynolds believed that if\n\nmother had housing and the children were returned to her, she would get over $1,000 per\n\nmonth.\n\n      {\u00b6 144} Father reported, on May 24, 2021, that he worked at Mansion\u2019s; he\n\nprovided no verification. On October 4, 2021, he told the caseworker he received SSDI\n\nand did side jobs, and on October 15, 2021, he reported that he worked in Michigan; he\n\nprovided no verification. On November 25, 2021, he reported he injured his leg and was\n\nnot working.\n\n      {\u00b6 145} On May 4, 2022, father claimed he worked at a tire place by the Ford\n\ndealer in Bryan, Ohio; he provided no verification. On July 15, 2022, he indicated he\n\nworked at an oil change place in town; he provided no verification. In August 2022,\n\nfather was in jail and did not work. In November 2022, the agency received proof that\n\nfather collected SSDI.\n\n      {\u00b6 146} On January 23, 2023, father reported that he worked at CK Technologies;\n\nhe showed his ID badge and confirmed his employment.\n\n\n\n\n37.\n\fPRC Application\n\n        {\u00b6 147} Mother completed her application; it was approved in June 2021. Father\n\nwas given six applications before he completed one, which was approved in November\n\n2022.\n\nVisitation and Parenting Classes\n\n        {\u00b6 148} There were no issues with parents\u2019 supervised visits with the children,\n\nexcept that mother struggled to follow through with discipline. The agency gave the\n\nparents gas vouchers for visits with the children. By February 2023, parents were\n\nallowed additional visits, which were supervised by the foster mom. Mother was very\n\nrespectful with the foster parents, and father typically did not interact with them.\n\n        {\u00b6 149} Reynolds noted that generally when reunification is the goal, parents\n\nstarted with supervised visits, then moved to unsupervised visits to transition their\n\nchildren back into the home before their children returned home. However, mother and\n\nfather always had supervised visits because, throughout the case, mother was dishonest\n\nwith the agency about her relationship with father, so she did not build trust with the\n\nagency. Reynolds was aware that in January 2023, a joint motion was filed by the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s office requesting unsupervised visits for the parents, which showed it was\n\nnot the agency\u2019s decision for the parents to have supervised visits with the children.\n\n\n\n\n38.\n\f       {\u00b6 150} Mother attended and completed all required parenting classes by\n\nDecember 2021, while father attended two classes out of ten and never completed the\n\nparenting class goal.\n\nHome Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 151} The agency required visits with the parents every month, with home visits\n\nevery other month, some of which were unannounced; it was mandated that the agency\n\nmake three attempts a month for a home visit. The other visits were held at the agency or\n\na neutral site.\n\n       {\u00b6 152} For mother, home visits were unsuccessful in May and November 2022\n\nand February 2023, while visits were successful in July and December 2022 and January\n\n2023, but two attempts were be made before visits occurred. No home visits were\n\nattempted in March, April and May 2023, because mother did not provide her address to\n\nthe agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 153} With father, home visits were not successful in September, October,\n\nNovember and December 2020; January, April and July 2021; April, June and December\n\n2022; and January, February and April 2023.\n\nSubstance Abuse, Drug Screens and Mental Health Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 154} In November 2020, mother engaged in treatment at Recovery, disengaged\n\nin February 2021, and reengaged in March 2021. She was accepted at FIC in February\n\n2021. FIC was an intensive program, with four phases, starting with weekly meetings\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fbetween the parent and a treatment team of providers, which included the agency\u2019s\n\ndirector, then meeting every other week, then every three weeks, and finally, a meeting\n\nevery four weeks until the parent graduated and was discharged from the program.\n\nMother was unsuccessfully discharged from FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 155} In April 2021, mother was admitted for inpatient treatment at Serenity. In\n\nMay 2021, it was reported to the agency that mother was having regular contact with\n\nfather, she did not follow the rules when it came to father, and she appeared very co-\n\ndependent. In August 2021, mother was successfully discharged from Serenity.\n\n       {\u00b6 156} Mother tested positive for meth on September 1, 2021, but denied using;\n\nshe claimed she had sex with father the night before, which made the test positive. She\n\nalso was positive for meth on September 22, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b6 157} In December 2021, a contempt hearing was held because mother was\n\ntested by FIC and was positive for meth, twice. She was found in contempt and ordered\n\nto attend inpatient treatment.\n\n       {\u00b6 158} Mother was admitted to Serenity again, in January 2022, and released in\n\nApril 2022. On July 7 and 15, 2022, Recovery tested mother and she was positive for\n\nmeth; she denied using drug, and claimed her drink was spiked by her sister. In late\n\nSeptember 2022, mother informed the agency she switched services to Guidestone, and\n\nno longer wanted to go to Recovery or complete inpatient treatment. In April 2023,\n\nmother successfully completed treatment at Guidestone and was discharged.\n\n\n\n\n40.\n\f       {\u00b6 159} Father was assessed at Guidestone, in April 2021, and IOP was\n\nrecommended, but he failed to follow the recommendation. Father was referred to FIC, a\n\nmeeting was scheduled but he did not appear. Father was denied admission into FIC.\n\n       {\u00b6 160} In October 2021, father was assessed at Recovery and tested positive for\n\nmeth, amphet and THC; treatment was recommended. Father was discharged from\n\nRecovery in December 2021, due to lack of attendance.\n\n       {\u00b6 161} In January 2022, father requested to be removed from the case plan, as he\n\nwas facing contempt charges; he was removed. In March 2022, father asked to be placed\n\nback on the case plan; he was added to the case plan. The caseworker told father the\n\nagency wanted him to go to inpatient treatment, but he said he did not have time to do\n\nthat. Father also said he never wanted to be on the case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 162} In April 2022, father had another assessment at Guidestone and residential\n\ntreatment was recommended; he refused to go saying that place does not help and there\n\nare more drugs there than on the streets. In June 2022, father went to inpatient for one\n\nday, then disengaged from services until he was assessed again at Guidestone in October\n\n2022. IOP was recommended, but father quit attending all services in March 2023.\n\n       {\u00b6 163} Father refused to drug test for the agency in: August 2020; April 2021;\n\nMarch 2022; and January 2023, following the alleged overdose.\n\n\n\n\n41.\n\f                                   Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 164} Mother and father claimed on numerous occasions that they were not in a\n\nrelationship, but the agency believed otherwise. When mother was in Serenity for the\n\nfirst time in the spring of 2021, she had contact with father and it appeared, at that time,\n\nthat she had no intention of ending her relationship with him. In August 2021, mother\n\nindicated to the agency she had broken up with father, but in a jail video from\n\nSeptember 23, 2021, she told father she was going to tell the court what it wanted to hear,\n\nwhich was that they broke up, but she had no intention of breaking up and throwing away\n\nfive years.\n\n       {\u00b6 165} On October 15, 2021, mother told the agency she and father were together\n\nand possibly moving to Michigan. On December 3, 2021, mother reported that she had\n\nbroken up with father, and on April 6, 2022, she said she was finished with him for good.\n\n       {\u00b6 166} On April 26, 2022, the agency received a police report stating that father\n\nwas charged with falsification for pawning a gun in Defiance, Ohio. Father indicated to\n\nthe officer that the gun belonged to his girlfriend (mother), but he pawned it because she\n\ndid not have her license on her at the time. Later, father requested the gun back and filled\n\nout an ATF form which reflected that he had no previous misdemeanor domestic violence\n\ncharges, but father had a domestic violence conviction in Bryan, Ohio, and it was\n\npresumed that mother was the victim. Reynolds knew it was illegal, under federal law,\n\nfor father to own a firearm. Father admitted that he lied on the form, and faced charges.\n\n\n\n\n42.\n\fReynolds was concerned that father had a firearm, as he had made threats against the\n\ncourt and the agency, saying he would blow that place up and they are all going to pay; it\n\nwas unclear to which place father was referring. Reynolds also learned of domestic\n\nviolence accusations made against father in Kentucky by his other children\u2019s mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 167} Reynolds noted that the parents were seen together at Wal-Mart in April\n\n2022, father asked the children at a visit if they saw the puppy that he and mother bought\n\ntogether, and through most of the case, mother used father\u2019s last name on Facebook.\n\n       {\u00b6 168} Mother was told at the March 23, 2023 hearing that if she was not with\n\nfather, she could potentially have the children returned to her. Father had a Facebook\n\npost saying he and mother had broken up and were living separately. However, Reynolds\n\nlearned from father\u2019s mother that from March through May 2023, the parents lived\n\ntogether.\n\n                                 Parents\u2019 Other Children\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Mother has two older children, and one child\u2019s biological father had legal\n\ncustody.\n\n       {\u00b6 170} Father had two older children, but his parental rights were involuntarily\n\nterminated for these children in August 2020, in Kentucky.\n\n                                     Foster Parents\n\n       {\u00b6 171} The children were the same foster parents since the emergency removal in\n\nDecember 2021. The children were happy, settled and very bonded with the foster\n\n\n\n\n43.\n\fparents, they go on vacations together. The children have their own beds, own rooms,\n\nown toys and own clothes at the foster home. The foster parents wished to adopt the\n\nchildren. The foster parents communicated with X.H.\u2019s foster parents and the children\n\nhave regular contact with X.H., which would continue if the agency were granted\n\npermanent custody of the children.\n\n                                        Opinions\n\n       {\u00b6 172} Reynolds opined it would be disruptive to the children, especially M.M.,\n\nif there were a placement change. In Reynolds\u2019 training she learned that every move for\n\na child was traumatizing, and children who were disrupted constantly or had placement\n\nchanges were more likely to have mental health issues, more likely to struggle in school,\n\nand less likely to go to college.\n\n       {\u00b6 173} Reynolds\u2019 opined it would be in the children\u2019s best interests for them to\n\nbe placed in the permanent custody of the agency, and for the permanency goal to be\n\nchanged to adoption. Reynolds believed if the children were returned to mother, CPS\n\nwould likely have to continue its involvement, and the children would continue to have\n\nplacement disruptions and changes. The children needed a legally secure, permanent\n\nplacement.\n\nThomas Custer\n\n       {\u00b6 174} Tom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified to the\n\nfollowing. He was father\u2019s stepfather and was married to Debbie Custer, father\u2019s mother,\n\n\n\n\n44.\n\ffor 14 years. Tom did not know the children well, he thought M.M. may know him and\n\nDebbie, but B.M. had only been to the Custer home twice. The Custers did not have\n\nvisits with the children while they were in foster care, because \u201cit was two (2) years\n\nbefore we even knew they were there.\u201d Tom learned the children were in foster care two\n\nor three months prior to trial when the agency contacted him and Debbie about taking\n\ncustody. Tom said he and Debbie were older and had too many health issues to run after\n\nand raise little kids.\n\n       {\u00b6 175} The Custers had a close acquaintance-type relationship with mother, and\n\nTom thought she was a good parent. Tom has a \u201clabored\u201d relationship with father; if\n\nfather got what he wanted, he was good to be around, but if father got mad, he was a\n\nwhole different person - angry and making threats. Tom tried to keep his distance from\n\nfather, as father threatened to beat Tom up, mop the floor with him and put him in a pine\n\nbox. Tom said he and his wife were not afraid of father, Tom just does not want the\n\ndrama. Tom recalled that father said the Defiance Police stopped by, and father talked\n\nwith them.\n\n       {\u00b6 176} Tom remembered that from January 2023, until about a month ago when\n\nthe Custers told the agency they would not take the children, mother and father were at\n\nthe Custer home two or three times a week, and father came out one time without mother.\n\nTom said mother and father took showers at the Custer home. After father was notified\n\n\n\n\n45.\n\fthat the Custers would not take the children, he threatened Debbie, so she blocked him on\n\nthe phone and everything.\n\n        {\u00b6 177} In about April 2023, when mother called Debbie and asked for Narcan,\n\nTom overheard the call. Mother said she was out and when she got home, she found\n\nfather comatose and she did not know what he did or took. Debbie told mother to take\n\nfather to the hospital or call 911. A few hours later, mother and father arrived at the\n\nCuster home and father had slurred speech, \u201ca little balance,\u201d and was under the influence\n\nof something. Tom said father drank, but did not admit to doing drugs. Tom said he\n\ndoes not believe that father knew what the word \u201chonesty\u201d meant, as father had a\n\ndelusional version of the truth. Tom said father had five children, with three women.\n\nTom thought father knew how to manipulate mother, and was good at it.\n\n        {\u00b6 178} Tom saw mother the day before trial when she came out to the Custer\n\nhome to retrieve the children\u2019s clothes, dressers, car seats and things. The items were at\n\nT.V.\u2019s home, but were moved to the Custer home when mother and father left T.V.\u2019s\n\nhome.\n\n        {\u00b6 179} Tom saw and talked to father the morning of trial, at the Vine trailer.\n\nTom went to get his ladder and rake which he lent to father, as \u201cthere was a big falling\n\nout.\u201d Tom and his brother found the Vine trailer because a dresser mother picked up the\n\nnight before \u201csat right there.\u201d The two men went to the back door, which was unlocked,\n\n\n\n\n46.\n\fand opened it; the brother said someone was inside, so Tom looked and father \u201cpopped\n\nout and he started doing the [father] thing.\u201d Father said he just woke up.\n\n       {\u00b6 180} Tom told the prosecutor, when he talked to her the previous weekend, that\n\nmother and father were still together, and lived together on Vine Street. However, when\n\nTom spoke to mother the night before trial, she said father left.\n\n       {\u00b6 181} Tom does not know what mother and father\u2019s living arrangement was, but\n\nfather told Tom that he and mother had slept in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Father said\n\nmother bought a trailer after T.V. died, and father was fixing it up. Tom said after T.V.\n\npassed away and mother and father had to move out of T.V.\u2019s home \u201cthe world flipped\n\nupside down.\u201d Mother and father asked to stay at the Custer home and were told no,\n\nalthough Tom said mother was welcome anytime, but without father.\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Tom talked to mother the day of trial during a smoke break, and she asked\n\nTom what father was doing at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 183} Tom believed the children should be returned to mother, but should not be\n\nreturned to father.\n\nFoster mom\n\n       {\u00b6 184} Foster mom was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and she testified to\n\nthe following. She was a married, third-grade teacher and her husband was a pipefitter.\n\nThe children have lived with the foster parents for one and a half years; M.M. was three\n\nyears old and B.M. was one when they entered foster care. At first, M.M. cried a lot and\n\n\n\n\n47.\n\fit took time for her to get used to the foster parents and daycare centers, but she really\n\nimproved. B.M. was a go-with-the-flow kid, so the transition was easier for him.\n\n       {\u00b6 185} M.M. was silly and all girl, and she liked to do girl stuff with foster mom.\n\nM.M. and foster dad were the silliest together, as foster dad was the play around person,\n\nand M.M. loved to hang out with him. M.M. was really loving with the foster parents, as\n\nwas B.M., who was also very cuddly. The children loved to go outside to play with\n\nfoster dad, they rode bikes and scooters, played and hiked in the woods, took the dog for\n\na walk, and swam and went to the zoo in the summer.\n\n       {\u00b6 186} The children improved a lot, especially their speech, as the foster parents\n\nworked with them since they arrived. Daycare helped the children improve socially and\n\nalso helped their speech. The children were really good with other kids. B.M. was in\n\nHead Start, and the children both had IEPs for speech at their school in Bowling Green.\n\n       {\u00b6 187} Foster mom was pregnant with her first child. The children are treated as\n\npart of the foster family, they were very bonded to each other, they played really well\n\ntogether for the most part, and slept in the same room, as they did not want to be\n\nseparated.\n\n       {\u00b6 188} The foster parents wanted to adopt the children, as they were a part of the\n\nfamily for almost two years, and the foster parents were definitely comfortable keeping\n\nthe children long-term.\n\n\n\n\n48.\n\f       {\u00b6 189} Foster mom believed if M.M. were disrupted again and moved around,\n\nback and forth, it would be hard and confusing on her to adjust to different settings. With\n\nB.M., foster mom would be concerned about his behavior, because when B.M. met\n\nsomeone new at daycare, he had behaviors, but \u201cafter they kind of get his number, he\u2019s\n\nbetter.\u201d Foster mom was worried that B.M. would develop poor behaviors if he was\n\naround different adults and had to go back and forth.\n\n       {\u00b6 190} Recently, foster mom supervised visits between the children and mother\n\nand father; foster mom and mother made the arrangements. Outside of visits, foster mom\n\nhad no contact with father. The visits were roughly every two weeks for two hours or so,\n\nat a place like the park or McDonald\u2019s. Mother was very loving towards the children and\n\nthey were excited to see her, but they got a little wild and hyped-up with father, which\n\nwas not that concerning. The children were bonded with mother and father, and talked\n\nabout them all of the time. X.H. was also at visits, as his foster parent brought him. The\n\nchildren loved to see X.H., and he was very sweet and caring to them. X.H. came to\n\nB.M.\u2019s birthday party at the foster home, and was really great with the kids. If the foster\n\nparents adopted the children, visits with X.H. would continue. Foster mom believed the\n\nchildren needed consistency and that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to remain with\n\nthe foster parents permanently.\n\n\n\n\n49.\n\f                   Permanent Custody Trial - Day 2, May 22, 2023\n\nGAL\n\n       {\u00b6 191} GAL Cook was called as a witness by the prosecutor, and he testified\n\nconsistently with the testimony he offered at previous hearings. The GAL also testified\n\nthat the children needed a legally secure, permanent placement, and permanent removal\n\nfrom mother and father was probably in the children\u2019s best interests, as were permanent\n\ncustody and adoption.\n\nMelinda Reynolds\n\n       {\u00b6 192} Reynolds testified about the children\u2019s previous placements with family\n\nmembers, and the efforts made to try to place the children permanently or long-term with\n\nrelatives.\n\nMother\n\n       {\u00b6 193} Mother testified to the following.\n\n                                  Parents\u2019 Relationship\n\n       {\u00b6 194} Around the time of B.M.\u2019s birth, mother and father were off and on, and\n\nnot \u201csolely together.\u201d After B.M. was born, father took off. She was unaware that father\n\nhad his parental rights to two children terminated in 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 195} Mother acknowledged that some time before the September 2021 jail\n\nphone call between her and father, she was probably told she should not be with father if\n\nshe wanted the children back.\n\n\n\n\n50.\n\f       {\u00b6 196} In the fall of 2022, mother was on and off with father, and \u201call I wanted to\n\ndo was give him the benefit of the doubt and change for his children. * * * I like stayed\n\naway for a while and he kept coming back saying oh he\u2019s going to change. You know\n\nhe\u2019s going to do this, he\u2019s going to do that, but * * * he never did.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 197} At the March 2023 court hearing, mother told father \u201cif you fail this drug\n\nscreen, I\u2019m done. Like I\u2019m done done. I can\u2019t do it no more. * * * I\u2019m tired of looking at\n\nsomebody that\u2019s saying you know that they\u2019re clean and sober to my face but in reality\n\nthey\u2019re lying. I\u2019m done with it.\u201d She claimed that she ended her relationship with father\n\n\u201c[a] few days later after I got the positive drug screen from [the agency].\u201d She admitted\n\nshe was a little fearful that father may hurt her, as \u201che\u2019s made threats to me as well in the\n\npast but nothing you know, physical really. * * * I want to invest in pepper spray just in\n\ncase if something was to happen. I don\u2019t want no firearm, no nothing you know that\n\ncould be potentially dangerous for my children to be in reach of.\u201d When asked about the\n\ngun that father sold, she admitted it was her gun but claimed she did not have much to do\n\nwith it, since she was in Serenity at the time.\n\n       {\u00b6 198} Mother was asked about the foster mom\u2019s testimony that for the last two\n\nvisits, mother and father arrived together; she replied, \u201cNo. The last visit which was on\n\nthe * * * (12th) I was there waiting on [the foster mom.] [Father] wasn\u2019t even there.\n\n[M.M.] asked where her daddy was and I said I didn\u2019t know. About * * * (5) minutes\n\nlater he come walking up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n51.\n\f       {\u00b6 199} Mother was asked about Facebook messenger and text messages between\n\nher and father; she said there were no texts and she messaged him on Facebook to \u201csend\n\nhim odd jobs, that\u2019s it. On Facebook. You know try to help him make money that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nShe did not know the last time she messaged him \u201c[c]ause my phone, I don\u2019t have\n\ninternet so when I get internet, like in Sherwood it spaces out and I something I click one\n\nperson and it pops up another person. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m about to just get rid of the\n\nphone completely and go back to flip phone.\u201d She claimed she did not have internet on\n\nher phone or at the Vine trailer.\n\n       {\u00b6 200} Mother was asked if she married father, as indicated on Facebook, and she\n\nreplied, \u201cNo, absolutely not. * * * At one point we were engaged [in 2017]. The whole\n\nsituation with Facebook and my name. I was illiterate. I\u2019m not going to lie. I could not\n\nfor the life of me figure out how to change my last name back to [her maiden name]. But\n\nthat is my legal name.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 201} Mother claimed the domestic violence committed against her by father in\n\n2018 \u201cwas more verbal. It wasn\u2019t physical.\u201d Father was ordered by the court to have no\n\nviolent or threatening contact with mother and to complete Thinking for a Change, and he\n\nwas placed on probation, which he unsuccessfully completed.\n\n                                           Visits\n\n       {\u00b6 202} At the time of trial, S.O., was in JRC [Juvenile Residential Center] in\n\nBowling Green; mother thought he was charged with \u201crape one * * *. And I don\u2019t know\n\n\n\n\n52.\n\fif it was gross sexual.\u201d She believed the victim lived in the home with S.O. Mother\n\ntalked to S.O. \u201conce a week. I video Zoom him when my internet wants to work once a\n\nweek and I can see him once a week in person.\u201d She did not see S.O. every week\n\n\u201cconsidering it\u2019s an hour away and my funding is kind of short because of everything\n\nright now but I do go see him when I can.\u201d She had not seen S.O. in person for three\n\nweeks.\n\n         {\u00b6 203} Mother stated she had every intention of starting unsupervised visits with\n\nthe children, maybe in October 2022, when T.V. was still alive. She was ready for the\n\nchildren, as \u201cI had the beds made. I had the beds put together. Everything for\n\n[caseworker Alaina] to come check it out to start doing unsupervised visits. I never once\n\ngot an email, call, anything for her to say hey I\u2019m not able to make it to get these\n\nunsupervised visits.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 204} Mother was asked if she picked up father for parenting time, and she said\n\nshe did not and she also did not tell him when the visits were, but \u201c[w]ith my car issues\n\nlike when I go to Bowling Green or even you know, from Sherwood to Bryan I let\n\nsomebody know where I\u2019m going and usually it\u2019s a third party that relays the message to\n\nhim.\u201d\n\n                                         Home Visits\n\n         {\u00b6 205} Testimony was presented that it was sometimes difficult to reach mother,\n\nto which she responded, \u201c[i]n November my grandpa was diagnosed with SCLC which is\n\n\n\n\n53.\n\fsmall cell lung cancer in June of * * * (2022). From that day until December * * * (13th)\n\nthe day that he had passed away, I was his sole provider, caretaker. * * * So like when\n\nthey were to come to the house, I could have very well been in Toledo with my grandpa\n\nfor his [chemo] treatment.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 206} Mother was asked who took care of T.V. while she was in jail for 30 days\n\nin August and September 2022, and she replied, \u201c[m]y mom would come and check in,\n\nyou know every couple days. I talked to him on the phone every day just to make sure,\n\nyou know, he was still okay.\u201d\n\n                                       Employment\n\n       {\u00b6 207} Mother did not have a job, but \u201cI try to do whatever I can, like on the side\n\nas like a gig job just to get extra money.\u201d She helped people with yard pick-up and she\n\nbabysat. Mother\u2019s only health problem was her back, which limited her employment\n\noptions because she could not stand for long periods of time.\n\n                                     Drugs/Treatment\n\n       {\u00b6 208} Mother was questioned about hospital records which indicated B.M.\n\nshowed signs of withdrawal at birth and she tested positive for oxy, meth and amphet, but\n\nshe denied drug use. She said \u201c[t]hey never asked me.\u201d She admitted that she used drugs\n\nduring her pregnancy \u201c[j]ust one time. That was it. One time. * * * And honestly I think\n\nthat\u2019s what put me into labor. Because he wasn\u2019t supposed to be due till actually May * *\n\n* (19th).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n54.\n\f       {\u00b6 209} As to positive drug screens, mother said, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a lot of honesty *\n\n* * throughout this case. I did make a poor choice. * * * I don\u2019t have a desire to even go\n\nback to that [drug use].\u201d She acknowledged she went to Serenity twice for inpatient\n\ntreatment, and went back the second time \u201c[b]ecause I failed another drug screen.\u201d She\n\nsaid the second time was helpful as she was able to work on her mental state to get out of\n\nthe extreme depression and high anxiety that she had.\n\n       {\u00b6 210} Mother claimed she had a rough time with FIC and felt like she went\n\nnowhere, so she failed to complete it.\n\n       {\u00b6 211} Mother called Debbie (father\u2019s mother) in or about April 2023, and asked\n\nfor Narcan for father who was \u201c[n]ot horribly\u201d comatose, as his eyes were open and \u201che\n\ncould walk but not a whole lot.\u201d Mother stated that earlier that day, they went to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201chad a really bad headache and she [Debbie] gave him medicine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was. I don\u2019t know anything because I wasn\u2019t even in that room. * *\n\n* Then we left and later on I called. For Narcan because I don\u2019t know what she gave\n\nhim. Obviously, she\u2019s got Narcan for a reason. Is it something she gave, did she give\n\nhim her medication? * * * I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mother did not call 911, although she drove\n\nfather to the hospital, but he would not get out of the car. Then, they returned to the\n\nCuster house and father \u201cwas completely fine. Like his speech was still a little slurred.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n55.\n\f       {\u00b6 212} Mother admitted she used meth, as \u201cI, you know I have went through\n\ndown a rough path of like emotional distraught, physical, mental and like, I worked my\n\nway out of that to be where I am right now.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 213} Mother also admitted that the agency helped her quite a bit, as the agency\n\nwas \u201cworking with me to try and save my children. The only thing like I get would be\n\nlike the proper housing and more assistance. Like I only get * * * ($23) a month in food\n\nstamps. Half of my check is gone because of my kids, paying for them. How am I\n\nsupposed to even, but I do that\u2019s why I try to get any kind of side job I can make a little\n\nextra money for. And put it towards bills or extra food or something. But I\u2019m going to\n\nreapply for food stamps * * * today. * * * You know I hit up the food banks, I\u2019m not\n\nashamed to hit up you know a food bank.\u201d\n\n                                     Alleged Overdoses\n\n       {\u00b6 214} Regarding the December 2019 incident, mother said she was present, as\n\nwas T.V., S.O., X.H. and M.M. After she found father on the bedroom floor, not\n\nbreathing and blue she \u201cwas on the phone. I had by daughter cause like I was freaking\n\nout. I had my daughter she was screaming in one * * * ear, I was on the phone with 911\n\non the other ear and my grandpa yelled for [S.O.] to come in and help him [with CPR].\u201d\n\nMother said S.O. was traumatized, but \u201cat the same time he was like mom I just saved\n\nsomebody\u2019s life. I\u2019m like, I understand that but I mean you really shouldn\u2019t have to,\n\nyou\u2019re only you know * * * (12) years old. * * * Or younger at the time.\u201d She did not\n\n\n\n\n56.\n\fbelieve that X.H. saw father, as X.H. was in the living room with her. Mother told the\n\npolice that father used heroin in the past. After father was revived, he claimed he was\n\njust sleeping and had a sleeping disorder, which mother said was \u201c[a] little bit of sleep\n\napnea, not like a whole lot.\u201d Mother now believed that father overdosed.\n\n       {\u00b6 215} As to the January 23, 2023 incident, mother admitted father drank and\n\nwent to the gas station with his cousin and wife. About 15 minutes after they got home,\n\nmother was told to call 911 because father was not breathing. She called 911 and\n\naccused father of overdosing, but she said \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have accused him but I\n\nmean, I didn\u2019t know what else to do or think or say. And it just kind of like, I just\n\nreframed back to before.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 216} Mother claimed the people with father \u201cactually are on medication. There\n\nwere not on anything,\u201d and they did CPR on father, but \u201cno Narcan was used that time.\n\nNothing was.\u201d She believed father told the police that he had epilepsy. Mother honestly\n\ndid not know if the January 2023 incident was an overdose.\n\n                                          Housing\n\n       {\u00b6 217} Mother moved out of T.V.\u2019s home in early February 2023, and admitted\n\nthat she took the appliances because: the washer was old and \u201ccould break down at any\n\ngiven time\u201d; she helped to buy the dryer in 2010; the stove was bought in 2005, so it was\n\nan older appliance; and she paid for most of the refrigerator, which was scratched and\n\ndented and smashed on the one side.\n\n\n\n\n57.\n\f       {\u00b6 218} Mother was asked why she did not correct father\u2019s testimony, given at the\n\nMarch 2023 hearing, that they still lived at T.V.\u2019s home, and she replied, \u201cI, I should\n\nhave, I know. But it was more of like a pride thing. Like I\u2019m here on behalf of my kids I\n\ndon\u2019t want anything more used against me and being in a motel obviously wasn\u2019t a\n\ncredential to have my, get my children back. Cause you know like I don\u2019t want to\n\njeopardize more than what I have already lost. * * * I was kind of like in a stuck\n\nposition.\u201d Mother and father were at the motel for about two months.\n\n       {\u00b6 219} The first week or two of April 2023, mother and father looked for a place\n\nto live, found the Vine trailer online and \u201c[t]he guy was trying to give it away or for it to\n\nbe moved and we talked him into just renting it. * * * Because it was too old to be\n\nmoved.\u201d Mother and father were going to get the Vine trailer together, but they had a big\n\nargument, and he took off so she took it over. Mother produced a copy of the Vine trailer\n\nlease, effective May 1, 2023, which she signed the previous week although the lease was\n\ndated April 7, 2023, \u201cwhen we had started working on it and I had started you know\n\nputting more and more into getting it fixed up.\u201d Mother did not put any money into the\n\nVine trailer as the landlord paid for everything.\n\n       {\u00b6 220} Concerning the Vine trailer, prior to May 1, 2023, mother claimed she\n\npaid a $500 deposit and $500 rent \u201c[b]y saving and doing these odd, odd jobs for people.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged she only received $400 in SSDI.\n\n\n\n\n58.\n\f       {\u00b6 221} Mother was asked about a police report that stated on April 12, 2023,\n\nfather was at the Vine trailer. She claimed she was in Bryan, Ohio at that time and had\n\nno idea that the police were there. She later stated that she called the sheriff, upon advice\n\nof counsel, and the police \u201ctrespassed\u201d father. She said father did not have a key, but\n\n\u201c[t]he back door doesn\u2019t really lock so all you have to do * * * is just turn it, but I fully\n\nintend on getting that fixed. By getting a new door. Like this week.\u201d Mother claimed\n\nthat she did not know father was at the Vine trailer because \u201cwe had no heat there at the\n\ntime. I was hardly there.\u201d Mother did not agree with Tom\u2019s testimony that as of last\n\nweekend, she and father lived together at the Vine trailer, nor did she agree that she and\n\nfather went to the Custer home together, until about a month ago.\n\n       {\u00b6 222} Mother was asked about stable housing and replied, \u201cIt does seem like\n\nyou know, I, I was bouncing around you know for a little bit. But one thing that even\n\nbefore this started, my kids had stability. I had my own place before any of this case\n\neven started. And then I moved in with my grandpa briefly and then I moved to\n\nFreemont, Ohio where I had my own place. I moved back because my grandpa got\n\nlonely. * * * When I got this place in Bryan [the trailer], yea, it took a lot of money * * *\n\nto fix it up. But at the end of the day I still had a home to go to which was my grandpa\u2019s.\n\nThe kids had a home to go to. A safe, proper, suitable home. When he passed away you\n\nknow it interrupted a lot of things in life * * * [a]nd I freaked out. I was staying * * * at a\n\nmotel, * * * [in] the car sometimes you know friends, but you know as of right now I\n\n\n\n\n59.\n\fhave a home. I don\u2019t intend on losing that home.\u201d Mother recognized that the\n\ncaseworker and GAL did not visit the Vine trailer, because they were unaware where she\n\nlived, as she \u201chad just got the place. I wanted to make sure it was up to their * * *\n\nstandards before I contacted anyone.\u201d\n\n                      Juvenile Court\u2019s Finding \u2013 Mother\u2019s Motion\n\n       {\u00b6 223} At the end of the second day of trial, the court denied mother\u2019s motion to\n\nreturn custody of the children to her.\n\n                                GAL Filing - June 2, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 224} Closing Argument/Proposed Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law were\n\nfiled by GAL Cook.\n\n                    Permanent Custody Trial - Day 3, June 5, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 225} Witnesses were called to testify regarding X.H.\n\n                     Permanent Custody Trial - Day 4, June 30, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 226} No witnesses were called to testify. The court addressed the issues\n\nregarding the procedural timetable and the GAL\u2019s lack of adherence to Sup.R. 48, with\n\nrespect to X.H. The court found X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity to be included in the case\n\nplan was insufficient, thus the court denied the permanent custody motion as to X.H. only\n\nand dismissed X.H.\u2019s case.\n\n\n\n\n60.\n\f                                 Permanent Custody Law\n\n       {\u00b6 227} A juvenile court\u2019s decision in a permanent custody case will not be\n\nreversed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.

In re A.H. at \u00b6 15. Here, the court found R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and those factors are:\n\n       (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and\n\n       notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency\n\n       to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to\n\n       be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and\n\n       repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be\n\n       placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have\n\n       substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental\n\n       utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and\n\n       rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to\n\n       the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to\n\n       resume and maintain parental duties.\n\n\n\n\n62.\n\f      (2) Chronic * * * chemical dependency of the parent that is so severe that it\n\n      makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\n      child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year after the court\n\n      holds the hearing pursuant to division (A) of this section * * *;\n\n      (3) The parent committed any abuse as described in section 2151.031 of the\n\n      Revised Code against the child, caused the child to suffer any neglect as\n\n      described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code, or allowed the child to\n\n      suffer any neglect as described in section 2151.03 of the Revised Code\n\n      between the date that the original complaint alleging abuse or neglect was\n\n      filed and the date of the filing of the motion for permanent custody;\n\n      (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by\n\n      failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able\n\n      to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an\n\n      adequate permanent home for the child;\n\n      ***\n\n      (11) The parent has had parental rights involuntarily terminated with\n\n      respect to a sibling of the child pursuant to this section * * * or under an\n\n      existing or former law of * * * any other state * * * that is substantially\n\n      equivalent to those sections, and the parent has failed to provide clear and\n\n      convincing evidence to prove that, notwithstanding the prior termination,\n\n\n\n\n63.\n\f       the parent can provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate\n\n       care for the health, welfare, and safety of the child.\n\n       {\u00b6 230} As to the second prong, the best interest of the child, when making this\n\ndetermination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) provides that the court \u201cshall consider all relevant\n\nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s\n\n       parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and\n\n       any other person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n       the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n       or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n       consecutive twenty-two-month period * * *;\n\n       (d) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent\n\n       custody to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n       apply in relation to the parents and child.\n\n       {\u00b6 231} Here, the court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(11) applied.\n\n\n\n\n64.\n\f                               Juvenile Court\u2019s Judgment\n\n       {\u00b6 232} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court issued its judgment entry, in which it\n\ngranted permanent custody of the children to the agency. The court\u2019s overall findings\n\nand conclusions are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 233} The court detailed the history of the cases, including: father\u2019s alleged\n\noverdose in the presence of mother\u2019s three oldest children, followed by two more alleged\n\noverdoses; B.M.\u2019s premature birth, mother\u2019s positive drug test and her denial of drug use;\n\nthe initial concerns with mother, including illegal drug use, lack of stable housing, mental\n\nhealth issues, an unhealthy and detrimental relationship with father, which issues were\n\nnot satisfactorily resolved, despite numerous services offered to her; father\u2019s failure to\n\nmake substantial progress on any of his case plan goals and his continued use of illegal\n\ndrugs; the parents\u2019 drug use; the parents\u2019 lack of credibility with the agency and the court,\n\nabout their relationship, drug use, housing and more, all to the detriment of the safety and\n\nwell-being of the children, who were young and unable to protect themselves.\n\n       {\u00b6 234} The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the GAL, who\n\nwas appointed at the inception of the cases, testified that the children were of young age\n\nand were bonded with their parents and their foster family, and it was in the best interests\n\nof the children that the motion for permanent custody be granted and mother and father\u2019s\n\nparental rights be terminated. The court found the GAL did not comply, in total, with\n\nSup.R. 48, as reports were not timely filed and certain responsibilities were not fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\n65.\n\fThe court found that while no party objected to or complained about the GAL, it was the\n\ncourt\u2019s responsibility to oversee the GAL. The court found that from the time the\n\ncomplaints were filed through trial, it had regular and frequent contact with mother and\n\nfather, at the hearings where testimony related to the parents and the children, was\n\nreceived, and due to mother\u2019s involvement with FIC. The court found that due to its\n\nfrequent contacts with the parents, significant weight was not given to the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations, thus any deficiencies in the GAL\u2019s performance were harmless. The\n\ncourt found the evidence on which it relied was significant enough to stand alone.\n\nFirst Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 235} The court found, in accordance with R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), the children\n\ncannot or should not be placed with the parents. The court found R.C. 2151.414(E)(1),\n\n(2), (3), (4) and (11) applied, and further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n\n(1) the children were placed outside of the home, and notwithstanding reasonable case\n\nplanning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy their problems\n\nwhich caused the children\u2019s removal from the home, each parent failed continuously and\n\nrepeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions which caused the children to be placed\n\noutside of the home; (2) father\u2019s chemical dependency was so severe that he was unable\n\nto provide an adequate permanent home for the children at the present time, and it was\n\nnot anticipated that he could remedy that within one year after the court\u2019s hearing; (3) the\n\nparents allowed the children to suffer abuse and neglect, from the date that the complaints\n\n\n\n\n66.\n\fwere filed through trial; and (4) each parent demonstrated a lack of commitment to the\n\nchildren by showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the\n\nchildren. The court also found father\u2019s parental rights were involuntarily terminated to\n\ntwo half-siblings of the children, and he failed to provide clear and convincing evidence\n\nto prove that, notwithstanding the prior terminations, he could provide a legally secure\n\npermanent placement and adequate care for the health, welfare and safety of the children.\n\nSecond Statutory Prong\n\n       {\u00b6 236} The court made the following findings, in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), that: permanent custody was in the best interest of the children, and in\n\ndetermining the best interest of each child, the court considered all credible evidence\n\nrelated to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship of the children with the parents,\n\nsiblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who\n\nmay significantly affect the children; (2) the custodial history of the children, including\n\nwhether the children were in the agency\u2019s temporary custody for 12 or more months in a\n\nconsecutive 22-month period; (3) the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement, and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency; and (4) whether any of the factors in R.C.\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) applied; the court found (E)(11) applied, as father had his parental\n\nrights involuntarily terminated to two half-siblings of the children.\n\n\n\n\n67.\n\f       {\u00b6 237} The court further found that the children were placed with a foster family\n\nsince their removal in December 2021, and the foster family wished to adopt the children.\n\nThe evidence showed that the children were doing well in their foster home, and were\n\nstable, safe and meeting their developmental milestones. The children were bonded with\n\nthe parents and foster family, and the children had regular visits with the parents and\n\nX.H. The foster mom testified she and her husband intended to have the children\n\ncontinue their relationship with X.H., and maintain regular contact.\n\n       {\u00b6 238} The court found, in considering all of the best interests factors, there was\n\nclear and convincing evidence presented that the children cannot and should not be\n\nplaced with either parent, and it was in the best interest of each child that permanent\n\ncustody be granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 239} The court ordered mother and father\u2019s parental rights, privileges and\n\nresponsibilities to the children were terminated. The court further ordered that permanent\n\ncustody of the children was granted to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 240} Mother and father appealed.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s First Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 241} Mother argues the juvenile court abused its discretion when it denied the\n\njoint motion to dismiss. She sets forth two issues:\n\n\n\n\n68.\n\f         Issue One: The trial court erred when it decided that mother failed to\n\n         substantially mitigate or rectify the circumstances which caused the\n\n         children\u2019s removal.\n\n         Issue Two: The motion for permanent custody was filed outside the two-\n\n         year time limit of R.C. 2151.353(G).\n\n                                  Father\u2019s Assignment of Error\n\n         {\u00b6 242} Father argues the juvenile court erred when it granted the motion for\n\npermanent custody because the original complaint had been filed more than two years\n\nprior.\n\n                                         R.C. 2151.353\n\n         {\u00b6 243} R.C. 2151.353(G) states:\n\n         Any temporary custody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier\n\n         of the date on which the complaint in the case was filed or the child was\n\n         first placed into shelter care, except that, upon the filing of a motion\n\n         pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the temporary custody\n\n         order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a dispositional\n\n         order under that section. In resolving the motion, the court shall not order\n\n         an existing temporary custody order to continue beyond two years after the\n\n         date on which the complaint was filed or the child was first placed into\n\n         shelter care, whichever date is earlier * * *.\n\n\n\n\n69.\n\f              Judgment Entry - Joint Motion to Dismiss - April 20, 2023\n\n       {\u00b6 244} The juvenile court denied the parents\u2019 motion to dismiss the motion\n\npermanent custody filed by the agency. The court\u2019s findings are summarized below.\n\n       {\u00b6 245} The court found that mother and father have a significant drug history, as\n\nevidenced throughout the pendency of the cases where they struggled with substance\n\nabuse and had positive drug screens. The court found \u201c[t]he parties have been less than\n\nhonest with the Court and with the Agency,\u201d and their \u201ccredibility was compromised\n\nthrough statements that they made in their testimony concerning their use of illegal\n\nsubstances, their relationship with each other and whether they resided together, and for\n\nextensive periods of time one or both evaded the Agency.\u201d The court stressed \u201c[t]he\n\ncompromise of their credibility is taken as a significant factor in this Decision.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 246} The court cited R.C. 2151.353(G), and observed the parents argued the\n\nagency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed outside of the time frame prescribed by\n\nstatute, and should be dismissed and the children returned to the parents. The court\n\ndeclined to address the issue, as it was not \u201ccentral to this Motion due to Ohio case law.\u201d\n\nThe court referred to In re Young Children, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6774573\"><a href=\"/opinion/6881578/in-re-young-children/\">76 Ohio St.3d 632</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">669 N.E.2d 1140</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1996), and noted parents\u2019 counsel \u201call agree[d] and acknowledge[d]\u201d the case which\n\nheld that \u201calthough the Agency filed its Motion for Permanent Custody outside the\n\nstatutory guidelines, the Court can make dispositional orders relating to the children if the\n\n\n\n\n70.\n\foriginal problems that were present at the time of the filing of the complaints have not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 247} The court found \u201c[d]uring the pendency of this case, both [parents] were\n\nheld in contempt for failing to comply with the Court\u2019s Order adopting the case plan. The\n\nbasis of both parents\u2019 contempt was that they failed to follow the treatment\n\nrecommendations of their individual providers.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 248} The court concluded the original facts which led to the filing of the\n\ncomplaints were not mitigated, because mother continued her relationship with father and\n\nlived with him. As such, the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions\n\nimpacted on each other. The court found it retained jurisdiction, and denied the parents\u2019\n\nmotion.\n\n                            Mother and Father\u2019s Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 249} We will first address portions of Issue One and all of Issue Two, along\n\nwith father\u2019s assignment of error, as similar arguments are presented.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Relevant Arguments and Issue Two\n\n       {\u00b6 250} Mother offers a timeline of the children\u2019s cases: July 13, 2020, complaints\n\nfiled; December 30, 2021, the children removed; January 31, 2022, mother consented to\n\nagency\u2019s temporary custody; December 30, 2022, agency filed motion to return the\n\nchildren to mother, within R.C. 2151.414(A) time period; and January 31, 2023, agency\n\nfiled for permanent custody, outside of R.C. 2151.414(A) time period.\n\n\n\n\n71.\n\f        {\u00b6 251} Mother argues the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody was filed\n\noutside of the two-year time limit in R.C. 2151.353(G). She contends temporary custody\n\nwas granted on January 31, 2022, but the agency filed no motions until December 30,\n\n2022, when the agency filed to return the children or extend temporary custody. Mother\n\nasserts this is outside of the two-year deadline from the date the complaints were filed in\n\nJuly 2020, thus the juvenile court erred when it denied mother\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n        {\u00b6 252} Mother submits that no matter when the clock started ticking, with the\n\nfiling of the complaints or when the agency was granted temporary custody, the agency\n\ndid not file for permanent custody within the one year \u201csunset date,\u201d in R.C.\n\n2151.353(G). She also claims the agency did not file its motion for permanent custody\n\none month prior to the termination of the temporary custody order, pursuant to R.C.\n\n2141.415(A).\n\n        {\u00b6 253} Father argues the two-year deadline in R.C. 2151.415(D)(4) is steadfast\n\nand has been applied by courts as a definite deadline. He cites to In re L.B., 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 112407, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023-Ohio-2392</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Father contends he filed a motion to dismiss\n\nthe cases because the complaints were filed more than two years prior, on July 13, 2020,\n\nand the motion for permanent custody was filed January 30, 2023. He claims \u201c[i]t is\n\ncommon knowledge that two years equals 730 days, and here, 931 days had passed.\n\nFather submits the agency allowed more 200 days to elapse before filing, which is too\n\nlate.\n\n\n\n\n72.\n\f                                    Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 254} An abuse of discretion indicates the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable,\n\narbitrary or unconscionable.

In that case,\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio held \u201cthe passing of the sunset date pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.353(F)5 does not divest juvenile courts of jurisdiction to enter dispositional orders.\u201d\n\nId. at 637. The court further found:\n\n               The obligation to file a motion [for permanent custody] thirty days\n\n       prior to the sunset date is not vitiated and the failure to file is not harmless\n\n       error. * * * Accordingly, although the court has continuing jurisdiction,\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The version of R.C. 2151.353(F) in effect at that time, provided: Any temporary\ncustody order * * * shall terminate one year after the earlier of the date on which the\ncomplaint in the case was filed or the child was first placed into shelter care, except that,\nupon the filing of a motion pursuant to section 2151.415 of the Revised Code, the\ntemporary custody order shall continue and not terminate until the court issues a\ndispositional order under that section.\n\n\n\n73.\n\f       temporary custody terminates when the sunset date passes without a filing\n\n       pursuant to R.C. 2151.415(A). However, because the court retains\n\n       jurisdiction over the child, it may make further dispositional orders as it\n\n       deems necessary to protect the child. * * *\n\n              This holding allows the juvenile court to assess each situation on its\n\n       merits and does not mandate the return of children to a situation from\n\n       which they originally needed protection solely because the agency charged\n\n       with their care missed a filing deadline. Thus, we hold that when the sunset\n\n       date has passed without a filing pursuant to R.C. 2151.415 and the\n\n       problems that led to the original grant of temporary custody have not been\n\n       resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts have the discretion to make a\n\n       dispositional order in the best interests of the child. Where the original\n\n       problems have been resolved or sufficiently mitigated, courts may not make\n\n       further dispositional orders based on the original complaint. Id. at 638.\n\n       {\u00b6 257} We find, in accordance with the In re Young decision, the juvenile court\n\nhad the authority to exercise its discretion, after the sunset date, to make a dispositional\n\norder in the best interests of the children upon finding that the parents had not remedied\n\nthe problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody.\n\n\n\n\n74.\n\f       {\u00b6 258} We now turn to the remaining arguments in mother\u2019s Issue One, that the\n\njuvenile court erred when it found she had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated her\n\noriginal problems.\n\nIssue One\u2019s Remaining Arguments\n\n       {\u00b6 259} Mother argues the evidence shows that she sufficiently mitigated her\n\nproblems, as the agency was ready to return the children to her in December 2021, prior\n\nto the grant of temporary custody. However, because she tested positive for meth on\n\nDecember 8 and 10, 2021, an emergency custody hearing was held on December 30,\n\n2021, \u201c[y]et [the agency] still considered her \u2018compliant\u2019 with all [of] the rest of the case\n\nplan, and noted that the previous eight random drug screens were negative.\u201d (Emphasis\n\nsic.) Shortly thereafter, the court granted temporary custody of the children to the\n\nagency.\n\n       {\u00b6 260} Mother asserts \u201c[t]he parties kept arguing that the \u2018sufficiently mitigated\u2019\n\ntest was to look at the conditions alleged in the original complaint[s],\u201d which \u201callowed\n\nthe court to examine whether [father] had sufficiently mitigated because allegations were\n\nmade regarding his drug use in [the] complaint[s].\u201d But mother claims \u201cas happened in *\n\n* * In re Young * * * a new complaint for temporary custody was filed in December\n\n2021, which as in In re Young, \u2018established its own sunset date because it was based on\n\nfacts learned subsequent to the filing of the original complaint.\u2019 Id. at 638-639.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n75.\n\f       {\u00b6 261} Mother contends the juvenile court \u201cmust have examined the conditions\n\nwhich led to [the agency\u2019s] filing for temporary custody,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen temporary\n\ncustody was granted, [father] was no longer on a case plan * * * [so] his conditions\n\nshould not have been examined under the [sufficiently mitigated] Young test.\u201d She insists\n\nthe juvenile court should have only considered her two positive meth screens, her\n\nsubsequent eight negative screens and her successful completion of inpatient treatment\n\nfor the second time. She claims, taking the case history as a whole, she showed she \u201cwas\n\nsuccessfully in recovery and was committed to being sober and continuing supportive\n\ntreatment.\u201d\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 262} Upon review, we find that, pursuant to In re Young, the juvenile court\n\nproperly exercised its discretion by making a dispositional order in the children\u2019s best\n\ninterests, when the evidence in the record clearly supported its ruling that mother and\n\nfather\u2019s original problems which led to the initial grant of temporary custody, had not\n\nbeen resolved or sufficiently mitigated after the sunset date had passed.\n\n       {\u00b6 263} Mother\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included: struggling with illegal drug use, she tested positive for\n\nmeth twice the month prior; continuing to be involved with father, a known drug user;\n\nand not being truthful or cooperative, as she repeatedly denied using drugs and denied\n\n\n\n\n76.\n\fbeing in a relationship with father. At the time the sunset date passed, mother had not\n\nresolved or sufficiently mitigated her problem with drugs, lying and father.\n\n         {\u00b6 264} Father\u2019s problems at the time that temporary custody of the children was\n\ngranted to the agency included repeated use of illegal drugs, positive drug screens and not\n\nbeing truthful or cooperative with the agency or court. At the time that the sunset date\n\npassed, father had not resolved or sufficiently mitigated his problem with drugs and\n\nlying.\n\n         {\u00b6 265} We find no abuse of discretion by the juvenile court. Accordingly, we\n\nfind mother\u2019s first assignment of error not well-taken and father\u2019s sole assignment not\n\nwell-taken.\n\n                          Mother\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\nMother\u2019s Arguments\n\n         {\u00b6 266} Mother argues the juvenile court erred by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. She notes the court, in its final judgment entry, stated\n\nit did not place significant weight on the GAL\u2019s report, and that any deficiencies in the\n\nGAL\u2019s performance were harmless. Mother asserts the GAL\u2019s report concerned X.H.,\n\nnot the children, thus she \u201cwas severely prejudiced by being unaware of the GAL\u2019s\n\nrecommendations and reasons for [the children] before the hearing.\u201d She further argues\n\nthe GAL\u2019s testimony in lieu of a report was minimal and, as the trial court found, done in\n\nnear-complete failure to observe the requirements of the GAL report and [Sup.R.] 48.\n\n\n\n\n77.\n\f       {\u00b6 267} Mother contends \u201c[t]he GAL\u2019s complete failure to file a report on [the]\n\nchildren, or adequately investigate the children and [mother], should have warranted\n\ndismissal of the matter as to [the children]. She claims \u201c[i]f the errors were fatal to the\n\ncase as to X.H., then the errors should be found even more fatal here.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 268} Mother submits that \u201c[p]ermitting or not striking the GAL\u2019s testimony\n\nregarding [the] two children constitutes plain error.\u201d She maintains \u201cthe GAL\u2019s oral\n\nreport, which he stated was in lieu of a written report, was deficient and non-compliant\n\nwith Sup.R. 48 and the Williams County local rules. This is not harmless error as the\n\ntrial court found.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 269} In support, she cites to In re A.S., 10th Dist.

The court had additional contact with mother when she was a participant\n\nin FIC. The court recognized that due to its repeated contacts with the parents, it did not\n\ngive significant weight to the GAL\u2019s recommendations, as the evidence on which it relied\n\nwas significant enough to stand alone.\n\n       {\u00b6 278} The record further reveals that during the time that the children\u2019s cases\n\nwere pending, GAL Cook filed seven reports and after the first day of trial, he filed\n\nClosing Argument/Proposed Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law. The record also\n\nshows that throughout the cases, five agency employees worked on the cases at various\n\ntimes. The employees reported their dealings with the children and parents to the court,\n\nand some of the employees also shared their opinions and beliefs concerning the\n\n\n\n\n81.\n\fchildren\u2019s best interest. In addition, the children\u2019s foster mom provided the court with\n\ninformation concerning the children, their well-being and their visits with the parents, and\n\nshe shared what she thought was in the children\u2019s best interests.\n\n       {\u00b6 279} Given the applicable law, and the state of the record including the ample\n\nevidence regarding the children\u2019s best interests, exclusive of the GAL\u2019s trial testimony,\n\nwe find the juvenile court did not commit plain error by not dismissing the children\u2019s\n\ncases based on the GAL\u2019s failures. Moreover, we find the dismissal of X.H.\u2019s case does\n\nnot in any way affect the children\u2019s cases or warrant the dismissal of the children\u2019s cases,\n\nas X.H.\u2019s case was dismissed because the juvenile found that X.H.\u2019s father\u2019s opportunity\n\nto be included in the case plan for X.H. was insufficient.\n\n       {\u00b6 280} Accordingly, mother\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                               Third Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 281} Mother argues \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s decision to grant permanent custody and\n\nfinding that it was in the children\u2019s best interests was not supported by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.\u201d She contends she substantially remedied the conditions which\n\ncaused the children to be placed outside of the home, but emergency custody was granted\n\nbased on her two out of ten positive drug screens in one month. She claims she \u201chad\n\nbeen sober for almost one year and had completed the case plan at the time of trial,\u201d and\n\nbut for being with father, the children would have been returned to her.\n\n\n\n\n82.\n\f       {\u00b6 282} Mother asserts \u201cshe did not allow the children to suffer abuse and neglect\n\nsince the filing of the complaint and motion for permanent custody, as \u201cthe caseworkers\n\ntestified that [mother] was bonded to the children and visitations were going very well.\u201d\n\nYet, \u201cthe trial court found that her \u2018continued use of illegal drugs\u2019 and the two inpatient\n\ntreatment stints constituted neglect.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) This is irrational and unreasonable,\n\nshe argues, since the court ordered her to \u201cperform both inpatient treatments; to have the\n\ntrial court\u2019s orders warrant a finding of neglect is an abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 283} Mother maintains that she showed commitment and a willingness to\n\nprovide a permanent home, and at the time of trial, \u201cshe had obtained new housing and\n\nsubmitted evidence that the home was appropriate and safe.\u201d She claims she was no\n\nlonger with father \u201cand the court should have found that she was no longer living with\n\nhim * * * [and her] parental rights should not hinge upon whether [he] could follow a\n\ncase plan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 284} Mother argues as to \u201cthe children\u2019s best interests: the GAL\u2019s deficiencies\n\nand total lack of a report render the GAL\u2019s opinion on this point useless; however, the\n\nGAL did testify that \u2018absolutely\u2019 there was a detriment to the children in severing their\n\nbond with [mother].\u201d Mother \u201crequests this Court review the statutory best interest\n\nfactors and find that permanent custody is not in the children\u2019s interest, as their mother\n\nhad made a permanent and appropriate home and had rectified the conditions that led to\n\nremoval.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n83.\n\f                                         Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 285} On July 12, 2023, the juvenile court filed a 17-page judgment entry in\n\nwhich it granted permanent custody of the children to the agency, and terminated mother\n\nand father\u2019s parental rights to the children. In so ruling, the court summarized the\n\nextensive evidence presented, cited to and relied upon the applicable law, indicated which\n\nfactors it considered and offered well-reasoned explanations for the decision it rendered.\n\nFirst Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 286} We have carefully reviewed the record, which we conclude contains clear\n\nand convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that the children cannot\n\nand should not be placed with either mother or father, as both parents repeatedly and\n\ncontinuously failed to remedy the conditions which caused the children\u2019s removal from\n\nthe home, despite reasonable case planning, a multitude of case plan services and diligent\n\nefforts by the agency offered to assist the parents to remedy their problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 287} Throughout the agency\u2019s involvement with the family, the main concerns\n\nwere the parents\u2019 drug use, relationship and housing. Both parents used illegal drugs,\n\nwhich was confirmed by countless positive drug screens, yet both denied drug use for the\n\nmajority of the cases. The court ordered mother and father to partake in drug treatment\n\nprograms, yet drug use continued; father used regularly, mother used more sporadically.\n\nThe parents\u2019 relationship was concerning, largely due to their drug use. By the parents\u2019\n\naccounts, their relationship was on and off, however, since the parents were often not\n\n\n\n\n84.\n\fhonest with the court or the agency, which was revealed in their jail communications and\n\ninconsistent statements and testimony, the status of their relationship was not always\n\nknown. Housing was a concern as it was rarely stable and appropriate, because mother\n\nand the children frequently moved between the trailer and T.V.\u2019s home and father moved,\n\nsometimes with the children, from trailers, to relatives, to Kentucky and to T.V.\u2019s home.\n\nIt was never really known when the parents lived together, as they were not always\n\nhonest and forthcoming with the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 288} We further conclude that clear and convincing evidence in the record\n\nsupports the juvenile court\u2019s findings that both parents exhibited a lack of commitment to\n\nthe children due to their unwillingness to provide an adequate, permanent home for the\n\nchildren, due to father repeatedly failing and/or refusing to engage in substance abuse\n\ntreatment and other case plan requirements, and due to mother repeatedly choosing her\n\nrelationship with father over the needs and safety of the children. Mother was constantly\n\nadvised that the court viewed the parents as a couple and their actions impacted on each\n\nother, and that reunification could only occur if she ended her relationship with father.\n\nTime and again mother said she understood, but chose father and prioritized him over the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b6 289} Although mother successfully completed many of her case plan services,\n\nshe failed to change her behaviors; she still used illegal drugs on occasion and continued\n\nher relationship with father. She also defied court orders, was found in contempt of court\n\n\n\n\n85.\n\fand was jailed. Same with father. Thus, the original conditions which led to the filing of\n\nthe complaints, continued to the detriment of the children.\n\nSecond Prong Findings for Permanent Custody Award\n\n       {\u00b6 290} We have thoroughly reviewed the record, and we conclude it contains\n\nclear and convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that it was in the\n\nchildren\u2019s best interests for permanent custody to be awarded to the agency.\n\n       {\u00b6 291} The record shows the juvenile court considered the interaction and\n\nrelationships of the children with mother, father, caregivers and relatives, the children\u2019s\n\ncustodial history and the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement.\n\n       {\u00b6 292} The record further reveals that since the children were removed from the\n\nhome in December 2021, they have been with the same foster family and were stable,\n\nsafe and doing well. The children, who were bonded with the parents and foster family,\n\nhad regular visits with the parents and X.H., which were supervised by the foster mom.\n\nThe foster parents wished to adopt the children, and intended to continue the children\u2019s\n\nrelationship with X.H.\n\n       {\u00b6 293} Based on the foregoing and the abundance of evidence in the record,\n\nincluding the agency\u2019s numerous reports and the GAL reports, we find mother\u2019s third\n\nassignment of error not-well taken.\n\n\n\n\n86.\n\f       {\u00b6 294} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Williams County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.

Meeks appeals the judgment of the Williams County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, convicting him following his guilty plea to five sexual offenses\n\ninvolving minors and sentencing him to an indefinite term of six to nine years in prison.\n\nFor the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\f                    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} On November 9, 2021, the Williams County Grand Jury returned a 31-count\n\nindictment against Meeks, charging him with one count of importuning in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.07(D)(2) and (F)(3),1 a felony of the fifth degree; one count of pandering\n\nobscenity involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(1) and (C), a felony of the\n\nsecond degree; 20 counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) and (C), felonies of the second degree; and nine counts\n\nof illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(1)\n\nand (B), felonies of the second degree. The charges stemmed from Meeks\u2019 online\n\nconduct in soliciting and possessing child pornography.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On November 14, 2022, Meeks entered a guilty plea to the count of\n\nimportuning in violation of R.C. 2907.07(D)(2) and (F)(3), a felony of the fifth degree;\n\nthe count of pandering obscenity involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(1)\n\nand (C), a felony of the second degree; and three amended counts of pandering sexually\n\noriented matter involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), felonies of the\n\nfourth degree. The trial court accepted Meeks\u2019 plea, found him guilty, and continued the\n\nmatter for preparation of a presentence investigation report.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court heard statements in mitigation from\n\nMeeks and his counsel. Meeks accepted responsibility for his conduct and expressed\n\n\n1\n  R.C. 2907.07 was amended effective April 4, 2023. The citations in this case refer to\nthe prior version in effect at the time of Meeks\u2019 offense.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fremorse, stating that it occurred during a dark time in his life. He promised that it would\n\nnever happen again. He also noted that he has no felony criminal record and no\n\nsubstance abuse issues, but he recognizes his need for mental health services. Finally, he\n\nstated that he has family support and the ability to sustain gainful employment.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Thereafter, upon consideration of the record, the statements in mitigation,\n\nand the principles and purposes of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and\n\nrecidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12, the trial court sentenced Meeks to serve 11 months in\n\nprison on the count of importuning, six to nine years in prison on the count of pandering\n\nobscenity involving a minor, and 17 months in prison on each of the three amended\n\ncounts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor. The trial court further\n\nordered the prison terms to be served concurrently, for a total indefinite prison term of six\n\nto nine years.\n\n                                   II. Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 6} Meeks timely appealed his judgment of conviction and asserts one\n\nassignment of error for review:\n\n                 1. Mr. Meeks\u2019 sentence is not contrary to law, but it is clearly and\n\n       convincingly not supported by the record.\n\n                                          III. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Felony sentences are reviewed pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), which\n\nprovides, in pertinent part,\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\f              The appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a\n\n       sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and\n\n       remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing. The appellate\n\n       court\u2019s standard for review is not whether the sentencing court abused its\n\n       discretion. The appellate court may take any action authorized by this\n\n       division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of the following:\n\n              (a) That the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings\n\n       under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of\n\n       section 2929.14, or division (I) of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code,\n\n       whichever, if any, is relevant;\n\n              (b) That the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Here, none of the findings under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) are applicable; thus,\n\nMeeks must demonstrate that his sentence is \u201cotherwise contrary to law\u201d under R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(b). \u201cContrary to law\u201d means \u201c\u2018in violation of statute or legal regulations\n\nat a given time.\u2019\u201d State v. Goode, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-22-012, 2023-Ohio-863, \u00b6 6,\n\nquoting State v. Jones, 163 Ohio St.3d 242, 2020-Ohio-6729, 169 N.E.3d 649, \u00b6 34; see\n\nalso State v. Bryant, 168 Ohio St.3d 250, 2022-Ohio-1878, 198 N.E.3d 68, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Meeks, however, acknowledges that his sentence is not contrary to law.\n\nInstead, he argues that his sentence is too lengthy in light of the record and the statutory\n\nguidelines. Specifically, Meeks cites the factors under R.C. 2929.12(B) and (C)\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fdemonstrating that his conduct is \u201cless serious,\u201d not \u201cmore serious.\u201d He also cites the\n\nfactors under R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E) demonstrating that he is less likely, not more\n\nlikely, to commit future offenses. Thus, he asks this court to reconsider his sentence and\n\nimpose community control or a shorter prison term.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Meeks requests relief that the statute does not provide. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)\n\n\u201cdoes not permit an appellate court to conduct an independent review of a trial court\u2019s\n\nsentencing findings under R.C. 2929.12 or its adherence to the purposes of felony\n\nsentencing under R.C. 2929.11\u201d State v. Reynolds, 6th Dist. Sandusky Nos. S-22-022, S-\n\n22-023, 2023-Ohio-2624, \u00b6 10, quoting Bryant at \u00b6 21; see also Jones at \u00b6 41-42. Thus,\n\nthis court cannot review the trial court\u2019s finding and weighing of those factors, and his\n\nassignment of error on this issue may be summarily denied. State v. Bowles, 2021-Ohio-\n\n4401, 181 N.E.3d 1226, \u00b6 8, 10 (6th Dist.), citing State v. Toles, 166 Ohio St.3d 397,\n\n2021-Ohio-3531, 186 N.E.3d 784, \u00b6 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Accordingly, Meeks\u2019 assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                      IV. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 12} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Williams County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas is affirmed. Meeks is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to\n\nApp.R. 24.\n\n                                                                        Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f                                                                               State of Ohio\n                                                                          v.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                 I. Background and Facts\n\n       {\u00b6 2} Eames was indicted in two separate cases on a total of 33 charges. In case\n\nNo. 2022CR0045 (\u201ccase 1\u201d), Eames was charged with one count of grand theft in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(4), a third-degree felony; seven counts of petty\n\ntheft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree misdemeanor;\n\nseven counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a fifth-degree\n\nfelony; and ten counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a fifth-\n\ndegree felony. In case No. 2022CR0046 (\u201ccase 2\u201d), Eames was charged with two counts\n\nof petty theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree\n\nmisdemeanor; three counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a\n\nfifth-degree felony; and three counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and\n\n(B)(2), each a fifth-degree felony.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Eames and the state reached an agreement under which Eames agreed to\n\nplead guilty to 32 of the original charges and pay restitution, and the state agreed to\n\ndismiss the grand theft charge and not oppose Eames\u2019s request for intervention in lieu of\n\nconviction (\u201cILC\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In August 2022, Eames pleaded guilty in both cases. As part of his pleas,\n\nEames agreed to pay 16 of his 23 victims a total of $8,309.55 in restitution, jointly and\n\nseverally with his codefendant. In case 1, he agreed to pay $5,247.62 to 12 victims; in\n\ncase 2, he agreed to pay $3,061.93 to four victims. The trial court accepted Eames\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fpleas, found that Eames was eligible for ILC and willing to comply with the conditions of\n\nan intervention plan, placed him under the supervision of the probation department for\n\none year, stayed all criminal proceedings against him, and imposed conditions of\n\nsupervision. Among the conditions of his intervention plans were requirements that he\n\npay total restitution of $5,247.62 in case 1 and $3,061.93 in case 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In April 2023, following two ILC violations that Eames stipulated to, the\n\ntrial court terminated Eames\u2019s ILC. At the hearing, after considering Eames\u2019s behavior\n\nwhile on ILC, along with the principles and purposes of sentencing and the applicable\n\nseriousness and recidivism factors, the court terminated Eames\u2019s term of ILC and found\n\nhim guilty of the 32 charges he pleaded to in August 2022. In case 1, the court imposed\n\nprison terms of six months on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and\n\nten months on each identity fraud count. In case 2, the court imposed prison terms of six\n\nmonths on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and ten months on each\n\nidentity fraud count. The court ordered all of the sentences to run concurrently, for an\n\naggregate sentence of ten months. The court also ordered Eames to pay restitution of\n\n$3,061.93 in case 2 and \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} The trial court\u2019s sentencing entries generally reflected its actions at the\n\nsentencing hearing. However, in the entry for case 1, the trial court ordered Eames to pay\n\n$5,247.62 in restitution. This is the amount in the plea agreement and judgment entry\n\ngranting Eames\u2019s request for ILC, but is not \u201cthe same amount\u201d as case 2, as the court\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fordered at the sentencing hearing. The entry for case 2 included an order to pay\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Eames now appeals, raising two assignments of error:\n\n              I. The trial court abused its discretion in sentencing Appellant to a\n\n       prison term which was not supported by the record which is an abuse of\n\n       discretion and plain error.\n\n              II. The trial court erred when it ordered the payment of restitution.\n\n                                     II. Law and Analysis\n\nA. We cannot review the trial court\u2019s application of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and\n                                     2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion and committed plain error by sentencing him to ten months in prison because\n\n\u201cthe record does not support the severity of the sentence imposed[,]\u201d which shows that\n\nthe court did not properly consider the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. In response,\n\nthe state points out that we are precluded by State v. Jones, 163 Ohio St.3d 242, 2020-\n\nOhio-6729, 169 N.E.3d 649, from reviewing the trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C.\n\n2929.11 and 2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Generally, we review sentencing challenges under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). The\n\nstatute allows us to increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence or vacate the\n\nsentence and remand the matter for resentencing only if we clearly and convincingly find\n\neither (1) the record does not support the trial court\u2019s findings under specified Revised\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fCode sections not at issue here, or (2) the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(a)-(b). Notably, under the statute, \u201c[t]he appellate court\u2019s standard for\n\nreview is not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n\n       {\u00b6 10} However, since the Ohio Supreme Court decided Jones, the law governing\n\nappellate review of a trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 in imposing\n\nsentence is clear: \u201cR.C. 2953.08(G)(2) does not permit an \u2018appellate court to\n\nindependently weigh the evidence in the record and substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrial court concerning the sentence that best reflects compliance with R.C. 2929.11 and\n\n2929.12.\u2019\u201d State v. Bowles, 2021-Ohio-4401, 181 N.E.3d. 1226, \u00b6 7 (6th Dist.), quoting\n\nJones at \u00b6 42; see also, e.g., State v. Johnson, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-20-056, 2021-\n\nOhio-2139, \u00b6 14, citing State v. Orzechowski, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-20-029, 2021-\n\nOhio-985, \u00b6 10; State v. Woodmore, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-20-1088, 2021-Ohio-1677, \u00b6\n\n17. Moreover, we may summarily dispose of an assignment of error that is based only on\n\nthe trial court\u2019s consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. See Bowles at\n\n\u00b6 8, citing State v. Toles, 166 Ohio St.3d 397, 2021-Ohio-3531, 186 N.E.3d 784, \u00b6 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Eames\u2019s only arguments under this assignment of error relate to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, which we cannot\n\nreview. Accordingly, based on the authority of Jones and Toles, we summarily find that\n\nEames\u2019s first assignment of error in not well-taken. Bowles at \u00b6 9, citing Toles at \u00b6 11\n\n(Brunner, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       B. The restitution amounts in the sentencing entries are not reversible.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} In his second assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court erred\n\nwhen it ordered him to pay restitution because the amount of restitution that it ordered at\n\nthe sentencing hearing was not the same as the amount it put in the sentencing entries,\n\nand the court did not consider his ability to pay restitution.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The state responds that Eames is barred by R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) from\n\nappealing the restitution order because he stipulated to the amount of restitution when he\n\npleaded guilty and the amount of restitution was included in the plea agreement that he\n\nsigned. It contends that a trial court is not required to state the amount of stipulated\n\nrestitution in open court for the order to be valid, and the court put the correct amounts in\n\nits sentencing entries, which is what matters. It also argues that the trial court is not\n\nrequired to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution when the defendant agrees to\n\nthe amount of restitution.\n\n               1. We can consider the merits of this assignment of error.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} First, we address the state\u2019s argument that Eames\u2019s appeal is precluded by\n\nR.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Our general ability to review a felony sentence is eliminated when\n\nthe defendant and prosecutor jointly recommend a sentence, the sentencing judge\n\nimposes the recommended sentence, and the sentence is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d R.C.\n\n2953.08(D)(1). \u201cA sentence is \u2018authorized by law\u2019 and is not appealable within the\n\nmeaning of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) only if it comports with all mandatory sentencing\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fprovisions.\u201d State v. Underwood, 124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923,\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus. Under R.C. 2929.18(A), a sentencing court\u2019s decision to\n\norder restitution is discretionary. State v. Lalain, 136 Ohio St.3d 248, 2013-Ohio-3093,\n\n994 N.E.2d 423, \u00b6 23. But, if the court chooses to impose that sanction, R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1) contains mandatory provisions that the court must follow. State v. Brant,\n\n6th Dist. Huron No. H-15-013, 2016-Ohio-5274, \u00b6 18, citing State v. Burns, 2012-Ohio-\n\n4191, 976 N.E.2d 969, \u00b6 19 (6th Dist.). Among those mandatory provisions are ordering\n\nrestitution in open court and determining the amount of restitution at sentencing. R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Additionally, although not specifically related to restitution, Crim.R.\n\n43(A)(1) requires a defendant to be physically present (unless appropriate arrangements\n\nare made for the defendant to appear by video) at every stage of a criminal proceeding,\n\nincluding the imposition or modification of sentence. Thus, a trial court is not permitted\n\nto impose a sentence in its sentencing entry that it did not also impose at the sentencing\n\nhearing. State v. Lantz, 6th Dist. Fulton No. F-18-011, 2019-Ohio-3307, \u00b6 8; State v.\n\nVaughn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103330, 2016-Ohio-3320, \u00b6 18.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} In this case, the trial court technically complied with the requirements of\n\nR.C. 2929.18(A)(1) by ordering Eames to pay restitution in open court, ordering\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93 in case 2, and ordering restitution of \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case\n\n1. However, the court ultimately imposed a different, higher amount of restitution in the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fsentencing entry for case 1, and nothing in the record indicates that the trial court altered\n\nthe restitution amount in Eames\u2019s presence. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s\n\nrestitution order \u201ccomports with all mandatory sentencing provisions[,]\u201d so it is not\n\n\u201cauthorized by law,\u201d as required to bar an appeal under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Underwood\n\nat paragraph two of the syllabus. Accordingly, the state\u2019s argument is unavailing, and we\n\ncan consider the merits of Eames\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n                         2. The trial court\u2019s error was harmless.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Turning to the merits of Eames\u2019s arguments, we find no errors in the\n\nrestitution order in case 2. The court ordered $3,061.93 in restitution for case 2 at the\n\nsentencing hearing and included the same amount in its sentencing judgment entry.\n\nEames does not raise any arguments that this was somehow improper, other than\n\nsummarily saying that the trial court\u2019s announcement of a lower restitution amount in\n\ncase 1 in open court \u201cvoid[ed] both\u201d restitution orders. This argument is not persuasive.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} In case 1, however, the trial court erred by imposing a different restitution\n\namount in the judgment entry than it did at the sentencing hearing, but the error was\n\nharmless. The right to be present that is protected by Crim.R. 43(A) implicates a\n\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights, but only to the extent that the defendant would be denied\n\na fair and just hearing if he were absent. State v. Jones, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-18-\n\n036, 2019-Ohio-2646, \u00b6 6, citing State v. Wilks, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562,\n\n114 N.E.3d 1092, \u00b6 215. Therefore, a violation of Crim.R. 43(A) is subject to a\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\fharmless-error analysis, and we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment unless the\n\ndefendant demonstrates that he was prejudiced by the imposition of a sentence in the\n\njudgment entry but not at the sentencing hearing. Id.; Lantz at \u00b6 9. Prejudice can exist\n\nwhen the discrepancy between the court\u2019s oral and written pronouncements creates an\n\nunclear sentence or eliminates the defendant\u2019s right to object. Lantz at \u00b6 9. But, when\n\nthe defendant agrees to a specific amount of restitution in a plea agreement, and the court\n\nimposes the agreed amount in its sentencing entry, the defendant cannot show prejudice\n\nbased solely on the court\u2019s failure to order restitution in open court at the sentencing\n\nhearing. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Here, Eames has not shown that he was prejudiced by the discrepancy in\n\nthe amount of restitution ordered at the sentencing hearing and the amount imposed in the\n\ncase 1 sentencing entry. The record shows that Eames was aware of the restitution\n\namount and explicitly agreed to pay it. He signed a plea agreement in case 1 in which he\n\nagreed to pay a total of $5,247.62 in restitution, jointly and severally with his\n\ncodefendant, to the victims in that case. This amount was incorporated into the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s ILC plan, and Eames signed copies of the terms and conditions of his ILC plan\n\nthat listed aggregate restitution in case 1 of $5,247.62. Eames also acknowledged at the\n\nsentencing hearing that he agreed to pay restitution in both cases. Eames does not argue\n\nthat the higher amount in the sentencing entry differs from the amount of restitution he\n\nagreed to pay, is somehow inaccurate, or resulted in any other prejudice. Because Eames\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\fhas not shown that the court\u2019s error in stating the amount of restitution in case 1 at the\n\nsentencing hearing prejudiced him, any error was harmless. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Eames also contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider his\n\nability to pay restitution. A court is generally required to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cpresent\n\nand future ability to pay * * *\u201d before imposing a financial sanction permitted by R.C.\n\n2929.18, including restitution. R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). However, the court is not required to\n\nconsider the defendant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing restitution that the defendant\n\nagreed to as part of a plea agreement. State v. Jordan, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-19-1165,\n\n2021-Ohio-333, \u00b6 8. Moreover, a defendant who \u201cagrees to pay restitution as part of their\n\nplea agreement \u2018waives the issue of whether he or she will be able in the future to pay the\n\namount agreed upon.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Coburn, 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-09-006,\n\n2010-Ohio-692, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} As already noted, Eames agreed to pay specific restitution amounts in each\n\ncase as part of his plea agreements. He cannot now claim that the trial court erred by\n\nfailing to consider his ability to pay the agreed-upon amounts because a defendant who\n\n\u201cagrees to pay restitution in a plea agreement cannot challenge, on appeal, the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to consider his or her ability to pay before imposing restitution * * *.\u201d Id.\n\nat \u00b6 10.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} Eames\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f                                     III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 23} For the foregoing reasons, the April 14, 2023 judgments of the Wood\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas are affirmed. Eames is ordered to pay the costs of this\n\nappeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\n                                                                      Judgments affirmed.\n\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.\nSee also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.\n\n\n\nThomas J.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\f                                 I. Background and Facts\n\n       {\u00b6 2} Eames was indicted in two separate cases on a total of 33 charges. In case\n\nNo. 2022CR0045 (\u201ccase 1\u201d), Eames was charged with one count of grand theft in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(4), a third-degree felony; seven counts of petty\n\ntheft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree misdemeanor;\n\nseven counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a fifth-degree\n\nfelony; and ten counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a fifth-\n\ndegree felony. In case No. 2022CR0046 (\u201ccase 2\u201d), Eames was charged with two counts\n\nof petty theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), each a first-degree\n\nmisdemeanor; three counts of identity fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2), each a\n\nfifth-degree felony; and three counts of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and\n\n(B)(2), each a fifth-degree felony.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Eames and the state reached an agreement under which Eames agreed to\n\nplead guilty to 32 of the original charges and pay restitution, and the state agreed to\n\ndismiss the grand theft charge and not oppose Eames\u2019s request for intervention in lieu of\n\nconviction (\u201cILC\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In August 2022, Eames pleaded guilty in both cases. As part of his pleas,\n\nEames agreed to pay 16 of his 23 victims a total of $8,309.55 in restitution, jointly and\n\nseverally with his codefendant. In case 1, he agreed to pay $5,247.62 to 12 victims; in\n\ncase 2, he agreed to pay $3,061.93 to four victims. The trial court accepted Eames\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\fpleas, found that Eames was eligible for ILC and willing to comply with the conditions of\n\nan intervention plan, placed him under the supervision of the probation department for\n\none year, stayed all criminal proceedings against him, and imposed conditions of\n\nsupervision. Among the conditions of his intervention plans were requirements that he\n\npay total restitution of $5,247.62 in case 1 and $3,061.93 in case 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In April 2023, following two ILC violations that Eames stipulated to, the\n\ntrial court terminated Eames\u2019s ILC. At the hearing, after considering Eames\u2019s behavior\n\nwhile on ILC, along with the principles and purposes of sentencing and the applicable\n\nseriousness and recidivism factors, the court terminated Eames\u2019s term of ILC and found\n\nhim guilty of the 32 charges he pleaded to in August 2022. In case 1, the court imposed\n\nprison terms of six months on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and\n\nten months on each identity fraud count. In case 2, the court imposed prison terms of six\n\nmonths on each petty theft count, ten months on each theft count, and ten months on each\n\nidentity fraud count. The court ordered all of the sentences to run concurrently, for an\n\naggregate sentence of ten months. The court also ordered Eames to pay restitution of\n\n$3,061.93 in case 2 and \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case 1.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} The trial court\u2019s sentencing entries generally reflected its actions at the\n\nsentencing hearing. However, in the entry for case 1, the trial court ordered Eames to pay\n\n$5,247.62 in restitution. This is the amount in the plea agreement and judgment entry\n\ngranting Eames\u2019s request for ILC, but is not \u201cthe same amount\u201d as case 2, as the court\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fordered at the sentencing hearing. The entry for case 2 included an order to pay\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Eames now appeals, raising two assignments of error:\n\n              I. The trial court abused its discretion in sentencing Appellant to a\n\n       prison term which was not supported by the record which is an abuse of\n\n       discretion and plain error.\n\n              II. The trial court erred when it ordered the payment of restitution.\n\n                                     II. Law and Analysis\n\nA. We cannot review the trial court\u2019s application of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and\n                                     2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion and committed plain error by sentencing him to ten months in prison because\n\n\u201cthe record does not support the severity of the sentence imposed[,]\u201d which shows that\n\nthe court did not properly consider the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. In response,\n\nthe state points out that we are precluded by State v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">163 Ohio St.3d 242</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2020-\n\nOhio-6729, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">169 N.E.3d 649</span><pre class=\"inline\">, from reviewing the trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C.\n\n2929.11 and 2929.12.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Generally, we review sentencing challenges under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). The\n\nstatute allows us to increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence or vacate the\n\nsentence and remand the matter for resentencing only if we clearly and convincingly find\n\neither (1) the record does not support the trial court\u2019s findings under specified Revised\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fCode sections not at issue here, or (2) the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(a)-(b). Notably, under the statute, \u201c[t]he appellate court\u2019s standard for\n\nreview is not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n\n       {\u00b6 10} However, since the Ohio Supreme Court decided Jones, the law governing\n\nappellate review of a trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 in imposing\n\nsentence is clear: \u201cR.C. 2953.08(G)(2) does not permit an \u2018appellate court to\n\nindependently weigh the evidence in the record and substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrial court concerning the sentence that best reflects compliance with R.C. 2929.11 and\n\n2929.12.\u2019\u201d State v. Bowles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021-Ohio-4401</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181 N.E.3d. 1226, \u00b6 7 (6th Dist.), quoting\n\nJones at \u00b6 42; see also, e.g., State v.

Moreover, we may summarily dispose of an assignment of error that is based only on\n\nthe trial court\u2019s consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. See Bowles at\n\n\u00b6 8, citing State v.

Accordingly, based on the authority of Jones and Toles, we summarily find that\n\nEames\u2019s first assignment of error in not well-taken. Bowles at \u00b6 9, citing Toles at \u00b6 11\n\n(Brunner, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\f       B. The restitution amounts in the sentencing entries are not reversible.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} In his second assignment of error, Eames argues that the trial court erred\n\nwhen it ordered him to pay restitution because the amount of restitution that it ordered at\n\nthe sentencing hearing was not the same as the amount it put in the sentencing entries,\n\nand the court did not consider his ability to pay restitution.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The state responds that Eames is barred by R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) from\n\nappealing the restitution order because he stipulated to the amount of restitution when he\n\npleaded guilty and the amount of restitution was included in the plea agreement that he\n\nsigned. It contends that a trial court is not required to state the amount of stipulated\n\nrestitution in open court for the order to be valid, and the court put the correct amounts in\n\nits sentencing entries, which is what matters. It also argues that the trial court is not\n\nrequired to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution when the defendant agrees to\n\nthe amount of restitution.\n\n               1. We can consider the merits of this assignment of error.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} First, we address the state\u2019s argument that Eames\u2019s appeal is precluded by\n\nR.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Our general ability to review a felony sentence is eliminated when\n\nthe defendant and prosecutor jointly recommend a sentence, the sentencing judge\n\nimposes the recommended sentence, and the sentence is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d R.C.\n\n2953.08(D)(1). \u201cA sentence is \u2018authorized by law\u2019 and is not appealable within the\n\nmeaning of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) only if it comports with all mandatory sentencing\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fprovisions.\u201d State v.

Under R.C. 2929.18(A), a sentencing court\u2019s decision to\n\norder restitution is discretionary. State v.

But, if the court chooses to impose that sanction, R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1) contains mandatory provisions that the court must follow. State v. Brant,\n\n6th Dist. Huron No. H-15-013, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4022225\"><a href=\"/opinion/4244964/state-v-brant/\">2016-Ohio-5274</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 18, citing State v.

Among those mandatory provisions are ordering\n\nrestitution in open court and determining the amount of restitution at sentencing. R.C.\n\n2929.18(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Additionally, although not specifically related to restitution, Crim.R.\n\n43(A)(1) requires a defendant to be physically present (unless appropriate arrangements\n\nare made for the defendant to appear by video) at every stage of a criminal proceeding,\n\nincluding the imposition or modification of sentence. Thus, a trial court is not permitted\n\nto impose a sentence in its sentencing entry that it did not also impose at the sentencing\n\nhearing. State v. Lantz, 6th Dist. Fulton No. F-18-011, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4426229\"><a href=\"/opinion/4648976/state-v-lantz/\">2019-Ohio-3307</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 8; State v.\n\nVaughn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103330, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3211526\"><a href=\"/opinion/3211632/state-v-vaughn/\">2016-Ohio-3320</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 18.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} In this case, the trial court technically complied with the requirements of\n\nR.C. 2929.18(A)(1) by ordering Eames to pay restitution in open court, ordering\n\nrestitution of $3,061.93 in case 2, and ordering restitution of \u201cthe same amount\u201d in case\n\n1. However, the court ultimately imposed a different, higher amount of restitution in the\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\fsentencing entry for case 1, and nothing in the record indicates that the trial court altered\n\nthe restitution amount in Eames\u2019s presence. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s\n\nrestitution order \u201ccomports with all mandatory sentencing provisions[,]\u201d so it is not\n\n\u201cauthorized by law,\u201d as required to bar an appeal under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Underwood\n\nat paragraph two of the syllabus. Accordingly, the state\u2019s argument is unavailing, and we\n\ncan consider the merits of Eames\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n                         2. The trial court\u2019s error was harmless.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Turning to the merits of Eames\u2019s arguments, we find no errors in the\n\nrestitution order in case 2. The court ordered $3,061.93 in restitution for case 2 at the\n\nsentencing hearing and included the same amount in its sentencing judgment entry.\n\nEames does not raise any arguments that this was somehow improper, other than\n\nsummarily saying that the trial court\u2019s announcement of a lower restitution amount in\n\ncase 1 in open court \u201cvoid[ed] both\u201d restitution orders. This argument is not persuasive.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} In case 1, however, the trial court erred by imposing a different restitution\n\namount in the judgment entry than it did at the sentencing hearing, but the error was\n\nharmless. The right to be present that is protected by Crim.R. 43(A) implicates a\n\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights, but only to the extent that the defendant would be denied\n\na fair and just hearing if he were absent.

Therefore, a violation of Crim.R. 43(A) is subject to a\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\fharmless-error analysis, and we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment unless the\n\ndefendant demonstrates that he was prejudiced by the imposition of a sentence in the\n\njudgment entry but not at the sentencing hearing. Id.; Lantz at \u00b6 9. Prejudice can exist\n\nwhen the discrepancy between the court\u2019s oral and written pronouncements creates an\n\nunclear sentence or eliminates the defendant\u2019s right to object. Lantz at \u00b6 9. But, when\n\nthe defendant agrees to a specific amount of restitution in a plea agreement, and the court\n\nimposes the agreed amount in its sentencing entry, the defendant cannot show prejudice\n\nbased solely on the court\u2019s failure to order restitution in open court at the sentencing\n\nhearing. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Here, Eames has not shown that he was prejudiced by the discrepancy in\n\nthe amount of restitution ordered at the sentencing hearing and the amount imposed in the\n\ncase 1 sentencing entry. The record shows that Eames was aware of the restitution\n\namount and explicitly agreed to pay it. He signed a plea agreement in case 1 in which he\n\nagreed to pay a total of $5,247.62 in restitution, jointly and severally with his\n\ncodefendant, to the victims in that case. This amount was incorporated into the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s ILC plan, and Eames signed copies of the terms and conditions of his ILC plan\n\nthat listed aggregate restitution in case 1 of $5,247.62. Eames also acknowledged at the\n\nsentencing hearing that he agreed to pay restitution in both cases. Eames does not argue\n\nthat the higher amount in the sentencing entry differs from the amount of restitution he\n\nagreed to pay, is somehow inaccurate, or resulted in any other prejudice. Because Eames\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\fhas not shown that the court\u2019s error in stating the amount of restitution in case 1 at the\n\nsentencing hearing prejudiced him, any error was harmless. Jones at \u00b6 8.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Eames also contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider his\n\nability to pay restitution. A court is generally required to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cpresent\n\nand future ability to pay * * *\u201d before imposing a financial sanction permitted by R.C.\n\n2929.18, including restitution. R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). However, the court is not required to\n\nconsider the defendant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing restitution that the defendant\n\nagreed to as part of a plea agreement.

Moreover, a defendant who \u201cagrees to pay restitution as part of their\n\nplea agreement \u2018waives the issue of whether he or she will be able in the future to pay the\n\namount agreed upon.\u2019\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4657838\"><a href=\"/opinion/4854059/state-v-jordan/\">Id.,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> quoting State v.

He cannot now claim that the trial court erred by\n\nfailing to consider his ability to pay the agreed-upon amounts because a defendant who\n\n\u201cagrees to pay restitution in a plea agreement cannot challenge, on appeal, the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to consider his or her ability to pay before imposing restitution * * *.\u201d Id.\n\nat \u00b6 10.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} Eames\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f                                     III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 23} For the foregoing reasons, the April 14, 2023 judgments of the Wood\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas are affirmed.

Because any errors in the indictment are not prejudicial and Petitto\u2019s\n\nconvictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of\n\fthe evidence, they are affirmed. The trial court\u2019s erroneous imposition of postrelease\n\ncontrol requires a limited remand.\n\n                            I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} On April 1, 2021, the Ottawa County Grand Jury indicted Petitto on charges\n\nstemming from a high-speed police chase in Ottawa County, Ohio. Relevant to this\n\nappeal, the state secured an indictment against Petitto charging her with two counts of\n\nfelonious assault, R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), as follows:\n\n              Count One Felonious Assault -F1, \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n              The jurors of the Grand Jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the\n\n       body of Ottawa County, on their oaths, IN THE NAME AND BY THE\n\n       AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF OHIO, do find and present:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F1.\n\n              FURTHERMORE, the victim of the offense was a peace officer.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n              Count Two Felonious Assault-F2 \u00a72903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\f              The grand jurors, on their oaths, further find and present that:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F2.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At Petitto\u2019s April 5, 2021 arraignment, the trial court found her indigent and\n\nappointed her counsel; Petitto then waived a reading of the applicable law and penalties\n\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. On April 15, 2021, Petitto\u2019s retained counsel\n\nentered an appearance prompting the withdrawal of appointed counsel. On June 9, 2021,\n\nretained counsel requested leave to withdraw citing Petitto\u2019s lack of cooperation. Petitto\n\nretained a third attorney.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} On February 8, 2022, Petitto changed her plea to not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. Following a competency hearing, the\n\ntrial court found Petitto competent to stand trial. Petitto subsequently made oral request\n\nfor an indigency determination and appointed counsel. On June 30, 2022, Petitto was\n\nagain appointed counsel.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\f       {\u00b6 5} At the December 2 and 22, 2022 bench trial, Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s\n\nSergeant Brandon Amory testified that on March 13, 2021, at approximately 1:41 p.m.,\n\nhe was on road patrol in a marked vehicle and observed Petitto eastbound on S.R. 2 in a\n\nvehicle with no discernable license plate. Amory activated his overhead lights and siren\n\nto initiate a traffic stop. Petitto sped away leading Amory on a high-speed chase.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} Travelling over 90 m.p.h., Petitto exited S.R. 2 at the S.R. 53 south off-\n\nramp. Her vehicle \u201clurched\u201d sharply to the right, up on two wheels, and came back\n\nacross into Amory\u2019s lane of travel striking the front and driver\u2019s side of his vehicle and\n\npushing both vehicles against the guardrail. Sergeant Amory testified that Petitto\n\n\u201ccontinued to rev her engine at that point in time and was lurching forward, inching,\n\nstretching forward.\u201d Amory put his vehicle in reverse to disengage but Petitto\n\n\u201caccelerated\u201d and \u201csmashed\u201d into the passenger side of his vehicle. Amory stated that\n\nthe impact was \u201cdefinitely a jolt\u201d but that the airbags did not deploy. He admitted that\n\nthe maneuver was not necessarily directed at hitting him and that it could have been that\n\nshe was trying to disengage and flee. Amory radioed an injury accident.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Petitto continued northbound on S.R. 53 towards the city of Port Clinton.\n\nSergeant Amory stated that initially his patrol vehicle failed to accelerate due to the crash\n\nbut that his pursuit resumed after the engine \u201ckicked in.\u201d Disregarding all traffic signals\n\nand driving in excess of 90 m.p.h., Petitto entered the Port Clinton city limits. She\n\nnavigated a sharp curve at 60-65 m.p.h. and turned left, or northbound, at Harrison and\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fFremont Streets. The chase ended following a collision between Petitto and a vehicle\n\ndriven by S.R., incapacitating both vehicles.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Sergeant Amory radioed a second injury accident. He ordered Petitto out of\n\nthe vehicle and handcuffed her. He testified:\n\n               At that point in time I kind of collapsed backwards for a second\n\n       because I had gotten jolted back there at the intersection. But my\n\n       adrenaline was kicking, too, and I kind of gathered myself. I ended up\n\n       getting up at that point in time.\n\n               ***\n\n               [T]he jolt had pushed me into my printer, my printer is on my\n\n       console in the center for printing citations. * * * I had taken that jolt and it\n\n       jolted into the side of me. That was part of the pain into the rib area. And\n\n       at that point in time, I kind of collapsed. A lady who was an EMT came up.\n\n       Asked me if I\u2019m okay. I said, I\u2019m fine. Go check on the other victim,\n\n       basically.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Amory\u2019s collapse was captured by the body cam video. He admitted that he\n\nwas medically cleared for service without any time off and that he did not take any\n\nmedications.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Sergeant Amory\u2019s pursuit of Petitto spanned seven to eight miles with a\n\nmaximum speed of 104 m.p.h. He stated that he did not activate his body cam until after\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\fthe initial collisions. The balance of the pursuit and arrest were recorded and played for\n\nthe court. Also played and admitted into evidence was surveillance video from a nearby\n\nbusiness capturing the collision involving S.R. Photographs depicting the crash sites and\n\ndamage to the vehicles were admitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Mentis responded to the second\n\ncrash site. Reviewing the crash photographs, Mentis testified regarding his observations\n\nof the damage to the vehicles involved. He authored the second crash report which was\n\nadmitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Trooper Mentis took Petitto\u2019s and S.R.\u2019s statements which were admitted\n\ninto evidence. In her statement, Petitto admitted that during the incident she failed to\n\nobey all traffic signals and was not distracted by anything during the incident.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The driver involved in the second crash, S.R., and her husband, T.R.,\n\ntestified. S.R. testified that prior to the crash she had rods and screws lining her back\n\nfrom multiple spine surgeries and a neck surgery to correct scoliosis. Following the\n\naccident she was bedridden for two weeks in excruciating pain and that as of the date of\n\ntrial, she had chronic back pain and was still seeing an oral surgeon for pain management.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} S.R. stated that she saw Petitto\u2019s vehicle approach just before impact and\n\nthought she was going to die. She had no memory of the actual collision. S.R. testified\n\nthat her six-month-old car was totaled and had to be replaced. T.R., S.R.\u2019s husband,\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fstated that the crash impacted S.R.\u2019s mobility and limited her ability to travel. She could\n\nno longer perform any household tasks.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} On January 6, 2023, the trial court filed its verdict finding Petitto guilty of\n\nCounts 1-6 and dismissing Count 7 at the state\u2019s request. At Petitto\u2019s February 24, 2023\n\nsentencing hearing, the court noted that Counts 1 and 2, as first and second-degree\n\nfelonies, were subject to indefinite sentencing under R.C. 2929.144, and that Counts 3-5\n\nmerged. The state elected to proceed on Count 5.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} The court stated it considered the sentencing factors under R.C. 2929.11\n\nand 2929.12. As to Count 1, felonious assault of a peace officer, the court sentenced\n\nPetitto to a prison term of 8 to 12 years; on Count 2, felonious assault, 8 years of\n\nimprisonment, to be served concurrently with Count 1. On Count 5, failure to comply\n\nwith the order of a police officer, Petitto was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment to\n\nbe served consecutively to the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 for a total of 11 to 15 years of\n\nimprisonment. Petitto was fined $30 for the seatbelt violation, Count 6.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} The court then gave Petitto the following postrelease control notification:\n\n\u201cYou will be required to serve a mandatory five-year term of post-release control\n\nfollowing your release from prison.\u201d The February 24, 2023 sentencing judgment entry\n\nsimilarly stated: \u201cThe Court explained the concepts of post release control and advised\n\nthat the Defendant would be subject to a mandatory period of five (5) years of post\n\nrelease control upon release from prison.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\f     {\u00b6 18} This appeal followed.\n\n                              II. Assignments of Error\n\n     {\u00b6 19} Petitto raises five assignments of error for review:\n\n            Assignment of Error I: Counts One and Two of the indictment\n\n     against Appellant were defective because they failed to track the language\n\n     of R.C. 2903.11 naming Felonious Assault as a criminal offense and as a\n\n     first and second-degree felony, respectively, in violation of Appellant\u2019s\n\n     right to Due Process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\n     United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution, and Appellant\u2019s right to indictment under Article I, Section 10\n\n     of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error II: The failure of Appellant\u2019s trial counsel to\n\n     file a Motion to Dismiss with respect to Counts One and Two of the\n\n     Indictment constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of\n\n     Appellant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\n     the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error III: Appellant\u2019s convictions for Felonious\n\n     Assault were not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f              Assignment of Error IV: Appellant\u2019s convictions were against the\n\n       manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n              Assignment of Error V: The trial court\u2019s sentence of Appellant was\n\n       contrary to law for incorrectly stating Appellant\u2019s term of post-release\n\n       control.\n\n                                       III. Discussion\n\n                                    A. The Indictment\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Petitto\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the felonious assault counts,\n\nCounts 1 and 2, in the indictment were defective because they failed to track the statutory\n\nlanguage.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Crim.R. 12(C) provides that \u201c[p]rior to trial, any party may raise by motion\n\nany * * * objection * * * that is capable of determination without the trial of the general\n\nissue. The following must be raised before trial: * * * (2) Defenses and objections based\n\non defects in the indictment[.]\u201d \u201c\u2018By failing to timely object to a defect in an indictment,\n\na defendant waives all but plain error on appeal.

Petitto\n\nacknowledges her failure to raise the alleged defects in the indictment prior to trial limits\n\nher to a plain error review.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\f      {\u00b6 22} Crim.R. 7(B) set forth the requirements of an indictment or information and\n\nrelevantly provides:\n\n             The indictment shall be signed in accordance with Crim.R. 6(C) and\n\n      (F) and contain a statement that the defendant has committed a public\n\n      offense specified in the indictment. * * *. The statement may be made in\n\n      ordinary and concise language without technical averments or allegations\n\n      not essential to be proved. The statement may be in the words of the\n\n      applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge\n\n      an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the\n\n      elements of the offense with which the defendant is charged. It may be\n\n      alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed\n\n      the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more\n\n      specified means.

Error in the numerical designation or omission of the numerical\n\n      designation shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or\n\n      information, or for reversal of a conviction, if the error or omission did not\n\n      prejudicially mislead the defendant.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\f       {\u00b6 23} \u201cThe purposes of an indictment are to give an accused adequate notice of\n\nthe charge, and enable an accused to protect himself or herself from any future\n\nprosecutions for the same incident.\u201d State v.

Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985);\n\nHorner at \u00b6 11.\n\n              \u201cAn indictment meets constitutional requirements if it \u2018first, contains\n\n       the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\n       charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an\n\n       acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\u2019\u201d\n\n       State v. Childs, 88 Ohio St.3d 558, 564-565, 728 N.E.2d 379 (2000),\n\n       quoting Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41\n\n       L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).\n\nState v. Troisi, 169 Ohio St.3d 514, 2022-Ohio-3582, 206 N.E.3d 695, \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} Petitto argues prejudice in the omission of the statutory penalty language in\n\nR.C. 2903.11(D)(1)(a), and the improper inclusion of R.C. 2903.11(B) (felonious assault\n\nwhere an accused engaged in sexual conduct without disclosing the accused\u2019s HIV\n\npositive status). Petitto claims that these errors contravene the Civ.R. 7 requirement that\n\nshe be adequately notified of the charges and what the state intends to prove at trial.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 25} Here, the indictment indicates that Count 1, felonious assault, was in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and that Petitto \u201ccaused or attempted to cause physical\n\nharm\u201d to a peace officer by the use of an automobile and that the count was a first-degree\n\nfelony. Similarly, Count 2 lists felonious assault as a violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)\n\nand specifies that the charge was a second-degree felony. There is no indication that the\n\nabsence of the specific penalty section prejudiced Petitto as the felony degree was\n\nindicated. Further, although the inclusion of the HIV subsection was incorrect, the\n\nindictment specifies that Petitto\u2019s felonious assault charges stemmed from the use of her\n\nautomobile as a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Upon review, Petitto was neither prejudiced nor misled by any error or\n\nomission in the indictment and her first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Petitto relatedly argues in her second assignment of error that trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to raise the defective indictment issue denied her effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. An attorney is constitutionally ineffective where serious errors are made and the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Proof of prejudice requires a showing \u201cthat\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of\n\nthe proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694; State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d\n\n136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 28} Because there is no prejudice as to Petitto\u2019s first assignment of error, it\n\nfollows that Petitto\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the issue. Petitto\u2019s\n\nsecond assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                  B. Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Petitto\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error contend that her felonious\n\nassault convictions are based on insufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence. The arguments are related and will be jointly addressed.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} \u201cInsufficiency and manifest weight are distinct legal theories.\u201d State v.\n\nFenderson, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-21-018, 2022-Ohio-1973, \u00b6 73. \u201cIn reviewing a record\n\nfor sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Jenks, 61\n\nOhio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} In contrast, when reviewing a manifest weight claim,\n\n              \u201c[t]he court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all\n\n       reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines\n\n       whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way\n\n       and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must\n\n       be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\f       new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the\n\n       evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d\n\nId., quoting State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 220,\n\nquoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\n       {\u00b6 32} At issue are Petitto\u2019s felonious assault convictions in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.11(A)(2), which provides that \u201cno person shall knowingly * * * [c]ause or attempt\n\nto cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous\n\nordnance.\u201d Petitto contends that the state failed to present sufficient evidence of the\n\nknowingly, mens rea element, failed to demonstrate physical harm, and failed to prove\n\nthat Petitto\u2019s vehicle was a dangerous weapon or ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} R.C. 2901.22(B) defines the \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state as follows:\n\n              A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is\n\n       aware that the person\u2019s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will\n\n       probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances\n\n       when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When\n\n       knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense,\n\n       such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is\n\n       a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a\n\n       conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\f       {\u00b6 34} To prove Petitto acted knowingly, the state needed to demonstrate that\n\nserious physical harm was a reasonable and probable result of her conduct. State v.\n\nStevens, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-19-1219, 2020-Ohio-6981, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Laney, 6th\n\nDist. Williams No. WM-18-004, 2019-Ohio-2648, \u00b6 19. Petitto\u2019s state of mind, may be\n\n\u201c\u2018inferred from the totality of circumstances surrounding the incident.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting\n\nState v. Rodriquez, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-02-046, 2003-Ohio-3453, \u00b6 36, citing State\n\nv. Booth, 133 Ohio App.3d 555, 562, 729 N.E.2d 406 (10th Dist.1999).\n\n       {\u00b6 35} \u201cWhen a defendant evades police and crashes a vehicle into a police\n\ncruiser, the defendant is usually deemed to have acted knowingly because it is likely that\n\nthe officer would suffer physical harm from the collision.\u201d State v. Wells, 4th Dist.\n\nWashington No. 21CA16, 2022-Ohio-3793, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Taylor, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 90001, 2008-Ohio-3455, \u00b6 68. Wells further relies on cases from the\n\nThird, Ninth, and Tenth Appellate Districts upholding felonious assault convictions\n\nwhere the defendant accelerated and struck or rammed a police vehicle. See State v.\n\nAllsup, 3d Dist. Hardin Nos. 6-10-06, 6-10-07, 2011-Ohio-405; State v. Gibson, 9th Dist.\n\nSummit No. 23881, 2008-Ohio-410; State v. Beatty, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-52,\n\n2008-Ohio-5063.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} Here, as to Sergeant Amory, the evidence demonstrates that Petitto led\n\nAmory on a high-speed chase causing two collisions with his patrol vehicle. Similarly, as\n\nto S.R., Petitto, travelling at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic signals, collided\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\fwith her vehicle. It is reasonable and probable that her actions would physically harm\n\nothers.\n\n          {\u00b6 37} Petitto next argues that insufficient evidence supported a finding that her\n\nvehicle was used as a dangerous weapon when her intent was to evade police, not cause\n\nor attempt to cause physical harm.\n\n          {\u00b6 38} A vehicle can be a deadly weapon, \u201cwhen used in a manner likely to\n\nproduce death or great bodily harm.\u201d State v. Belcher, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-13-1250,\n\nL-13-1252, 2014-Ohio-5596, \u00b6 29, citing State v. Gimenez, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n71190, *7 (Sept. 4, 1997). In determining whether a vehicle was used as a deadly\n\nweapon, \u201c[t]he intent of the user, manner of use, and actions of the user are among the\n\nfactors that must be examined.\u201d Belcher at \u00b6 29, citing Giminez at *7. Intent to cause the\n\nspecific harm is not required. State v. Stevens, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-10-1003, 2010-\n\nOhio-4718, \u00b6 25. See State v. Nastal, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-21-042, 2022-Ohio-970, \u00b6\n\n20.\n\n          {\u00b6 39} Here, Petitto\u2019s actions belie her argument. As previously set forth, Petitto\n\nled Sergeant Amory on a high-speed chase spanning several miles. Following the first\n\ntwo collisions, Petitto continued her flight toward the city limits while disregarding all\n\ntraffic signals. The chase ended only after her vehicle was disabled by the third collision.\n\nViewing the evidence in the state\u2019s favor, the dangerous weapon element was supported\n\nby sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f       {\u00b6 40} Petitto next contends that insufficient evidence supports the serious\n\nphysical harm element as to Sergeant Amory. Petitto argues that Amory suffered only\n\nminor injuries, if any. Physical harm is defined as \u201cany injury, illness, or other\n\nphysiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(3).\n\nPhysical harm \u201crequires some manifestation of harm to the [victim], whether it be in the\n\nform of a visible or objective injury, or in the form of pain.\u201d State v. Jasso, 6th Dist.\n\nFulton No. F-22-001, 2023-Ohio-209, \u00b6 28, quoting State v. Brown, 6th Dist. Lucas No.\n\nL-18-1140, 2020-Ohio-1650, \u00b6 20.\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Sergeant Amory testified that the impact of the collision \u201cwas definitely a\n\njolt.\u201d After the chase ended and the adrenaline rush waned, Amory stated that the pain in\n\nhis side from being shoved into the citation printer in the patrol vehicle console caused\n\nhim to fall to the ground. This testimony was sufficient to demonstrate that Amory\n\nsuffered physical harm. See Jasso at \u00b6 29.\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Construing the evidence most favorably for the state, sufficient evidence\n\nsupports the elements of felonious assault. This includes evidence of intent, that serious\n\nphysical harm was a probable\u2014as opposed to a merely likely\u2014result of Petitto\u2019s\n\nconduct, and that her vehicle was properly categorized as a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\nPetitto\u2019s third assignment of error, therefore, is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Petitto makes near-identical arguments in support of her fourth assignment\n\nof error by arguing that her felonious assault convictions were against the manifest\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fweight of the evidence because the evidence failed to establish the elements of intent,\n\nphysical harm, and the use of a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Reviewing the entire proceeding, the trial court did not lose its way or\n\ncreate a manifest injustice in weighing the evidence or resolving any conflicting\n\nevidence. This includes Amory\u2019s testimony that the collisions with his vehicle may have\n\nbeen the result of Petitto\u2019s attempt to escape, not her intent to hit his patrol vehicle and\n\nhis testimony regarding whether the collisions caused him injury. The trial court was free\n\nto infer that Petitto\u2019s actions, including her high rate of speed and disregard of traffic\n\nsignals, evidenced her intent to cause physical harm and the use of her vehicle as a\n\ndangerous weapon or ordnance. Sergeant Amory testified regarding the jolt caused by\n\nthe collision and the body cam video depicts him falling to the ground from the pain in\n\nhis side. Victim, S.R., testified as to her chronic pain and decreased quality of life\n\nresulting from the accident. Thus, Petitto\u2019s felonious assault convictions were not against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence and her fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                   C. Postrelease Control\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Petitto\u2019s fifth assignment of error is that her sentence is contrary to law due\n\nto the trial court\u2019s failure to properly impose postrelease control. The state has conceded\n\nerror pursuant to 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 10(H)\n\n       {\u00b6 46} \u201c\u2018[S]entencing errors in the imposition of postrelease control render the\n\nsentence voidable, not void, and the sentence may be set aside if successfully challenged\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\fon direct appeal.\u2019\u201d State v. Sprouse, 6th Lucas No. L-22-1230, 2023-Ohio-2983, \u00b6 24,\n\nquoting State v. Harper, 160 Ohio St.3d 480, 2020-Ohio-2913, 159 N.E.3d 248, \u00b6 42.\n\n\u201c\u2018And if a court improperly imposes postrelease control on a sentence imposed on or\n\nafter July 11, 2006, it may correct the sentence in accordance with the procedures set\n\nforth in R.C. 2929.191, which provides that a court must hold a hearing before issuing the\n\ncorrection.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Schleiger, 141 Ohio St.3d 67, 2014-Ohio-3970, 21\n\nN.E.3d 1033, \u00b6 15.\n\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2967.28(B) requires that the court impose mandatory postrelease\n\ncontrol terms based on the degree of felony. It provides:\n\n              [A] period of post-release control required by this division for an\n\n       offender shall be of one of the following periods:\n\n              (1) For a felony sex offense, five years;\n\n              (2) For a felony of the first degree that is not a felony sex offense, up\n\n       to five years, but not less than two years;\n\n              (3) For a felony of the second degree that is not a felony sex offense,\n\n       up to three years, but not less than eighteen months;\n\n              (4) For a felony of the third degree that is an offense of violence and\n\n       is not a felony sex offense, up to three years, but not less than one year.\n\n       {\u00b6 48} Petitto\u2019s felonious assault conviction is a first-degree, non sex offense,\n\nfelony. Thus, R.C. 2967.28(B)(2) applies and requires the imposition of a two-to-five-\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\fyear postrelease control term. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s sentence of Petitto to a\n\n\u201cmandatory\u201d five-year postrelease control term was erroneous. Petitto\u2019s fifth assignment\n\nof error is well-taken.\n\n                                      IV. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 49} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas is affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part. The portion of the judgment\n\nimposing postrelease control is reversed and vacated. The remaining portions of the\n\njudgment are affirmed.

Because any errors in the indictment are not prejudicial and Petitto\u2019s\n\nconvictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of\n\fthe evidence, they are affirmed. The trial court\u2019s erroneous imposition of postrelease\n\ncontrol requires a limited remand.\n\n                            I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} On April 1, 2021, the Ottawa County Grand Jury indicted Petitto on charges\n\nstemming from a high-speed police chase in Ottawa County, Ohio. Relevant to this\n\nappeal, the state secured an indictment against Petitto charging her with two counts of\n\nfelonious assault, R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), as follows:\n\n              Count One Felonious Assault -F1, \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n              The jurors of the Grand Jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the\n\n       body of Ottawa County, on their oaths, IN THE NAME AND BY THE\n\n       AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF OHIO, do find and present:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F1.\n\n              FURTHERMORE, the victim of the offense was a peace officer.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n              Count Two Felonious Assault-F2 \u00a72903.11(A)(2), 2903.11(B)\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\f              The grand jurors, on their oaths, further find and present that:\n\n              Jade L. Petitto, on or about March 13, 2021, at the county of Ottawa\n\n       aforesaid, did knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another\n\n       by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: a motor\n\n       vehicle/automobile in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2),\n\n       2903.11(B), Felonious Assault, F2.\n\n              The offense is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made\n\n       and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} At Petitto\u2019s April 5, 2021 arraignment, the trial court found her indigent and\n\nappointed her counsel; Petitto then waived a reading of the applicable law and penalties\n\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. On April 15, 2021, Petitto\u2019s retained counsel\n\nentered an appearance prompting the withdrawal of appointed counsel. On June 9, 2021,\n\nretained counsel requested leave to withdraw citing Petitto\u2019s lack of cooperation. Petitto\n\nretained a third attorney.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} On February 8, 2022, Petitto changed her plea to not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. Following a competency hearing, the\n\ntrial court found Petitto competent to stand trial. Petitto subsequently made oral request\n\nfor an indigency determination and appointed counsel. On June 30, 2022, Petitto was\n\nagain appointed counsel.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\f       {\u00b6 5} At the December 2 and 22, 2022 bench trial, Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s\n\nSergeant Brandon Amory testified that on March 13, 2021, at approximately 1:41 p.m.,\n\nhe was on road patrol in a marked vehicle and observed Petitto eastbound on S.R. 2 in a\n\nvehicle with no discernable license plate. Amory activated his overhead lights and siren\n\nto initiate a traffic stop. Petitto sped away leading Amory on a high-speed chase.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} Travelling over 90 m.p.h., Petitto exited S.R. 2 at the S.R. 53 south off-\n\nramp. Her vehicle \u201clurched\u201d sharply to the right, up on two wheels, and came back\n\nacross into Amory\u2019s lane of travel striking the front and driver\u2019s side of his vehicle and\n\npushing both vehicles against the guardrail. Sergeant Amory testified that Petitto\n\n\u201ccontinued to rev her engine at that point in time and was lurching forward, inching,\n\nstretching forward.\u201d Amory put his vehicle in reverse to disengage but Petitto\n\n\u201caccelerated\u201d and \u201csmashed\u201d into the passenger side of his vehicle. Amory stated that\n\nthe impact was \u201cdefinitely a jolt\u201d but that the airbags did not deploy. He admitted that\n\nthe maneuver was not necessarily directed at hitting him and that it could have been that\n\nshe was trying to disengage and flee. Amory radioed an injury accident.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} Petitto continued northbound on S.R. 53 towards the city of Port Clinton.\n\nSergeant Amory stated that initially his patrol vehicle failed to accelerate due to the crash\n\nbut that his pursuit resumed after the engine \u201ckicked in.\u201d Disregarding all traffic signals\n\nand driving in excess of 90 m.p.h., Petitto entered the Port Clinton city limits. She\n\nnavigated a sharp curve at 60-65 m.p.h. and turned left, or northbound, at Harrison and\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\fFremont Streets. The chase ended following a collision between Petitto and a vehicle\n\ndriven by S.R., incapacitating both vehicles.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Sergeant Amory radioed a second injury accident. He ordered Petitto out of\n\nthe vehicle and handcuffed her. He testified:\n\n               At that point in time I kind of collapsed backwards for a second\n\n       because I had gotten jolted back there at the intersection. But my\n\n       adrenaline was kicking, too, and I kind of gathered myself. I ended up\n\n       getting up at that point in time.\n\n               ***\n\n               [T]he jolt had pushed me into my printer, my printer is on my\n\n       console in the center for printing citations. * * * I had taken that jolt and it\n\n       jolted into the side of me. That was part of the pain into the rib area. And\n\n       at that point in time, I kind of collapsed. A lady who was an EMT came up.\n\n       Asked me if I\u2019m okay. I said, I\u2019m fine. Go check on the other victim,\n\n       basically.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Amory\u2019s collapse was captured by the body cam video. He admitted that he\n\nwas medically cleared for service without any time off and that he did not take any\n\nmedications.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Sergeant Amory\u2019s pursuit of Petitto spanned seven to eight miles with a\n\nmaximum speed of 104 m.p.h. He stated that he did not activate his body cam until after\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\fthe initial collisions. The balance of the pursuit and arrest were recorded and played for\n\nthe court. Also played and admitted into evidence was surveillance video from a nearby\n\nbusiness capturing the collision involving S.R. Photographs depicting the crash sites and\n\ndamage to the vehicles were admitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Mentis responded to the second\n\ncrash site. Reviewing the crash photographs, Mentis testified regarding his observations\n\nof the damage to the vehicles involved. He authored the second crash report which was\n\nadmitted into evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Trooper Mentis took Petitto\u2019s and S.R.\u2019s statements which were admitted\n\ninto evidence. In her statement, Petitto admitted that during the incident she failed to\n\nobey all traffic signals and was not distracted by anything during the incident.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The driver involved in the second crash, S.R., and her husband, T.R.,\n\ntestified. S.R. testified that prior to the crash she had rods and screws lining her back\n\nfrom multiple spine surgeries and a neck surgery to correct scoliosis. Following the\n\naccident she was bedridden for two weeks in excruciating pain and that as of the date of\n\ntrial, she had chronic back pain and was still seeing an oral surgeon for pain management.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} S.R. stated that she saw Petitto\u2019s vehicle approach just before impact and\n\nthought she was going to die. She had no memory of the actual collision. S.R. testified\n\nthat her six-month-old car was totaled and had to be replaced. T.R., S.R.\u2019s husband,\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\fstated that the crash impacted S.R.\u2019s mobility and limited her ability to travel. She could\n\nno longer perform any household tasks.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} On January 6, 2023, the trial court filed its verdict finding Petitto guilty of\n\nCounts 1-6 and dismissing Count 7 at the state\u2019s request. At Petitto\u2019s February 24, 2023\n\nsentencing hearing, the court noted that Counts 1 and 2, as first and second-degree\n\nfelonies, were subject to indefinite sentencing under R.C. 2929.144, and that Counts 3-5\n\nmerged. The state elected to proceed on Count 5.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} The court stated it considered the sentencing factors under R.C. 2929.11\n\nand 2929.12. As to Count 1, felonious assault of a peace officer, the court sentenced\n\nPetitto to a prison term of 8 to 12 years; on Count 2, felonious assault, 8 years of\n\nimprisonment, to be served concurrently with Count 1. On Count 5, failure to comply\n\nwith the order of a police officer, Petitto was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment to\n\nbe served consecutively to the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 for a total of 11 to 15 years of\n\nimprisonment. Petitto was fined $30 for the seatbelt violation, Count 6.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} The court then gave Petitto the following postrelease control notification:\n\n\u201cYou will be required to serve a mandatory five-year term of post-release control\n\nfollowing your release from prison.\u201d The February 24, 2023 sentencing judgment entry\n\nsimilarly stated: \u201cThe Court explained the concepts of post release control and advised\n\nthat the Defendant would be subject to a mandatory period of five (5) years of post\n\nrelease control upon release from prison.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\f     {\u00b6 18} This appeal followed.\n\n                              II. Assignments of Error\n\n     {\u00b6 19} Petitto raises five assignments of error for review:\n\n            Assignment of Error I: Counts One and Two of the indictment\n\n     against Appellant were defective because they failed to track the language\n\n     of R.C. 2903.11 naming Felonious Assault as a criminal offense and as a\n\n     first and second-degree felony, respectively, in violation of Appellant\u2019s\n\n     right to Due Process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\n     United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution, and Appellant\u2019s right to indictment under Article I, Section 10\n\n     of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error II: The failure of Appellant\u2019s trial counsel to\n\n     file a Motion to Dismiss with respect to Counts One and Two of the\n\n     Indictment constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of\n\n     Appellant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\n     the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio\n\n     Constitution.\n\n            Assignment of Error III: Appellant\u2019s convictions for Felonious\n\n     Assault were not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\f              Assignment of Error IV: Appellant\u2019s convictions were against the\n\n       manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n              Assignment of Error V: The trial court\u2019s sentence of Appellant was\n\n       contrary to law for incorrectly stating Appellant\u2019s term of post-release\n\n       control.\n\n                                       III. Discussion\n\n                                    A. The Indictment\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Petitto\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the felonious assault counts,\n\nCounts 1 and 2, in the indictment were defective because they failed to track the statutory\n\nlanguage.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Crim.R. 12(C) provides that \u201c[p]rior to trial, any party may raise by motion\n\nany * * * objection * * * that is capable of determination without the trial of the general\n\nissue.

Petitto claims that these errors contravene the Civ.R. 7 requirement that\n\nshe be adequately notified of the charges and what the state intends to prove at trial.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 25} Here, the indictment indicates that Count 1, felonious assault, was in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and that Petitto \u201ccaused or attempted to cause physical\n\nharm\u201d to a peace officer by the use of an automobile and that the count was a first-degree\n\nfelony. Similarly, Count 2 lists felonious assault as a violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)\n\nand specifies that the charge was a second-degree felony. There is no indication that the\n\nabsence of the specific penalty section prejudiced Petitto as the felony degree was\n\nindicated. Further, although the inclusion of the HIV subsection was incorrect, the\n\nindictment specifies that Petitto\u2019s felonious assault charges stemmed from the use of her\n\nautomobile as a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Upon review, Petitto was neither prejudiced nor misled by any error or\n\nomission in the indictment and her first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Petitto relatedly argues in her second assignment of error that trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to raise the defective indictment issue denied her effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.

As previously set forth, Petitto\n\nled Sergeant Amory on a high-speed chase spanning several miles. Following the first\n\ntwo collisions, Petitto continued her flight toward the city limits while disregarding all\n\ntraffic signals. The chase ended only after her vehicle was disabled by the third collision.\n\nViewing the evidence in the state\u2019s favor, the dangerous weapon element was supported\n\nby sufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\f       {\u00b6 40} Petitto next contends that insufficient evidence supports the serious\n\nphysical harm element as to Sergeant Amory.

This testimony was sufficient to demonstrate that Amory\n\nsuffered physical harm. See Jasso at \u00b6 29.\n\n       {\u00b6 42} Construing the evidence most favorably for the state, sufficient evidence\n\nsupports the elements of felonious assault. This includes evidence of intent, that serious\n\nphysical harm was a probable\u2014as opposed to a merely likely\u2014result of Petitto\u2019s\n\nconduct, and that her vehicle was properly categorized as a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\nPetitto\u2019s third assignment of error, therefore, is not well-taken.\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Petitto makes near-identical arguments in support of her fourth assignment\n\nof error by arguing that her felonious assault convictions were against the manifest\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\fweight of the evidence because the evidence failed to establish the elements of intent,\n\nphysical harm, and the use of a deadly weapon or ordnance.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Reviewing the entire proceeding, the trial court did not lose its way or\n\ncreate a manifest injustice in weighing the evidence or resolving any conflicting\n\nevidence. This includes Amory\u2019s testimony that the collisions with his vehicle may have\n\nbeen the result of Petitto\u2019s attempt to escape, not her intent to hit his patrol vehicle and\n\nhis testimony regarding whether the collisions caused him injury. The trial court was free\n\nto infer that Petitto\u2019s actions, including her high rate of speed and disregard of traffic\n\nsignals, evidenced her intent to cause physical harm and the use of her vehicle as a\n\ndangerous weapon or ordnance. Sergeant Amory testified regarding the jolt caused by\n\nthe collision and the body cam video depicts him falling to the ground from the pain in\n\nhis side. Victim, S.R., testified as to her chronic pain and decreased quality of life\n\nresulting from the accident. Thus, Petitto\u2019s felonious assault convictions were not against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence and her fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                   C. Postrelease Control\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Petitto\u2019s fifth assignment of error is that her sentence is contrary to law due\n\nto the trial court\u2019s failure to properly impose postrelease control.

The\n\nOfficer determined the car was not stolen, but Defendant was driving on a revoked\n\nlicense. The Officer returned to Defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him \u201cabout the odor\n\nof marijuana in the vehicle.\u201d    Defendant denied smoking marijuana in the car,\n\nprompting the following exchange:\n\n         Officer: You didn\u2019t have a blunt earlier or anything?\n\n         Defendant: No. I just got the car from my homeboy.

After the search and finding no weapons, the Officer\n\nreturned Defendant\u2019s cellphone and cigarettes, but opened and searched the Crown\n\nRoyal bag.

On 17 August 2022, Defendant filed a\n\nMotion to Suppress the evidence from the Crown Royal bag, arguing the Officer\n\nlacked probable cause to search the car, and consequently, lacked probable cause to\n\nsearch the bag.\n\n      Specifically, at the hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress on 23 August\n\n2022, Defendant contended that because hemp, which Defendant argued is\n\nindistinguishable from marijuana in odor and appearance, is legal in North Carolina,\n\nthe odor of marijuana alone was no longer sufficient to establish probable cause for\n\nthe ensuing searches. The State argued that binding precedent in this state holds\n\nthat marijuana odor alone per se supports a finding of probable cause to support a\n\nsearch. Further, the State asserted even presuming odor alone was insufficient, the\n\nOfficer had additional evidence supporting probable cause, including Defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201cfidgety\u201d behavior, the fact Defendant was driving with a fictitious tag and without a\n\nvalid license, and Defendant\u2019s agreement marijuana may have been smoked in the\n\ncar earlier, which the trial court characterized as \u201can acknowledgment, if not an\n\nadmission\u201d marijuana had been smoked in the car.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court orally granted Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion. In rendering its ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cSo I think that the standards\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                       STATE V.

There was no probable cause.\u201d\n\n          The State filed written Notice of Appeal on 29 August 2022. The Notice of\n\nAppeal, however, stated the appeal was from an order \u201cgrant[ing] the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss[.]\u201d        Two days later, on 31 August 2022, the State filed a\n\nCertification, certifying that the appeal was not taken for the purpose of delay and\n\nthat the evidence suppressed is essential to the case.\n\n                                   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n          The parties do not address appellate jurisdiction in their briefing to this Court.\n\nHowever, the State\u2019s Notice of Appeal, the later Certification of its interlocutory\n\nappeal, failure to include a Statement of Grounds for Appellate Review in its brief,\n\n\n1 State v.

See State v. Webber, 190 N.C. App. 649, 650, 660 S.E.2d 621, 622 (2008)\n\n(\u201cIt is well-established that the issue of a court\u2019s jurisdiction over a matter may be\n\nraised at any time, even . . . by a court sua sponte.\u201d).\n\n      First, \u201cwhen a [party] has not properly given notice of appeal, this Court is\n\nwithout jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d State v.

See N.C.R. App. P.\n\n4 (2023). Relevant to this case, Rule 4(b) provides the requisite contents of a written\n\nnotice of appeal:\n\n          The notice of appeal required to be filed and served . . . shall\n          specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the\n          judgment or order from which appeal is taken and the court to\n          which appeal is taken; and shall be signed by counsel of record for\n          the party or parties taking the appeal, or by any such party not\n          represented by counsel of record.\n\nN.C.R. App. P 4(b) (emphasis added).           \u201cOur Supreme Court has said that a\n\njurisdictional default, such as a failure to comply with Rule 4, \u2018precludes the appellate\n\ncourt from acting in any manner other than to dismiss the appeal.\u2019 \u201d            State v.\n\nHammonds, 218 N.C.

Rather, the\n\nState\u2019s arguments focus entirely on the grant of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress. We\n\nacknowledge, however, \u201c \u2018a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not result\n\nin loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be\n\nfairly inferred from the notice and the appeal is not misled by the mistake[.]\u2019 \u201d\n\nStephenson v.

App. 153, 156-57, 392 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1990)).\n\n      Our Court has observed that granting a motion to suppress\u2014even of evidence\n\nwhich is essential to the State\u2019s case\u2014is not synonymous with dismissal of the case.\n\nSee State v.

App. 701, 706, 649\n\nS.E.2d 646, 650 (2007))).\n\n      Indeed, this highlights a second jurisdictional issue: the State\u2019s appeal is from\n\nan interlocutory order. See Romano, 268 N.C. App. at 445, 836 S.E.2d at 767 (an\n\norder granting a motion to suppress is an interlocutory\u2014not final\u2014decision). N.C.\n\nGen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) provides the State a statutory right of appeal from an Order\n\ndenying a motion to suppress prior to trial \u201cupon certificate by the prosecutor to the\n\njudge who granted the motion that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay\n\nand that the evidence is essential to the case.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) (2021).\n\nThis Court has recognized Section 15A-979(c) \u201cnot only requires the State to raise its\n\nright to appeal according to the statutory mandate, but also places the burden on the\n\nState to demonstrate that it had done so.\u201d State v. Dobson, 51 N.C. App. 445, 447,\n\n276 S.E.2d 480, 482 (1981).      Similarly, Rule 28(b)(4) of the Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure requires: \u201cAn appellant\u2019s brief shall contain . . . [a] statement of the\n\ngrounds for appellate review. Such statement shall include citation of the statute or\n\nstatutes permitting appellate review.\u201d N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(4) (2023).\n\n      Crucially, \u201cwhen an appeal is interlocutory, Rule 28(b)(4) is not a\n\n\u2018nonjurisdictional\u2019 rule. Rather, the only way an appellant may establish appellate\n\njurisdiction in an interlocutory case . . . is by showing grounds for appellate review[.]\u201d\n\nLarsen v. Black Diamond French Truffles, Inc., 241 N.C. App. 74, 77-78, 772 S.E.2d\n\n93, 96 (2015) (emphasis in original); see also Coates v. Durham Cnty., 266 N.C.

This burden rests solely with the appellant. Jeffreys v. Raleigh Oaks\n\nJoint Venture, 115 N.C. App. 377, 379, 444 S.E.2d 252, 253 (1994).\n\n      Here, in violation of N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(4), the State wholly failed to include\n\nany statement of grounds for appellate review. The State\u2019s brief offers no discussion\n\nof its defective Notice of Appeal or the timeliness of its subsequently filed\n\nCertification of the appeal. Nowhere in briefing does the State cite to N.C. Gen. Stat.\n\n\u00a7 15A-979 as statutory support for its interlocutory appeal. Moreover, the State\u2019s\n\nappeal is from an orally rendered Order granting a Motion to Dismiss without written\n\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law. The State, however, offers no basis or rationale\n\nfor our ability to review the orally rendered Order in this circumstance. The State\u2019s\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure combined with its\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 28(b)(4) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure constitutes a\n\njurisdictional defect in the appeal depriving this Court of appellate jurisdiction\n\nrequiring dismissal of the appeal.\n\n      Nevertheless, even assuming the shortcomings in the State\u2019s appeal and\n\nbriefing do not rise to the level of jurisdictional defects, they still constitute\n\nsubstantial violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure impairing and frustrating\n\nthis Court\u2019s ability to review the merits. See Dogwood, 362 N.C. at 201, 657 S.E.2d\n\nat 367.    Here, the defects in the appeal\u2014at a minimum\u2014raise substantial\n\n                                            -8-\n\f                                      STATE V.

This not only hampers our ability to judicially review this matter efficiently\n\nand effectively but also frustrates the appellate adversarial process by not squarely\n\nraising these issues to be briefed or addressed by Defendant. The State has also not\n\ntaken steps to recognize or remedy these defects, such as petitioning for certiorari.\n\n       Mindful of the admonishment \u201cit is not the role of this Court to create an appeal\n\nfor an appellant or to supplement an appellant\u2019s brief with legal authority or\n\narguments not contained therein[,]\u201d Thompson v. Bass, 261 N.C. App. 285, 292, 819\n\nS.E.2d 621, 627 (2018), we conclude the State\u2019s violations of the appellate rules are\n\nsubstantial enough to potentially warrant dismissal of its interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Thus, the State\u2019s violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure constitute\n\neither jurisdictional defects in the appeal mandating dismissal or substantial non-\n\njurisdictional violations of the appellate rules justifying dismissal of the appeal on\n\nthe basis that the State has failed to demonstrate appellate jurisdiction in this Court.\n\nTherefore, the State\u2014as the appellant\u2014has failed to meet its burden of establishing\n\nappellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Nevertheless, under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-32(c), \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals has\n\njurisdiction . . . to issue the prerogative writs, including . . . certiorari . . . in aid of its\n\nown jurisdiction[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-32(c) (2021). The decision to issue a writ is\n\ngoverned by statute and by common law. See State v. Killette, 381 N.C. 686, 691, 873\n\nS.E.2d 317, 320 (2022).        \u201cOur precedent establishes a two-factor test to assess\n\n                                              -9-\n\f                                   STATE V.

First, a writ of\n\ncertiorari should issue only if the petitioner can show \u2018merit or that error was\n\nprobably committed below.\u2019 \u201d Cryan v. Nat\u2019l Council of YMCA of the United States,\n\n384 N.C. 569, 572, 887 S.E.2d 848, 851 (2023). Second, a writ of certiorari should\n\nonly issue if there are extraordinary circumstances to justify it. Moore v. Moody, 304\n\nN.C. 719, 720, 285 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1982). \u201cThere is no fixed list of \u2018extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\u2019 that warrant certiorari review, but this factor generally requires a\n\nshowing of substantial harm, considerable waste of judicial resources, or \u2018wide-\n\nreaching issues of justice and liberty at stake.\u2019 \u201d Cryan, 384 N.C. at 573, 887 S.E.2d\n\nat 851 (quoting Doe v.

App. 10, 23, 848 S.E.2d 1, 11 (2020)).\n\n      Here, despite its defects, we conclude the State\u2019s appeal raises sufficient merit\n\nto consider issuance of the writ of certiorari. Moreover, given the posture of the case,\n\njudicial economy and efficient use of judicial resources weighs in favor of exercising\n\nour discretion to issue the writ of certiorari pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-32(c).\n\nHowever, given the substantial and gross violations of the Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure, we tax the costs of this appeal to the State as a sanction pursuant to\n\nN.C.R.

The SBI memo explains that industrial hemp is\n\na variety of the same species of plant as marijuana, but it contains lower levels of\n\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical in marijuana.\n\nAccording to the SBI memo, the legalization hemp poses significant issues for law\n\nenforcement because \u201c[t]here is no easy way for law enforcement to distinguish\n\nbetween industrial hemp and marijuana\u201d and there is no way for law enforcement to\n\nquickly test and determine whether a substance is hemp or marijuana.            Thus,\n\nDefendant contended\u2014and the trial court agreed\u2014the odor of marijuana in this case\n\ndetected by the Officer did not itself give rise to probable cause to conduct the\n\nwarrantless search\u2014in particular\u2014of the Crown Royal bag on Defendant\u2019s person.\n\n      In this case, however, as in Parker, the Officer had several reasons in addition\n\nto the odor of marijuana to support probable cause to search the vehicle and,\n\nconsequently, the Crown Royal bag. As such, again, \u201cwe need not determine whether\n\nthe scent or visual identification of marijuana alone remains sufficient to grant an\n\nofficer probable cause to search a vehicle.\u201d Id.\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                        STATE V.

Defendant made no\n\nassertion at the time the odor derived from legalized hemp. See id. at 541-42, 860\n\nS.E.2d at 29 (finding probable cause where a police officer smelled marijuana, the\n\ndefendant admitted to smoking marijuana earlier, and the defendant produced a\n\npartially smoked marijuana cigarette from his person). Further, Defendant was\n\ndriving a car with a fictitious tag, which the Officer had observed, and which\n\nprompted this stop. Cf. State v. Murray, 192 N.C. App. 684, 688-89, 666 S.E.2d 205,\n\n208 (2008) (finding a police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to support a traffic\n\nstop where the vehicle was obeying all traffic laws, and a check of the license plate\n\nshowed no irregularities).        Additionally, Defendant was driving with an invalid\n\nlicense, which the Officer confirmed prior to the search. See State v. Duncan, 287\n\nN.C. App. 467, 473-76, 883 S.E.2d 210, 214-16 (2023) (finding probable cause for a\n\nwarrantless arrest where law enforcement learned from a license plate check that\n\ndefendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was medically cancelled).2\n\nAdditionally, the Officer had probable cause to search both the vehicle itself and the\n\nCrown Royal bag. \u201cIf probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle,\n\n\n2 There was also testimony\u2014although disputed\u2014Defendant appeared nervous to the Officer because\n\nhis hands were \u201cshaking\u201d and he was \u201cfumbling through some paperwork\u201d when the Officer\napproached the vehicle. See State v. Corpening, 109 N.C. App. 586, 589-90, 427 S.E.2d 892, 895 (1993)\n(noting that a defendant\u2019s nervous behavior supported probable cause to search his vehicle). In\nrendering its Order, the trial court did not address this evidence. This underscores the utility of a\nwritten order in these circumstances including specific findings of fact and conclusions of law when\nallowing a motion to suppress.\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f                                   STATE V.

App. at 175, 735 S.E.2d at 441 (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 347, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1721 (2009)\n\n(holding probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity\n\n\u201cauthorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.\u201d\n\n(citation omitted)). This Court in Armstrong upheld the search of a vehicle\u2019s glove\n\ncompartment even after defendants were handcuffed and secured in a police patrol\n\nvehicle, which resulted in the discovery of cocaine. 236 N.C. App. at 133, 762 S.E.2d\n\nat 644. There, this Court found that the officers involved had probable cause to search\n\nthe vehicle based on the odor of marijuana emanating from it. Id. at 132-33, 762\n\nS.E.2d at 643-44. The present case is analogous.\n\n      As discussed supra, the Officer had probable cause to search the vehicle based\n\non the odor of marijuana and additional suspicious circumstances. On that basis, the\n\nOfficer had probable cause to search the vehicle \u201cand its contents\u201d for evidence.\n\nMitchell, 224 N.C. App. at 175, 735 S.E.2d at 441. The Crown Royal bag, as one of\n\nthe contents of the vehicle, was thus subject to the Officer\u2019s search. The fact that\n\nDefendant attempted to remove the Crown Royal bag is immaterial because the bag\n\nwas in the car at the time of the stop. See State v. Massenburg, 66 N.C. App. 127,\n\n130, 310 S.E.2d 619, 622 (1984) (\u201cThe scope of the search is not defined by the nature\n\nof the container in which the contraband is secreted but is defined by the object of the\n\nsearch and the places in which there is probable cause to believe it may be found.\u201d)\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\f                                   STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nHere, the object of the Officer\u2019s search was evidence of marijuana, which it was\n\nreasonable to believe could have been in the Crown Royal bag. Therefore, because\n\nthe Officer had probable cause to search the vehicle, he also had probable cause to\n\nsearch the Crown Royal bag.\n\n      Thus, the Officer was aware of several suspicious circumstances\u2014including\n\nthe odor of marijuana\u2014at the time of the search. Therefore, under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the Officer had probable cause to search the Crown Royal bag.\n\nConsequently, the trial court erred in granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress the\n\nevidence that resulted from the search.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s grant of Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion to Suppress is reversed, and this case is remanded for additional proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, due to the substantial violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n\nthe costs of this appeal are taxed to the State.\n\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n      Judge GRIFFIN concurs.\n\n      Judge MURPHY concurs in part and dissents in part by separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\f No. COA23-9 \u2013 State v.

Nat\u2019l Council of YMCAs of the U.S., 384\n             N.C. 569, 573 (2023) (quoting State v. Ricks, 378 N.C. 737,\n             741 (2021))]. \u201cIf courts issued writs of certiorari solely on\n             the showing of some error below, it would \u2018render\n             meaningless the rules governing the time and manner of\n             noticing appeals.\u2019\u201d Id. at 573 (quoting Ricks, 378 N.C. at\n             741). An extraordinary circumstance \u201cgenerally requires a\n             showing of substantial harm, considerable waste of judicial\n             resources, or \u2018wide-reaching issues of justice and liberty at\n             stake.\u2019\u201d Id. at 573 (quoting Doe v. City of Charlotte, 273\n             N.C. App. 10, 23 (2020)).\n\n             Here, Defendant argues the trial court erred, but\n             Defendant fails to explain why this case involves an\n             extraordinary circumstance sufficient to excuse his failure\n             to preserve his right to appeal. Notably, Defendant fails to\n             mention the word \u201cextraordinary\u201d in his PWC. Defendant\n             merely concludes that the \u201cinterests of justice thus require\u201d\n             us to grant a writ of certiorari. Defendant\u2019s argument falls\n             far short of our extraordinary-circumstance standard, and\n             further, our review of the record reveals no extraordinary\n             circumstances. See id. at 573. Therefore, we deny\n             Defendant\u2019s PWC and dismiss his appeal for lack of\n             jurisdiction. See [State v.

The\n\nOfficer determined the car was not stolen, but Defendant was driving on a revoked\n\nlicense. The Officer returned to Defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him \u201cabout the odor\n\nof marijuana in the vehicle.\u201d    Defendant denied smoking marijuana in the car,\n\nprompting the following exchange:\n\n         Officer: You didn\u2019t have a blunt earlier or anything?\n\n         Defendant: No. I just got the car from my homeboy.

Defendant did so and took\n\nsome belongings with him, including a cellphone, cigarettes, and a Crown Royal bag.\n\nThe Officer took Defendant\u2019s items and put them in the driver\u2019s seat of the car to pat\n\ndown Defendant for weapons. After the search and finding no weapons, the Officer\n\nreturned Defendant\u2019s cellphone and cigarettes, but opened and searched the Crown\n\nRoyal bag. In the bag, the Officer found a digital scale, a green leafy substance, two\n\nbaggies of white powder, and \u201cnumerous baggies of colorful pills[.]\u201d\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                  STATE V.

On 17 August 2022, Defendant filed a\n\nMotion to Suppress the evidence from the Crown Royal bag, arguing the Officer\n\nlacked probable cause to search the car, and consequently, lacked probable cause to\n\nsearch the bag.\n\n      Specifically, at the hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress on 23 August\n\n2022, Defendant contended that because hemp, which Defendant argued is\n\nindistinguishable from marijuana in odor and appearance, is legal in North Carolina,\n\nthe odor of marijuana alone was no longer sufficient to establish probable cause for\n\nthe ensuing searches. The State argued that binding precedent in this state holds\n\nthat marijuana odor alone per se supports a finding of probable cause to support a\n\nsearch. Further, the State asserted even presuming odor alone was insufficient, the\n\nOfficer had additional evidence supporting probable cause, including Defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201cfidgety\u201d behavior, the fact Defendant was driving with a fictitious tag and without a\n\nvalid license, and Defendant\u2019s agreement marijuana may have been smoked in the\n\ncar earlier, which the trial court characterized as \u201can acknowledgment, if not an\n\nadmission\u201d marijuana had been smoked in the car.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court orally granted Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion. In rendering its ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cSo I think that the standards\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                       STATE V.

There was no probable cause.\u201d\n\n          The State filed written Notice of Appeal on 29 August 2022. The Notice of\n\nAppeal, however, stated the appeal was from an order \u201cgrant[ing] the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss[.]\u201d        Two days later, on 31 August 2022, the State filed a\n\nCertification, certifying that the appeal was not taken for the purpose of delay and\n\nthat the evidence suppressed is essential to the case.\n\n                                   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n          The parties do not address appellate jurisdiction in their briefing to this Court.\n\nHowever, the State\u2019s Notice of Appeal, the later Certification of its interlocutory\n\nappeal, failure to include a Statement of Grounds for Appellate Review in its brief,\n\n\n1 State v.

App. at 541, 860 S.E.2d at 29.\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\f                                  STATE V. SPRINGS\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nThis Court went on, however, to determine \u201cin the case before us today we need not\n\ndetermine whether the scent or visual identification of marijuana alone remains\n\nsufficient to grant an officer probable cause to search a vehicle.\u201d Id. This was so\n\nbecause we determined there were additional circumstances that supported probable\n\ncause for a warrantless search in that case beyond the odor of marijuana. Id.\n\n      As in Parker, Defendant here also relied on a memorandum published by the\n\nState Bureau of Investigation (SBI). The SBI memo explains that industrial hemp is\n\na variety of the same species of plant as marijuana, but it contains lower levels of\n\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical in marijuana.\n\nAccording to the SBI memo, the legalization hemp poses significant issues for law\n\nenforcement because \u201c[t]here is no easy way for law enforcement to distinguish\n\nbetween industrial hemp and marijuana\u201d and there is no way for law enforcement to\n\nquickly test and determine whether a substance is hemp or marijuana.            Thus,\n\nDefendant contended\u2014and the trial court agreed\u2014the odor of marijuana in this case\n\ndetected by the Officer did not itself give rise to probable cause to conduct the\n\nwarrantless search\u2014in particular\u2014of the Crown Royal bag on Defendant\u2019s person.\n\n      In this case, however, as in Parker, the Officer had several reasons in addition\n\nto the odor of marijuana to support probable cause to search the vehicle and,\n\nconsequently, the Crown Royal bag. As such, again, \u201cwe need not determine whether\n\nthe scent or visual identification of marijuana alone remains sufficient to grant an\n\nofficer probable cause to search a vehicle.\u201d Id.\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                        STATE V.

Defendant made no\n\nassertion at the time the odor derived from legalized hemp. See id. at 541-42, 860\n\nS.E.2d at 29 (finding probable cause where a police officer smelled marijuana, the\n\ndefendant admitted to smoking marijuana earlier, and the defendant produced a\n\npartially smoked marijuana cigarette from his person). Further, Defendant was\n\ndriving a car with a fictitious tag, which the Officer had observed, and which\n\nprompted this stop. Cf. State v.

Therefore, because\n\nthe Officer had probable cause to search the vehicle, he also had probable cause to\n\nsearch the Crown Royal bag.\n\n      Thus, the Officer was aware of several suspicious circumstances\u2014including\n\nthe odor of marijuana\u2014at the time of the search. Therefore, under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the Officer had probable cause to search the Crown Royal bag.\n\nConsequently, the trial court erred in granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress the\n\nevidence that resulted from the search.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s grant of Defendant\u2019s\n\nMotion to Suppress is reversed, and this case is remanded for additional proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, due to the substantial violations of the Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n\nthe costs of this appeal are taxed to the State.\n\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n      Judge GRIFFIN concurs.\n\n      Judge MURPHY concurs in part and dissents in part by separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\f No. COA23-9 \u2013 State v.

(2007) 40 Cal.4th 529.)\nAfter considering defendant\u2019s supplemental brief, we conclude there are no arguable\nissues that would result in a more favorable outcome to defendant and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n       In March 2021, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. SCCR-CRF-\n2021-320-1 with assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); statutory\nsection citations that follow are found in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated);\nexhibiting a deadly weapon to a peace officer with the intent to resist and prevent arrest\nand detention (\u00a7 417.8); and resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer (\u00a7 148,\nsubd. (a)(1)). The complaint alleged a prior 2013 Massachusetts conviction for assault to\ncommit murder with a knife as a prior serious felony (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)) and a prior\nstrike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (b)-(i), 1170.12).\n       In May 2021, the trial court declared a doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency\npursuant to section 1368 and suspended criminal proceedings. Defendant appealed the\ncourt\u2019s order, and in case No. C094429 this court dismissed the appeal after finding the\norder nonappealable.\n       In July 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s Marsden (People v. Marsden\n(1970) 2 Cal. 3d 118) motion. Defendant appealed in case No. C094612; this court\ndismissed the appeal after concluding defendant appealed from a nonappealable order.\n       In September 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to be heard on a\nmotion to suppress given that criminal proceedings remained suspended.\n       In October 2021, the trial court found defendant incompetent to stand trial.\nDefendant appealed in case No. C095200, and, after examining the notice of appeal, this\ncourt dismissed the appeal as premature.\n       In November 2021, the trial court committed defendant to Napa State Hospital for\ntreatment for no more than two years. At that time, the court found defendant had the\ncapacity to accept or refuse medication. Defendant appealed the order in case No.\nC095417. Because defendant was later restored to competency and the matter was\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fresolved by plea, this court dismissed the appeal from the court\u2019s November commitment\norder.\n         After some initial delay, by June 2022, defendant had been transported to Napa\nState Hospital. During a medication review hearing in July 2022, an administrative law\njudge found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant lacked the capacity to make\ndecisions regarding antipsychotic medication, that his mental disorder required treatment\nwith antipsychotic medication, and without such treatment it was probable that serious\nphysical or mental harm would result. The administrative law judge ordered that the\nhospital could involuntarily medicate defendant until August 16, 2022, but that any\ninvoluntary medication beyond that date required a court order.\n         In an August 4, 2022, report under section 1370, subdivision (b)(1), a forensic\npsychologist opined that defendant was not yet competent to stand trial and should be\nretained for further treatment; defendant repeatedly declined to be interviewed.\nAccording to the report, defendant met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders \u2013 Fifth Edition (DSM V) criteria for having unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder. He suffered from a history of delusions and\nparanoid ideation. The role of substance abuse in exacerbating defendant\u2019s symptoms\nwas unclear. He admitted regularly using cannabis, alcohol, and ecstasy for extended\nperiods of time since his youth, and stated he had experimented with cocaine and\nVicodin, but denied using Ayahuasca and became guarded in his response. More\ninformation was needed to diagnose him with a substance use disorder.\n         The report detailed previous evaluations, which found defendant repeatedly denied\nhaving any mental health issues and concluded that he did not appear to have the capacity\nto discuss the alleged offenses in a rational or coherent manner; his ongoing psychotic\nprocesses continued to impair defendant\u2019s ability to engage in a reality-based, organized,\nmeaningful discussion about his legal case and decisional considerations. Defendant\u2019s\nnumerous writings to the court exhibited persecutory delusions, including that he had\n\n                                              3\n\fbeen targeted by a white supremacist military and Christian cartel, that he believed the\njudge falsely imprisoned him based on his refusal to interview, and that the public\ndefenders were colluding to keep him locked up, and grandiose delusions, including that\nhe is an \u201cindependent regulator of Ayahuasca temples in the U.S., and is exempt from\nfollowing the law.\u201d\n       The Department of State Hospitals subsequently petitioned the court for an\ninvoluntary antipsychotic medication order under section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(D)(iv).\nThe petition similarly alleged that defendant required the administration of antipsychotic\nmedication because he lacked the capacity to make medication decisions, his mental\ndisorder required medical treatment with antipsychotic medication, and without such\ntreatment serious harm to defendant\u2019s mental or physical health was probable.\n       At the hearing on the petition, Dr. Ahmed, a Napa State Hospital psychiatrist who\nhad worked with defendant for about six weeks and had treated defendant with\nantipsychotic medication for approximately 10 days to two weeks following the\nadministrative law judge\u2019s temporary order, testified defendant was currently diagnosed\nas schizophrenic with an unspecified psychosis disorder. Defendant\u2019s symptoms\nincluded paranoid ideation; he believed that the judge and his attorney had conspired\nagainst him, and he refused to be evaluated for treatment or engage in therapy sessions.\nHe also refused to meet with an assigned social worker with the name \u201cChristian.\u201d\n       Dr. Ahmed had assessed approximately 500 patients for involuntary medication\norders over the past seven years. He opined that defendant was not aware of his\npsychiatric illness, and that he was unable to evaluate the benefits and risks of taking\nantipsychotic medication. Defendant lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions, and, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, there were no other treatment options\navailable to treat paranoia.\n       At a continued hearing on August 18, 2022, Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant\u2019s\nparanoia impacted his mental health by causing him to isolate and not engage in any\n\n                                              4\n\ftreatment or evaluations, or to utilize any mental competency material. Defendant\nexposed himself to other patients that were more severely mentally ill, which concerned\nDr. Ahmed because defendant seemed unable to stop himself which could lead to\ndangerous situations. Defendant distrusted his treatment team, the nurses, and refused to\ncommunicate with a staff member named Christian. In Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, defendant\nwould refuse to take the needed medication unless court ordered.\n       Treating defendant with antipsychotic medication, according to Dr. Ahmed, would\nreduce his mental health symptoms, improve his insight and judgment, and allow him to\nregain competency; without treatment, defendant\u2019s symptoms would continue to worsen.\nMedication would also improve defendant\u2019s daily living and his interactions with his\npeers and treatment staff.\n       Defendant was currently being treated with a small dose of antipsychotic\nmedication, and although Dr. Ahmed had not seen a huge improvement, defendant was\nable to better tolerate longer conversations. It generally took about 90 days to reach\ntherapeutic levels that helped alleviate mental health symptoms.\n       Because the medicine could have adverse side effects such as constipation,\nstomach pains, and weight gain, patients were routinely monitored to manage potential\neffects. While defendant claimed the medication caused high blood pressure, Dr. Ahmed\ntestified that defendant\u2019s blood pressure was normal and would be monitored.\n       Defendant allegedly objected to being involuntarily medicated based on religious\ngrounds. Dr. Ahmed, however, testified that defendant had never told him that the reason\nhe did not want to take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever\ntalked to Dr. Ahmed about his religious beliefs.\n       Defendant testified on his own behalf. He had been sadhu, or a self-appointed\nmonk, since 2005, which is why he isolated from others. He studies Kabbalah literature.\nHe testified that his objection to taking medication was because he could only be\ndependent on \u201cthe deity.\u201d\n\n                                             5\n\f       When asked whether his exercise of free religion included not having mind-\naltering substances, defendant responded, \u201cno.\u201d He explained that he already used\npsychotropic substances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the\n\u201cgodhead\u201d or \u201csuper soul,\u201d the \u201chigher deity.\u201d The drugs that defendant took worked like\npeyote, expanding defendant\u2019s mind and \u201cinvad[ing] [his] free will.\u201d\n       Defendant had been taking the oral antipsychotic medication after the temporary\norder because he did not want to be forcibly injected. He believed the medication was\nharming his short-term memory and killing his brain cells. According to defendant, he\nwas not required to participate in therapy, and he was not incompetent. Defendant denied\nhaving schizophrenia.\n       During closing remarks, defense counsel argued the People failed to satisfy the\nSell (Sell v. United States (2003) 539 U.S. 166) factors for involuntarily medicating a\ndefendant for the purpose of restoring him or her to competency. The court took the\nmatter under submission.\n       The next day, the trial court granted an order authorizing involuntary medication.\nThe court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant\nlacked the capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and if his\nmental disorder was not treated, serious harm to his physical or mental health would\nprobably result.\n       Based on Dr. Ahmed\u2019s testimony, the court found that the purpose of the\nmedication was not only to restore defendant to competency but also to improve his daily\nliving, interactions, and insight, including participation in therapeutic programs. Thus,\nthe court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument based on Sell. In any event, even if the\nonly reason for the medication was to restore competency, the court found the People had\nmet their burden of satisfying the Sell factors, including that (1) defendant was charged\nwith a serious crime against a person; (2) involuntary medication of antipsychotic\nmedication was substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial;\n\n                                             6\n\f(3) the medication was unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the defendant\u2019s\nability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the\nconduct of a defense in a reasonable manner; and (4) that less intrusive treatments were\nunlikely to have substantially the same results and antipsychotic medication was in the\npatient\u2019s best interest in light of his medical condition. Defendant timely appealed the\ninvoluntary medication order.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Appointed counsel filed an opening brief setting forth the facts of the case and\nasking this court to review the record and determine whether there are any arguable\nissues on appeal.

Defendant was\nadvised by counsel of the right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days of the date of\nfiling the opening brief.\n       Defendant filed a supplemental brief. As best we can understand, defendant\nclaims he was raised inside of a government-police syndicate or cult that engaged in\nAryan catholic abuse. His first key memory at age five, which was installed by the\nparens patriae syndicate in Simi Valley, locked his brain \u201cto Mikal high priest and to\ngreyskull,\u201d defendant\u2019s name in the \u201cGod-circuit,\u201d and since then, his mind was\npermanently chained to the memory, and consequently, \u201csusceptible to it as an inroad on\nthe security of his mind and his God-circuit, and to create a mind-war cycle in the brain\nthat goes on and on, an intended eventual schism of the brain\u2014crossed [third] eye, to\nmake a caduceus, all-seeing eye, occult doctrine.\u201d He alleges that a government project\nknown as \u201c \u2018project stargate\u2019 \u201d makes \u201cpuppet-ziggurats, including with Ayahuasca\nwhich was introduced to [defendant] in 2005 by the syndicate, and is engaged nationally\nin a \u2018mind-war\u2019 \u201d somehow involving defendant\u2019s religion \u201ccult of Santo Daime\u201d and the\n\u201c \u2018God Shiva.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       As best we can discern, defendant\u2019s supplemental brief raises numerous issues that\nare not cognizable in this appeal from the involuntary medication order, and we do not\naddress them. Such matters include issues related to the following: a 2009 criminal\nprosecution in Massachusetts and a previous schizophrenia diagnosis in that case; alleged\nInternal Revenue Service claims of charity fraud against two Ayahuasca-based charities\nin Oregon and what defendant characterizes as \u201cfederal government stalking\u201d; a\ndiscontinuation of \u201cPUA funds\u201d and ordered repayment of funds previously disbursed;\nthe propriety of an alleged warrantless search under the Fourth Amendment and being\nlocked out of three consecutive locations in Mount Shasta; an attack by armed persons on\nhis campsite in February 2021; whether the state willfully prosecuted defendant under a\ndifferent name other than his monk\u2019s moniker and correct name \u201cSiva de Simon\nGreyskull Black\u201d; violation of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery\nand involuntary servitude; whether state actors or governmental departments exercised a\ngovernment-orthodoxy religion; and the validity of his plea.\n       Furthermore, to the extent defendant failed to appeal from the underlying\njudgment following his plea, defendant \u201ccannot now be permitted to make a direct attack\nupon his convictions\u201d or the plea. (People v. Webb (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 410; see\nalso \u00a7 1237, subd. (a) [an appealable judgment is generally rendered at the time of\nsentencing]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.308(a) [a notice of appeal must be filed within 60\ndays after the judgment or order being appealed to confer appellate jurisdiction].) Thus,\nissues that could have been raised in an appeal from the judgment on his criminal\nconvictions, but which were not because defendant failed to timely appeal, are also not at\nissue in defendant\u2019s present appeal.\n       Turning to the involuntary medication order on appeal, defendant argues the order\nis void because it violated his religious beliefs. We disagree.\n       The United States Constitution and California Constitution prohibit involuntary\nmedication that burdens a patient\u2019s free exercise of religion, unless a compelling state\n\n                                             8\n\finterest outweighs the patient\u2019s interests in religious freedom. (U.S. Const., 1st Amd. &\n14th Amd.; Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 4; People v. Woody (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716, 718; State\nDept. of State Hospitals v. A.H. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 441, 446-447 (A.H.).) We review\nthe court\u2019s order for substantial evidence. (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 701;\nPeople v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314.)\n       Defendant bore the burden of showing that; (1) he sought to engage in the exercise\nof religion and (2) that the involuntary psychotropic medication order substantially\nburdened the exercise of his religion. (A.H., supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at pp. 445-446.)\nHere, there is no credible evidence that defendant\u2019s objection to the involuntary\nmedication order was based on a sincerely held religious belief or substantially burdened\ndefendant\u2019s exercise of his religion.\n       Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant never told him that the reason he did not want\nto take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever talked to Dr.\nAhmed about his religious beliefs. When asked whether his religious beliefs precluded\nhim from taking mind-altering substances like antipsychotic medication, defendant\nreplied that they did not. Instead, he testified that he already used psychotropic\nsubstances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the \u201cgodhead.\u201d Based on\nDr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s\nimplied finding that defendant could still practice his religion while simultaneously\ntaking antipsychotic medication, even if the medication was a different psychotropic\nsubstance than the one he readily admitted ingesting as part of his religion.\n       To the extent defendant contends the trial court made the involuntary medication\norder to punish him for not participating in mental health evaluations at Napa State\nHospital, essentially resulting in slavery, or that the judge simply wanted to \u201cwear [his]\nspirit\u201d like he was \u201ca god,\u201d nothing in the record supports such speculation. Dr. Ahmed,\nwho had assessed nearly 500 patients for involuntary medication orders over a seven-year\nperiod, testified that defendant suffered from schizophrenia and an unspecified psychotic\n\n                                              9\n\fdisorder, which resulted in significant delusions and paranoia that led defendant to act in\ndangerous ways. Dr. Ahmed explained that the only treatment for defendant\u2019s diagnosed\nmental illness, which defendant refused to acknowledge, was antipsychotic medication,\nand in the absence of such medication, defendant\u2019s symptoms would worsen over time.\nDefendant, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions.\n       In granting the involuntary medication order, the trial court carefully considered\nthe case files and the moving papers as well as Dr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony at\nthe hearing on the petition. After weighing the benefits and risks of taking the currently\nprescribed Zyprexa (Olanzapine), the court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision\n(a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant lacked the capacity to make decisions regarding\nantipsychotic medication, that his diagnosed mental disorder required treatment with such\nmedication, and if his mental condition was left untreated, it was probable that serious\nharm to defendant\u2019s mental health would result. On this record, we cannot conclude the\ncourt erred in so finding.\n       Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that sections 1369 and 1370\nunconstitutionally violate his right to defend himself or to a speedy trial. The claim is\nforfeited because defendant did not raise these specific objections below. (See e.g.,\nPeople v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 691 [defendant forfeited his claim that\nprosecutor\u2019s actions constituted an improper attempt to interfere with defendant\u2019s ability\nto exercise his constitutional right to \u2018compulsory process\u2019 by failing to raise a claim of\ncompulsory process violation in the trial court].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n     The order permitting involuntary antipsychotic medication is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              HULL, Acting P.

Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); statutory\nsection citations that follow are found in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated);\nexhibiting a deadly weapon to a peace officer with the intent to resist and prevent arrest\nand detention (\u00a7 417.8); and resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer (\u00a7 148,\nsubd. (a)(1)). The complaint alleged a prior 2013 Massachusetts conviction for assault to\ncommit murder with a knife as a prior serious felony (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)) and a prior\nstrike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (b)-(i), 1170.12).\n       In May 2021, the trial court declared a doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency\npursuant to section 1368 and suspended criminal proceedings. Defendant appealed the\ncourt\u2019s order, and in case No. C094429 this court dismissed the appeal after finding the\norder nonappealable.\n       In July 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s Marsden (People v. Marsden\n(1970) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal. 3d 118</span><pre class=\"inline\">) motion. Defendant appealed in case No. C094612; this court\ndismissed the appeal after concluding defendant appealed from a nonappealable order.\n       In September 2021, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to be heard on a\nmotion to suppress given that criminal proceedings remained suspended.\n       In October 2021, the trial court found defendant incompetent to stand trial.\nDefendant appealed in case No. C095200, and, after examining the notice of appeal, this\ncourt dismissed the appeal as premature.\n       In November 2021, the trial court committed defendant to Napa State Hospital for\ntreatment for no more than two years. At that time, the court found defendant had the\ncapacity to accept or refuse medication. Defendant appealed the order in case No.\nC095417. Because defendant was later restored to competency and the matter was\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fresolved by plea, this court dismissed the appeal from the court\u2019s November commitment\norder.\n         After some initial delay, by June 2022, defendant had been transported to Napa\nState Hospital. During a medication review hearing in July 2022, an administrative law\njudge found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant lacked the capacity to make\ndecisions regarding antipsychotic medication, that his mental disorder required treatment\nwith antipsychotic medication, and without such treatment it was probable that serious\nphysical or mental harm would result. The administrative law judge ordered that the\nhospital could involuntarily medicate defendant until August 16, 2022, but that any\ninvoluntary medication beyond that date required a court order.\n         In an August 4, 2022, report under section 1370, subdivision (b)(1), a forensic\npsychologist opined that defendant was not yet competent to stand trial and should be\nretained for further treatment; defendant repeatedly declined to be interviewed.\nAccording to the report, defendant met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders \u2013 Fifth Edition (DSM V) criteria for having unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder. He suffered from a history of delusions and\nparanoid ideation. The role of substance abuse in exacerbating defendant\u2019s symptoms\nwas unclear. He admitted regularly using cannabis, alcohol, and ecstasy for extended\nperiods of time since his youth, and stated he had experimented with cocaine and\nVicodin, but denied using Ayahuasca and became guarded in his response. More\ninformation was needed to diagnose him with a substance use disorder.\n         The report detailed previous evaluations, which found defendant repeatedly denied\nhaving any mental health issues and concluded that he did not appear to have the capacity\nto discuss the alleged offenses in a rational or coherent manner; his ongoing psychotic\nprocesses continued to impair defendant\u2019s ability to engage in a reality-based, organized,\nmeaningful discussion about his legal case and decisional considerations. Defendant\u2019s\nnumerous writings to the court exhibited persecutory delusions, including that he had\n\n                                              3\n\fbeen targeted by a white supremacist military and Christian cartel, that he believed the\njudge falsely imprisoned him based on his refusal to interview, and that the public\ndefenders were colluding to keep him locked up, and grandiose delusions, including that\nhe is an \u201cindependent regulator of Ayahuasca temples in the U.S., and is exempt from\nfollowing the law.\u201d\n       The Department of State Hospitals subsequently petitioned the court for an\ninvoluntary antipsychotic medication order under section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(D)(iv).\nThe petition similarly alleged that defendant required the administration of antipsychotic\nmedication because he lacked the capacity to make medication decisions, his mental\ndisorder required medical treatment with antipsychotic medication, and without such\ntreatment serious harm to defendant\u2019s mental or physical health was probable.\n       At the hearing on the petition, Dr. Ahmed, a Napa State Hospital psychiatrist who\nhad worked with defendant for about six weeks and had treated defendant with\nantipsychotic medication for approximately 10 days to two weeks following the\nadministrative law judge\u2019s temporary order, testified defendant was currently diagnosed\nas schizophrenic with an unspecified psychosis disorder. Defendant\u2019s symptoms\nincluded paranoid ideation; he believed that the judge and his attorney had conspired\nagainst him, and he refused to be evaluated for treatment or engage in therapy sessions.\nHe also refused to meet with an assigned social worker with the name \u201cChristian.\u201d\n       Dr. Ahmed had assessed approximately 500 patients for involuntary medication\norders over the past seven years. He opined that defendant was not aware of his\npsychiatric illness, and that he was unable to evaluate the benefits and risks of taking\nantipsychotic medication. Defendant lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions, and, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, there were no other treatment options\navailable to treat paranoia.\n       At a continued hearing on August 18, 2022, Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant\u2019s\nparanoia impacted his mental health by causing him to isolate and not engage in any\n\n                                              4\n\ftreatment or evaluations, or to utilize any mental competency material. Defendant\nexposed himself to other patients that were more severely mentally ill, which concerned\nDr. Ahmed because defendant seemed unable to stop himself which could lead to\ndangerous situations. Defendant distrusted his treatment team, the nurses, and refused to\ncommunicate with a staff member named Christian. In Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, defendant\nwould refuse to take the needed medication unless court ordered.\n       Treating defendant with antipsychotic medication, according to Dr. Ahmed, would\nreduce his mental health symptoms, improve his insight and judgment, and allow him to\nregain competency; without treatment, defendant\u2019s symptoms would continue to worsen.\nMedication would also improve defendant\u2019s daily living and his interactions with his\npeers and treatment staff.\n       Defendant was currently being treated with a small dose of antipsychotic\nmedication, and although Dr. Ahmed had not seen a huge improvement, defendant was\nable to better tolerate longer conversations. It generally took about 90 days to reach\ntherapeutic levels that helped alleviate mental health symptoms.\n       Because the medicine could have adverse side effects such as constipation,\nstomach pains, and weight gain, patients were routinely monitored to manage potential\neffects. While defendant claimed the medication caused high blood pressure, Dr. Ahmed\ntestified that defendant\u2019s blood pressure was normal and would be monitored.\n       Defendant allegedly objected to being involuntarily medicated based on religious\ngrounds. Dr. Ahmed, however, testified that defendant had never told him that the reason\nhe did not want to take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever\ntalked to Dr. Ahmed about his religious beliefs.\n       Defendant testified on his own behalf. He had been sadhu, or a self-appointed\nmonk, since 2005, which is why he isolated from others. He studies Kabbalah literature.\nHe testified that his objection to taking medication was because he could only be\ndependent on \u201cthe deity.\u201d\n\n                                             5\n\f       When asked whether his exercise of free religion included not having mind-\naltering substances, defendant responded, \u201cno.\u201d He explained that he already used\npsychotropic substances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the\n\u201cgodhead\u201d or \u201csuper soul,\u201d the \u201chigher deity.\u201d The drugs that defendant took worked like\npeyote, expanding defendant\u2019s mind and \u201cinvad[ing] [his] free will.\u201d\n       Defendant had been taking the oral antipsychotic medication after the temporary\norder because he did not want to be forcibly injected. He believed the medication was\nharming his short-term memory and killing his brain cells. According to defendant, he\nwas not required to participate in therapy, and he was not incompetent. Defendant denied\nhaving schizophrenia.\n       During closing remarks, defense counsel argued the People failed to satisfy the\nSell (Sell v. United States (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130152\"><a href=\"/opinion/130152/sell-v-united-states/\">539 U.S. 166</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) factors for involuntarily medicating a\ndefendant for the purpose of restoring him or her to competency. The court took the\nmatter under submission.\n       The next day, the trial court granted an order authorizing involuntary medication.\nThe court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant\nlacked the capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and if his\nmental disorder was not treated, serious harm to his physical or mental health would\nprobably result.\n       Based on Dr. Ahmed\u2019s testimony, the court found that the purpose of the\nmedication was not only to restore defendant to competency but also to improve his daily\nliving, interactions, and insight, including participation in therapeutic programs. Thus,\nthe court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument based on Sell. In any event, even if the\nonly reason for the medication was to restore competency, the court found the People had\nmet their burden of satisfying the Sell factors, including that (1) defendant was charged\nwith a serious crime against a person; (2) involuntary medication of antipsychotic\nmedication was substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial;\n\n                                             6\n\f(3) the medication was unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the defendant\u2019s\nability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the\nconduct of a defense in a reasonable manner; and (4) that less intrusive treatments were\nunlikely to have substantially the same results and antipsychotic medication was in the\npatient\u2019s best interest in light of his medical condition. Defendant timely appealed the\ninvoluntary medication order.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Appointed counsel filed an opening brief setting forth the facts of the case and\nasking this court to review the record and determine whether there are any arguable\nissues on appeal. (Conservatorship of Ben C., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">40 Cal.4th 529</span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Defendant was\nadvised by counsel of the right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days of the date of\nfiling the opening brief.\n       Defendant filed a supplemental brief. As best we can understand, defendant\nclaims he was raised inside of a government-police syndicate or cult that engaged in\nAryan catholic abuse. His first key memory at age five, which was installed by the\nparens patriae syndicate in Simi Valley, locked his brain \u201cto Mikal high priest and to\ngreyskull,\u201d defendant\u2019s name in the \u201cGod-circuit,\u201d and since then, his mind was\npermanently chained to the memory, and consequently, \u201csusceptible to it as an inroad on\nthe security of his mind and his God-circuit, and to create a mind-war cycle in the brain\nthat goes on and on, an intended eventual schism of the brain\u2014crossed [third] eye, to\nmake a caduceus, all-seeing eye, occult doctrine.\u201d He alleges that a government project\nknown as \u201c \u2018project stargate\u2019 \u201d makes \u201cpuppet-ziggurats, including with Ayahuasca\nwhich was introduced to [defendant] in 2005 by the syndicate, and is engaged nationally\nin a \u2018mind-war\u2019 \u201d somehow involving defendant\u2019s religion \u201ccult of Santo Daime\u201d and the\n\u201c \u2018God Shiva.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       As best we can discern, defendant\u2019s supplemental brief raises numerous issues that\nare not cognizable in this appeal from the involuntary medication order, and we do not\naddress them. Such matters include issues related to the following: a 2009 criminal\nprosecution in Massachusetts and a previous schizophrenia diagnosis in that case; alleged\nInternal Revenue Service claims of charity fraud against two Ayahuasca-based charities\nin Oregon and what defendant characterizes as \u201cfederal government stalking\u201d; a\ndiscontinuation of \u201cPUA funds\u201d and ordered repayment of funds previously disbursed;\nthe propriety of an alleged warrantless search under the Fourth Amendment and being\nlocked out of three consecutive locations in Mount Shasta; an attack by armed persons on\nhis campsite in February 2021; whether the state willfully prosecuted defendant under a\ndifferent name other than his monk\u2019s moniker and correct name \u201cSiva de Simon\nGreyskull Black\u201d; violation of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery\nand involuntary servitude; whether state actors or governmental departments exercised a\ngovernment-orthodoxy religion; and the validity of his plea.\n       Furthermore, to the extent defendant failed to appeal from the underlying\njudgment following his plea, defendant \u201ccannot now be permitted to make a direct attack\nupon his convictions\u201d or the plea. (People v. Webb (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">186 Cal.App.3d 401</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410; see\nalso \u00a7 1237, subd.

Thus,\nissues that could have been raised in an appeal from the judgment on his criminal\nconvictions, but which were not because defendant failed to timely appeal, are also not at\nissue in defendant\u2019s present appeal.\n       Turning to the involuntary medication order on appeal, defendant argues the order\nis void because it violated his religious beliefs. We disagree.\n       The United States Constitution and California Constitution prohibit involuntary\nmedication that burdens a patient\u2019s free exercise of religion, unless a compelling state\n\n                                             8\n\finterest outweighs the patient\u2019s interests in religious freedom.

(A.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6106849\"><a href=\"/opinion/6239918/cal-dept-of-state-hosps-v-ah/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 27 Cal.App.5th at pp. 445-446.)\nHere, there is no credible evidence that defendant\u2019s objection to the involuntary\nmedication order was based on a sincerely held religious belief or substantially burdened\ndefendant\u2019s exercise of his religion.\n       Dr. Ahmed testified that defendant never told him that the reason he did not want\nto take the medication was based on his religion, nor had defendant ever talked to Dr.\nAhmed about his religious beliefs. When asked whether his religious beliefs precluded\nhim from taking mind-altering substances like antipsychotic medication, defendant\nreplied that they did not. Instead, he testified that he already used psychotropic\nsubstances as part of his religion, which connected his mind to the \u201cgodhead.\u201d Based on\nDr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s\nimplied finding that defendant could still practice his religion while simultaneously\ntaking antipsychotic medication, even if the medication was a different psychotropic\nsubstance than the one he readily admitted ingesting as part of his religion.\n       To the extent defendant contends the trial court made the involuntary medication\norder to punish him for not participating in mental health evaluations at Napa State\nHospital, essentially resulting in slavery, or that the judge simply wanted to \u201cwear [his]\nspirit\u201d like he was \u201ca god,\u201d nothing in the record supports such speculation. Dr. Ahmed,\nwho had assessed nearly 500 patients for involuntary medication orders over a seven-year\nperiod, testified that defendant suffered from schizophrenia and an unspecified psychotic\n\n                                              9\n\fdisorder, which resulted in significant delusions and paranoia that led defendant to act in\ndangerous ways. Dr. Ahmed explained that the only treatment for defendant\u2019s diagnosed\nmental illness, which defendant refused to acknowledge, was antipsychotic medication,\nand in the absence of such medication, defendant\u2019s symptoms would worsen over time.\nDefendant, in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s opinion, lacked the capacity to make antipsychotic\nmedication decisions.\n       In granting the involuntary medication order, the trial court carefully considered\nthe case files and the moving papers as well as Dr. Ahmed\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony at\nthe hearing on the petition. After weighing the benefits and risks of taking the currently\nprescribed Zyprexa (Olanzapine), the court found, pursuant to section 1370, subdivision\n(a)(2)(B)(i)(I), that defendant lacked the capacity to make decisions regarding\nantipsychotic medication, that his diagnosed mental disorder required treatment with such\nmedication, and if his mental condition was left untreated, it was probable that serious\nharm to defendant\u2019s mental health would result. On this record, we cannot conclude the\ncourt erred in so finding.\n       Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that sections 1369 and 1370\nunconstitutionally violate his right to defend himself or to a speedy trial. The claim is\nforfeited because defendant did not raise these specific objections below. (See e.g.,\nPeople v.

We find no other arguable error\nthat would result in a disposition more favorable to defendant and affirm the judgment as\nmodified.\n\n                      FACTS AND HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n       In July 2019, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 19-1220 (case\nNo. 1220) with two felonies: conspiracy to commit theft (Pen. Code \u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1),\n484, subd. (a), 487, subd. (a) & 488 [count 1], statutory section citations that follow are\nfound in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated); possession of a billy or blackjack\n(\u00a7 22210 [count 2]); and three misdemeanors: prohibited interception of public safety\ncommunication (\u00a7 636.5 [count 3]); resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\n(\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1) [count 4]); and possession of a smoking device (Health & Saf. Code,\n\u00a7 11364, subd. (a) [count 5]). Defendant was released on his own recognizance.\n       In March 2020, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 20-348 (case\nNo. 348) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), count 1\n[against M.M. with a baseball bat], count 3 [against L.S. with a baseball bat] & count 6\n[against E.L. with a motor vehicle]); three counts of assault by means likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4), count 2 [M.M.], count 4 [L.S.] & count 7 [E.L.]);\nfirst degree felony burglary with a nonaccomplice present (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 667.5, subd. (c)(21),\ncount 5); and possession of a deadly weapon, a crossbow, with the intent to assault\nanother (\u00a7 17500; count 8). For counts 1 and 2, it was alleged that defendant personally\ninflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)), and for counts 1 through 7 it was\nalleged that defendant was released from custody on bail or his own recognizance in case\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 1220 at the time of the offenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In April 2020, defendant was again\nreleased on his own recognizance.\n       This brief factual summary is based on the police reports, which the parties\nstipulated to as the factual basis for defendant\u2019s pleas.\n       The charges in case No. 348 stemmed from police reports that defendant struck\nE.L. with a vehicle as he was riding his gas-powered bicycle, which was later stolen, and\nthat defendant assaulted L.S. and M.M. with a bat because he believed they had stolen\nproperty belonging to defendant\u2019s deceased father.\n       In March 2021, while out of custody, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County\ncase No. 21-376 (case No. 376) with attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated\nmurder (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), count 1 [victims Jane Doe and John Doe]); shooting at an\noccupied vehicle (\u00a7 246; count 2); and possession of a billy or blackjack (\u00a7 22210, count\n3). For count 1, it was alleged that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a\nfirearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)) and personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)).\nThe trial court revoked defendant\u2019s release and issued a criminal protective order for the\nvictims in case No. 376.\n       Regarding the charges in case No. 376, the victim had reported being shot at while\ndriving from a casino where defendant had repeatedly threatened her; a red truck with a\ndriver resembling defendant had followed her and fired shots at her car as the truck\npassed. A later search of the suspect vehicle located a container with defendant\u2019s name\non it, documents with the name of the person who was with the victim when she made the\npolice report, binoculars, a methamphetamine pipe, and several weapons. Law\nenforcement opined that defendant intended to kill the victim because he believed she\nwas involved in his father\u2019s death and stole his property.\n       The People moved to consolidate case No. 376 (defendant\u2019s attempted murder\ncase) with two pending cases against defendant Justin Ritchison. The court denied the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fmotion without prejudice to refile it following the preliminary hearing, which was set in\nJune 2021.\n       In May 2022, defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Ahart, declared a conflict based on his\nprior representation of two adverse material witnesses in case No. 348. He asked to be\nrelieved and to have Mr. Magid appointed as defendant\u2019s counsel. The court granted\ncounsel\u2019s request.\n       In September 2022, defendant reached a global plea agreement resolving all three\ncases for a stipulated upper term sentence of 15 years in state prison. The parties agreed\nto amend the complaint in case No. 376 to strike the premeditation and deliberation\nallegations; add a firearm enhancement under section 12022.4, subdivision (a) to count 1;\nand added a stalking charge as count 4. The parties stipulated to the police reports for\neach incident as the factual basis for his pleas.\n       In case No. 376, defendant pleaded guilty/no contest to one amended count of\nattempted murder (count 1) and one added count of stalking (\u00a7 646.9, count 4); admitted\nthe firearm enhancement added to count 1 (\u00a7 12022.4, subd. (a)); and admitted being\nreleased on bail or his own recognizance in case No. 348 and in case No. 1220 as to those\noffenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In case No. 348, defendant pleaded guilty/no contest to one count\nof assault with a deadly weapon (count 1), which was amended to include all three\nvictims, admitted that he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon during the\noffense (making the offense a strike), and pleaded no contest to residential burglary with\na person present (count 5) as a strike offense (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(21)).\n       We note that defendant checked the \u201cguilty\u201d box on his plea form. However,\nduring the plea hearing, defendant orally pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d to count 1 (attempted\nmurder) and \u201cguilty\u201d to count 4 (stalking) in case No. 376, and \u201cno contest\u201d to assault\nwith a deadly weapon (count 1) and first-degree residential burglary (count 5) in case\nNo. 348.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Under the terms of the agreement, after the completion of sentencing, all counts in\ncase No. 1220 were to be dismissed with a Harvey waiver and any remaining counts in\ncase No. 376 and case No. 348 would also be dismissed. Defendant stipulated to\naggravating factors to support upper term sentences, including that there was a pattern of\nviolence of increasing seriousness and that he was released on bail or his own\nrecognizance at the time of the offenses.\n       In October 2022, the trial court sentenced defendant to the stipulated 15-year term,\nwhich included the upper term of nine years for the attempted murder offense, a\nconsecutive upper term of three years for the attached firearm enhancement, consecutive\nterms of one year each for the out on bail or own recognizance enhancements, and a\nconcurrent term of two years for the stalking offense in case No. 376. The court\nsentenced defendant to a consecutive one year (one third the midterm) for the assault with\na deadly weapon conviction and a concurrent upper term of six years for the residential\nburglary offense in case No. 348. The court also issued a criminal protective order under\nsection 640.9, subdivision (k) in case No. 376.\n       After imposing sentence, the trial court advised defendant that his incarceration\nwould be followed by either three years post release community supervision under\nsection 3450 or three years parole under section 3000, subdivision (b)(1).\n       The court imposed a $300 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4), and a $300 parole revocation\nrestitution fine (\u00a7 1202.45) in case No. 376 and case No. 348, which were suspended\nunless parole was revoked, a $40 court security assessment per conviction (\u00a7 1465.8), a\n$30 criminal conviction assessment per conviction (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373), and a $10\ncrime prevention fee plus penalty assessments (\u00a7 1202.5) in case No. 348.\n       In case No. 376, the court awarded 582 actual days of credit plus 86 days of\nconduct credit for a total of 668 credit days. In case No. 348, the court awarded one\nactual day of credit. At appellate counsel\u2019s request pursuant to People v. Fares (1993)\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f16 Cal.App.4th 954, the trial court corrected its credit calculation by awarding defendant\ntwo additional days of credit in case No. 376.\n       In February 2023, defendant submitted a pro. per. notice of appeal requesting a\ncertificate of probable cause. This court granted defendant\u2019s request for permission to\nfile a notice of appeal under the constructive filing doctrine. The trial court then filed the\nnotice of appeal without granting a certificate of probable cause in March 2023.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       We appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. Counsel filed an opening\nbrief setting forth the facts of the case and requesting that this court review the record to\ndetermine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal. (People v. Wende, supra,\n25 Cal.3d 436.) Defendant was advised of his right to file a supplemental brief within 30\ndays of the date of filing of the opening brief. More than 30 days elapsed, and we\nreceived no communication from defendant.\n       After examining the record, we have discovered a clerical error in the judgment.\nThe parties contemplated dismissal of the remaining counts and enhancements after the\nplea in case No. 376 and case No. 348 and dismissal with a Harvey waiver of all the\ncounts in case No. 1220 as part of the plea agreement. The prosecutor stated that the\nPeople would move to dismiss the remaining counts after sentencing was completed. The\ntrial court, however, inadvertently failed to discuss or otherwise address dismissal of the\nremaining charges in case No. 376, case No. 348, or case No. 1220 after sentencing\ndefendant.\n       As the \u201ccourt may not proceed as to the plea other than as specified in the\n[approved] plea\u201d (\u00a7 1192.5), it follows the trial court\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing\nregarding dismissal of the remaining charges was not an exercise of judicial discretion\nbut, rather, a clerical mistake in creating a record of the judgment. (In re Candelario\n(1970) 3 Cal.3d 702, 705.) Accordingly, we will modify the judgment to reflect the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdismissal of counts 2 and 3 plus attached enhancements in case No. 376 as well as counts\n2 through 4 plus attached enhancements in case No. 348 and all the charges in case\nNo. 1220 as contemplated by the parties. Because the abstract of judgment properly\nreflects defendant\u2019s pleas to attempted murder and stalking in case No. 376 and to assault\nwith a deadly weapon and residential burglary in case No. 348, and no other counts, the\nabstract of judgment need not be amended in this regard.\n       However, we have found two additional errors on the abstract of judgment that\nrequire correction. The abstract reflects a $39 probation revocation restitution fine\nimposed under section 12022.44 in case No. 348, which the trial court never orally\nimposed. And, although the trial court imposed a $30 criminal conviction assessment for\neach of defendant\u2019s four convictions under Government Code section 70373, for a total\nassessment of $120, the abstract erroneously reflects a $130 criminal conviction\nassessment. \u201cWhere there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment\nand the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls.\u201d\n(People v. Zackery (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 380, 385, citing People v. Mitchell (2001)\n26 Cal.4th 181, 185-186 [appellate court with jurisdiction can order correction of\nabstracts of judgment that do not accurately reflect the oral judgments of sentencing\ncourts].) We shall direct that the abstract be corrected accordingly.\n       We find no other arguable error that would result in a disposition more favorable\nto defendant.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to dismiss count 2 and count 3 in case No. 376 and any\nattached enhancements, counts 2 through 4 in case No. 348 as well as any attached\nenhancements, and all charges in case No. 1220. As so modified, the judgment is\naffirmed. The clerk of the superior court shall prepare a corrected abstract of judgment\nthat deletes the $39 fine under section 12022.44 for case No. 348 and reflects a $120\ncriminal conviction assessment pursuant to Government Code section 70373.

We shall modify the judgment to dismiss the\nremaining counts as contemplated by the parties. We have also discovered errors in the\nabstract of judgment that we shall order be corrected. We find no other arguable error\nthat would result in a disposition more favorable to defendant and affirm the judgment as\nmodified.\n\n                      FACTS AND HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n       In July 2019, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 19-1220 (case\nNo. 1220) with two felonies: conspiracy to commit theft (Pen. Code \u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1),\n484, subd. (a), 487, subd. (a) &amp; 488 [count 1], statutory section citations that follow are\nfound in the Penal Code unless otherwise stated); possession of a billy or blackjack\n(\u00a7 22210 [count 2]); and three misdemeanors: prohibited interception of public safety\ncommunication (\u00a7 636.5 [count 3]); resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\n(\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1) [count 4]); and possession of a smoking device (Health &amp; Saf. Code,\n\u00a7 11364, subd. (a) [count 5]). Defendant was released on his own recognizance.\n       In March 2020, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County case No. 20-348 (case\nNo. 348) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), count 1\n[against M.M. with a baseball bat], count 3 [against L.S. with a baseball bat] &amp; count 6\n[against E.L. with a motor vehicle]); three counts of assault by means likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4), count 2 [M.M.], count 4 [L.S.] &amp; count 7 [E.L.]);\nfirst degree felony burglary with a nonaccomplice present (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 667.5, subd. (c)(21),\ncount 5); and possession of a deadly weapon, a crossbow, with the intent to assault\nanother (\u00a7 17500; count 8). For counts 1 and 2, it was alleged that defendant personally\ninflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)), and for counts 1 through 7 it was\nalleged that defendant was released from custody on bail or his own recognizance in case\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 1220 at the time of the offenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In April 2020, defendant was again\nreleased on his own recognizance.\n       This brief factual summary is based on the police reports, which the parties\nstipulated to as the factual basis for defendant\u2019s pleas.\n       The charges in case No. 348 stemmed from police reports that defendant struck\nE.L. with a vehicle as he was riding his gas-powered bicycle, which was later stolen, and\nthat defendant assaulted L.S. and M.M. with a bat because he believed they had stolen\nproperty belonging to defendant\u2019s deceased father.\n       In March 2021, while out of custody, defendant was charged in Siskiyou County\ncase No. 21-376 (case No. 376) with attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated\nmurder (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), count 1 [victims Jane Doe and John Doe]); shooting at an\noccupied vehicle (\u00a7 246; count 2); and possession of a billy or blackjack (\u00a7 22210, count\n3). For count 1, it was alleged that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a\nfirearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)) and personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)).\nThe trial court revoked defendant\u2019s release and issued a criminal protective order for the\nvictims in case No. 376.\n       Regarding the charges in case No. 376, the victim had reported being shot at while\ndriving from a casino where defendant had repeatedly threatened her; a red truck with a\ndriver resembling defendant had followed her and fired shots at her car as the truck\npassed. A later search of the suspect vehicle located a container with defendant\u2019s name\non it, documents with the name of the person who was with the victim when she made the\npolice report, binoculars, a methamphetamine pipe, and several weapons. Law\nenforcement opined that defendant intended to kill the victim because he believed she\nwas involved in his father\u2019s death and stole his property.\n       The People moved to consolidate case No. 376 (defendant\u2019s attempted murder\ncase) with two pending cases against defendant Justin Ritchison. The court denied the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fmotion without prejudice to refile it following the preliminary hearing, which was set in\nJune 2021.\n       In May 2022, defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Ahart, declared a conflict based on his\nprior representation of two adverse material witnesses in case No. 348. He asked to be\nrelieved and to have Mr. Magid appointed as defendant\u2019s counsel. The court granted\ncounsel\u2019s request.\n       In September 2022, defendant reached a global plea agreement resolving all three\ncases for a stipulated upper term sentence of 15 years in state prison. The parties agreed\nto amend the complaint in case No. 376 to strike the premeditation and deliberation\nallegations; add a firearm enhancement under section 12022.4, subdivision (a) to count 1;\nand added a stalking charge as count 4. The parties stipulated to the police reports for\neach incident as the factual basis for his pleas.\n       In case No. 376, defendant pleaded guilty/no contest to one amended count of\nattempted murder (count 1) and one added count of stalking (\u00a7 646.9, count 4); admitted\nthe firearm enhancement added to count 1 (\u00a7 12022.4, subd. (a)); and admitted being\nreleased on bail or his own recognizance in case No. 348 and in case No. 1220 as to those\noffenses (\u00a7 12022.1). In case No. 348, defendant pleaded guilty/no contest to one count\nof assault with a deadly weapon (count 1), which was amended to include all three\nvictims, admitted that he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon during the\noffense (making the offense a strike), and pleaded no contest to residential burglary with\na person present (count 5) as a strike offense (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(21)).\n       We note that defendant checked the \u201cguilty\u201d box on his plea form. However,\nduring the plea hearing, defendant orally pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d to count 1 (attempted\nmurder) and \u201cguilty\u201d to count 4 (stalking) in case No. 376, and \u201cno contest\u201d to assault\nwith a deadly weapon (count 1) and first-degree residential burglary (count 5) in case\nNo. 348.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Under the terms of the agreement, after the completion of sentencing, all counts in\ncase No. 1220 were to be dismissed with a Harvey waiver and any remaining counts in\ncase No. 376 and case No. 348 would also be dismissed. Defendant stipulated to\naggravating factors to support upper term sentences, including that there was a pattern of\nviolence of increasing seriousness and that he was released on bail or his own\nrecognizance at the time of the offenses.\n       In October 2022, the trial court sentenced defendant to the stipulated 15-year term,\nwhich included the upper term of nine years for the attempted murder offense, a\nconsecutive upper term of three years for the attached firearm enhancement, consecutive\nterms of one year each for the out on bail or own recognizance enhancements, and a\nconcurrent term of two years for the stalking offense in case No. 376. The court\nsentenced defendant to a consecutive one year (one third the midterm) for the assault with\na deadly weapon conviction and a concurrent upper term of six years for the residential\nburglary offense in case No. 348. The court also issued a criminal protective order under\nsection 640.9, subdivision (k) in case No. 376.\n       After imposing sentence, the trial court advised defendant that his incarceration\nwould be followed by either three years post release community supervision under\nsection 3450 or three years parole under section 3000, subdivision (b)(1).\n       The court imposed a $300 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4), and a $300 parole revocation\nrestitution fine (\u00a7 1202.45) in case No. 376 and case No. 348, which were suspended\nunless parole was revoked, a $40 court security assessment per conviction (\u00a7 1465.8), a\n$30 criminal conviction assessment per conviction (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373), and a $10\ncrime prevention fee plus penalty assessments (\u00a7 1202.5) in case No. 348.\n       In case No. 376, the court awarded 582 actual days of credit plus 86 days of\nconduct credit for a total of 668 credit days. In case No. 348, the court awarded one\nactual day of credit. At appellate counsel\u2019s request pursuant to People v. Fares (1993)\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253380\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253380/people-v-fares/\">16 Cal.App.4th 954</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the trial court corrected its credit calculation by awarding defendant\ntwo additional days of credit in case No. 376.\n       In February 2023, defendant submitted a pro. per. notice of appeal requesting a\ncertificate of probable cause. This court granted defendant\u2019s request for permission to\nfile a notice of appeal under the constructive filing doctrine. The trial court then filed the\nnotice of appeal without granting a certificate of probable cause in March 2023.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       We appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. Counsel filed an opening\nbrief setting forth the facts of the case and requesting that this court review the record to\ndetermine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal. (People v. Wende, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 Cal.3d 436</span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Defendant was advised of his right to file a supplemental brief within 30\ndays of the date of filing of the opening brief. More than 30 days elapsed, and we\nreceived no communication from defendant.\n       After examining the record, we have discovered a clerical error in the judgment.\nThe parties contemplated dismissal of the remaining counts and enhancements after the\nplea in case No. 376 and case No. 348 and dismissal with a Harvey waiver of all the\ncounts in case No. 1220 as part of the plea agreement. The prosecutor stated that the\nPeople would move to dismiss the remaining counts after sentencing was completed. The\ntrial court, however, inadvertently failed to discuss or otherwise address dismissal of the\nremaining charges in case No. 376, case No. 348, or case No. 1220 after sentencing\ndefendant.\n       As the \u201ccourt may not proceed as to the plea other than as specified in the\n[approved] plea\u201d (\u00a7 1192.5), it follows the trial court\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing\nregarding dismissal of the remaining charges was not an exercise of judicial discretion\nbut, rather, a clerical mistake in creating a record of the judgment. (In re Candelario\n(1970) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 Cal.3d 702</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705.) Accordingly, we will modify the judgment to reflect the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdismissal of counts 2 and 3 plus attached enhancements in case No. 376 as well as counts\n2 through 4 plus attached enhancements in case No. 348 and all the charges in case\nNo. 1220 as contemplated by the parties. Because the abstract of judgment properly\nreflects defendant\u2019s pleas to attempted murder and stalking in case No. 376 and to assault\nwith a deadly weapon and residential burglary in case No. 348, and no other counts, the\nabstract of judgment need not be amended in this regard.\n       However, we have found two additional errors on the abstract of judgment that\nrequire correction. The abstract reflects a $39 probation revocation restitution fine\nimposed under section 12022.44 in case No. 348, which the trial court never orally\nimposed. And, although the trial court imposed a $30 criminal conviction assessment for\neach of defendant\u2019s four convictions under Government Code section 70373, for a total\nassessment of $120, the abstract erroneously reflects a $130 criminal conviction\nassessment. \u201cWhere there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment\nand the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls.\u201d\n(People v.

We shall direct that the abstract be corrected accordingly.\n       We find no other arguable error that would result in a disposition more favorable\nto defendant.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to dismiss count 2 and count 3 in case No. 376 and any\nattached enhancements, counts 2 through 4 in case No. 348 as well as any attached\nenhancements, and all charges in case No. 1220. As so modified, the judgment is\naffirmed. The clerk of the superior court shall prepare a corrected abstract of judgment\nthat deletes the $39 fine under section 12022.44 for case No. 348 and reflects a $120\ncriminal conviction assessment pursuant to Government Code section 70373.

Code,\n          1\n\u00a7 1172.6). Tapia and four codefendants\u2014Juan Rivera, Carlos Diaz, Guadalupe Vertiz,\nand Jorge Castro\u2014were convicted in 1998 of second degree murder for the stabbing\ndeath of Cesar Arroyo. The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition without\nissuing an order to show cause on the ground the record of conviction, including Tapia\u2019s\ntestimony, established beyond dispute that Tapia was the actual killer. We conclude the\ntrial court should have issued an order to show cause and conducted an evidentiary\nhearing and, therefore, reverse and remand for those purposes.\n\n\n                                          FACTS\nI. Attack and Killing of Arroyo\n              On March 14, 1996, at around 9:20 a.m., K.L., her boyfriend Cesar Arroyo,\nand her sister L.L. were walking northbound on Standard Street in Santa Ana on their\nway to a grocery store. A brown-colored car approached them from the opposite\ndirection, made a U-turn, and pulled up beside them. Rivera jumped out of the car and,\nwith a beer can in his hand, asked Arroyo, \u201c\u2018Where you from?\u2019\u201d Arroyo responded, \u201c\u2018I\ndon\u2019t claim.\u201d When Rivera asked him again, Arroyo insisted, \u201c\u2018Really I don\u2019t claim.\u2019\u201d\nRivera proclaimed, \u201c\u2018We\u2019re from Lopers,\u201d or \u201c\u2018big, bad Lopers\u2019\u201d and threw the beer can\nat Arroyo. K.L. interceded, and the beer can hit her on the head.\n              Tapia, Diaz, Vertiz, and Castro then jumped out of the car and with Rivera,\nstarted beating Arroyo. Arroyo, who was five feet 5 inches tall and weighed 131 pounds,\ndid not fight back. After a minute or two of being beaten, Arroyo fell to the ground\nagainst the fence. He tried to cover and protect himself while Tapia and his codefendants\n\n              1\n                 Effective June 30, 2022, Penal Code section 1170.95 was renumbered\nsection 1172.6, with no change in text (Stats. 2022, ch. 58, \u00a7 10). All statutory references\nare to the Penal Code.\n\n                                             2\n\fcontinued to assault him. They continued to kick and hit Arroyo for five to six minutes\n                        2\nas he lay on the ground. Tapia and Vertiz punched K.L. when she tried to pull them off\nof Arroyo.\n              At some point, Tapia stepped away and stood behind L.L. A few seconds\nlater, three of the defendants got back into the car while another stood at the back of the\ncar and waited. Arroyo managed to stand up. One defendant, identified as wearing a\nblue shirt and dark, square pants, went up to Arroyo and pushed him in the chest. Arroyo\nstarted walking, then stumbled and fell to the ground.\n              The defendant who pushed Arroyo walked back to the car and got in. Once\nall five were inside, they drove away.\n              L.L. went to seek help, and police officers arrived shortly thereafter.\nArroyo had been stabbed several times and later died from his wounds.\n              Police officers took K.L. and L.L. to a liquor store where the officers had\npulled over a car matching the description of the car the defendants were in. Tapia and\nhis four codefendants were inside the car. Both K.L. and L.L. identified Tapia as having\nparticipated in the attack on Arroyo.\n\n\nII. Arroyo\u2019s Autopsy\n              Joseph Halka, a pathologist for the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner,\nperformed an autopsy on Arroyo\u2019s body. Halka testified that Arroyo died from\nexsanguination (he bled to death) caused by a stab wound to the heart and left lung.\nHalka found a total of seven stab or slash wounds. The wound to the heart was caused by\na knife with a \u201ctwo-edged configuration,\u201d meaning it was sharp on both edges or sides.\nBefore Arroyo died, emergency surgery had been performed that altered \u201csome of the\n\n              2\n                K.L. testified that while Arroyo was on the ground the defendants hit and\nkicked him. L.L. testified that four of the five defendants \u201cpiled on\u201d Arroyo as he lay on\nthe ground and one defendant stood behind her.\n\n                                              3\n\fcontours\u201d of the wounds. The remaining knife wounds, including defensive slash and\n\u201cpunctate\u201d wounds, were nonfatal and could have been caused by either a two-edged\nknife or a one-edged knife. Arroyo also had bruises and contusions on his body.\n\n\nIII. Tapia\u2019s Police Interview and Trial Testimony\n               Police investigators interviewed Tapia early on March 15, 1996. Tapia\nadmitted that he and his fellow gang members had attacked Arroyo but repeatedly denied\nhaving used a weapon. Tapia told the investigators that, before the attack, \u201cthe other\nguys said, \u2018watch that guy,\u2019\u201d with reference to Arroyo. Diaz (the driver) stopped the car,\neveryone got out, and they started attacking Arroyo. When asked why Tapia attacked\nArroyo, Tapia responded, \u201cBut was very \u2014 if you see him in the street like that, you\u2019re\ngoing to figure he\u2019s a gang member, and you\u2019re going to stop him, and you\u2019re going to\nsay hey, you understand me?\u201d Tapia claimed he did not have any weapons and did not\nstab Arroyo.\n               At trial, Tapia testified he was the one who stabbed Arroyo and he had lied\nto police when he was arrested. He testified he did have a knife in his pants\u2019 pocket and\n                                                                                 3\nhad obtained the knife from work at a Del Taco, where he use it to cut up boxes. The\nknife was \u201cstraight\u201d (as opposed to being a folding knife), had a three-inch blade and a\nthree-inch handle, and was sharp on both edges. He did not have a sheath or pouch for\nthe knife but on March 14, 1996, he was wearing oversized pants with huge pockets that\ncould accommodate the knife. Tapia testified he had forgotten about the knife when he\nleft work at 4:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                 Payroll records for the Del Taco showed that Tapia had last worked there\non February 15, 1995. Tapia\u2019s father, who was the manager of the Del Taco, testified\nthat knives that were sharp on both edges were used at that Del Taco and that he had not\nseen such a knife at the store in March 1996.\n\n                                             4\n\f              Tapia testified that he and his codefendants did not have any discussion\nabout getting into a fight. Tapia had been drinking earlier that night and was drunk.\nTapia claimed that as the five drove past Arroyo he screamed, \u201cLittle Minnie Locotes\u201d\nand lifted his hand with five fingers outstretched at a 45-degree angle. The car made a\nU-turn and all five passengers got out of the car and attacked Arroyo. Tapia took out the\nknife and stabbed Arroyo. Tapia remembered stabbing Arroyo a few times. Tapia did\nnot remember how it happened because he was drunk and did not recall why he stabbed\nArroyo. When he realized he was stabbing Arroyo with a knife, Tapia got scared and ran\nback to the car. He did not think he had seriously injured Arroyo because Arroyo was\nstill standing and walking.\n              Tapia and his codefendants got back into the car and drove off. Later they\nreturned to the place where they had attacked Arroyo and saw an ambulance. They then\ndrove to a liquor store to buy more beer. Soon thereafter, they were stopped by police\nofficers and arrested.\n              At first, Tapia claimed that he could not remember what he did with the\nknife. But he then testified that he had tossed the knife out of the driver\u2019s side window\nwhile on the way to the liquor store. Tapia claimed none of his codefendants knew he\nhad a knife, that he had stabbed Arroyo, or that he had tossed the knife out the window.\n\n\n                                PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nI. The Jury Trial Leading to Tapia\u2019s Conviction for Second Degree Murder\n              Tapia and the four other defendants were charged by amended information\nfiled in 1997, with the murder of Arroyo. It was alleged the murder was committed for\nthe benefit of, at the direction of and in association with a criminal street gang.\n(\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)\n              In May 1998 Tapia and his codefendants were tried together by jury.\nOutside the jury\u2019s presence all defendants admitted that they were members of the\n\n                                              5\n\fLopers, that the Lopers was a criminal street gang, and any alleged crimes they were\nconvicted of committing had been committed for the benefit of the Lopers.\n              The jury was instructed on aiding and abetting, conspiracy, murder, express\nand implied malice, attempted murder, second degree murder resulting from an unlawful\nact dangerous to life, and the lesser included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon,\nsimple battery, and simple assault.\n              The jury convicted all defendants of second degree murder. The jury found\nthat Tapia had personally used a knife at the time of the commission of the murder.\n              The trial court sentenced Tapia to a term of 28 years to life in prison, which\nincluded a principal term of 15 years to life for murder, four years for enhancements, and\nnine years for other offenses not relevant here.\n              Tapia and the other defendants appealed. In an unpublished opinion, a\npanel of this court remanded for reconsideration of presentence custody credits award but\notherwise affirmed the judgment and sentence. (People v. Diaz et al. (Mar. 28, 2001,\nG023892).)\n\n\nII. Tapia\u2019s Petition for Resentencing\n              In April 2022, Tapia filed a petition for resentencing under section 1172.6.\nIn a written response, the prosecution argued the petition should be denied at the prima\nfacie stage because the record of conviction, based on the jury\u2019s true finding that Tapia\npersonally used a deadly weapon, established he was the actual killer.\n              Tapia, for whom counsel had been appointed, filed a brief in support of\nresentencing and argued that an order to show cause should be issued based on his\nallegations that he was eligible for relief. Tapia argued the jury\u2019s true finding that he\npersonally used a knife in the murder did not necessarily mean the jury had found he was\nthe actual killer because it could have found that he displayed the knife or struck the\nvictim with its butt end.\n\n                                              6\n\f              The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition at a hearing held on\nSeptember 8, 2022. Tapia filed a notice of appeal on the same day. About one month\nlater the trial court issued a statement of decision. The court found: \u201cThe record of\nconviction, including Petitioner\u2019s own testimony before the jury in this case conclusively\nshows that petitioner was the actual killer. [\u00b6] As the actual killer, petitioner would be\nguilty of murder under the current law and is ineligible for resentencing under Section\n1172.6.\u201d\n\n\n              PROCEDURE AND STANDARDS UNDER SECTION 1172.6\n               By legislation effective January 1, 2019, the Legislature amended the\nfelony-murder rule and eliminated the natural and probable consequences doctrine of\nliability as a basis for a murder conviction. (Stats, 2018, ch. 1015, \u00a7 2; see People v.\nReyes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 981, 984.) The latter result was accomplished by amending\nsection 188 to provide that, except in cases of felony murder, \u201cin order to be convicted of\nmurder, a principal in a crime shall act with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 188, subd. (a)(3).)\n              To obtain relief under section 1172.6, a petitioner must file in the\nsentencing court a petition alleging these three conditions have been met: (1) the\npetitioner was convicted based on a pleading \u201cthat allowed the prosecution to proceed\nunder a theory of felony murder, murder under the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine or other theory under which malice is imputed to a person based solely on that\nperson\u2019s participation in a crime\u201d (\u00a7 1172.6, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the petitioner was\nconvicted of murder or attempted murder (id., subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the petitioner could\nnot now be convicted of murder or attempted murder as those offenses are presently\ndefined (id., subd. (a)(3)).\n              If the petition satisfies certain technical requirements, then the trial court\nappoints counsel if the petitioner has requested counsel. (\u00a7 1176.2, subd. (b)(3).) Next,\n\u201cthe prosecutor shall file and serve a response,\u201d and \u201c[t]he petitioner may file and serve a\n\n                                              7\n\freply within 30 days after the prosecutor\u2019s response is served.\u201d (Id., subd. (c).) Once\nbriefing is completed, the trial court determines whether the petitioner has made a prima\nfacie case for relief. (Ibid.) If the court finds the petitioner has made a prima facie case,\nthen the court must issue an order to show cause. (Ibid.)\n                 In determining whether the petitioner has made a prima facie case for relief\nunder section 1172.6, the trial court\u2019s inquiry is limited: The court, accepting the\npetition\u2019s factual allegations as true, makes a \u201c\u2018\u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d\u2019\u201d whether the\npetitioner would be entitled to relief if those allegations were proven. (People v. Lewis\n(2021) 11 Cal.5th 952, 971 (Lewis).) \u201c\u2018\u201cIf so, the court must issue an order to show\ncause.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Ibid.) Within 60 days of issuance of the order to show cause, the trial court\nmust hold a hearing to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to relief. (\u00a71172.6,\nsubd. (d)(1).)\n                 If counsel is appointed and the parties are given the opportunity for\nbriefing, the trial court may rely on the record of conviction to determine whether the\npetitioner has made a prima facie case for relief under section 1172.6. (Lewis, supra, 11\nCal.5th at p. 957.) \u201cThe record of conviction may include the underlying facts as\npresented in an appellate opinion, the trial evidence, the jury instructions, and closing\narguments of counsel.\u201d (People v. Lopez (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 1, 13.) \u201cThe record of\nconviction will necessarily inform the trial court\u2019s prima facie inquiry under section\n[1172.6], allowing the court to distinguish petitions with potential merit from those that\nare clearly meritless.\u201d (Lewis, at p. 971.) \u201cIn sum, the parties can, and should, use the\nrecord of conviction to aid the trial court in reliably assessing whether a petitioner has\nmade a prima facie case for relief under subdivision (c) [of section 1172.6].\u201d (Id. at p.\n972.)\n                 \u201cIn reviewing any part of the record of conviction at this preliminary\njuncture, a trial court should not engage in \u2018factfinding involving the weighing of\nevidence or the exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 972.) \u201cWhile the\n\n                                                8\n\ftrial court may look at the record of conviction after the appointment of counsel to\ndetermine whether a petitioner has made a prima facie case for section [1172.6] relief, the\nprima facie inquiry under subdivision (c) is limited. Like the analogous prima facie\ninquiry in habeas corpus proceedings, \u2018\u201cthe court takes petitioner\u2019s factual allegations as\ntrue and makes a preliminary assessment regarding whether the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief if his or her factual allegations were proved. If so, the court must issue\nan order to show cause.\u201d\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018[A] court should not reject the petitioner\u2019s factual\nallegations on credibility grounds without first conducting an evidentiary hearing.\u2019\n[Citations.] \u2018However, if the record, including the court\u2019s own documents, \u201ccontain[s]\nfacts refuting the allegations made in the petition,\u201d then \u201cthe court is justified in making a\ncredibility determination adverse to the petitioner.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 971.)\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI. Standard of Review and Standard for Denying Relief Under Section 1172.6\n              The trial court denied defendant\u2019s resentencing petition on the ground\ndefendant had failed to make a prima facie case for resentencing relief. Denial of a\nresentencing petition at the prima facie stage is warranted only if the record of conviction\ndemonstrates the petitioner is ineligible for relief as a matter of law. (People v. Lopez,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.) That is a purely legal conclusion subject de novo review.\n(Ibid.)\n              \u201cA petitioner is ineligible for resentencing as a matter of law if the record\nof conviction conclusively establishes, with no factfinding, weighing of evidence, or\ncredibility determinations, that (1) the petitioner was the actual killer, or (2) the petitioner\nwas not the actual killer, but, with the intent to kill, aided, abetted, counseled,\ncommanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer in the commission\nof murder in the first degree, (3) the petitioner was a major participant in the underlying\nfelony and acted with reckless indifference to human life, or (4) the petitioner acted with\n\n                                               9\n\fmalice aforethought that was not imputed based solely on participation in a crime.\u201d\n(People v. Lopez, supra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.)\n\n\nII. Tapia Is Entitled to an Evidentiary Hearing\n              Tapia argues he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his resentencing\npetition because the record of conviction does not conclusively establish as a matter of\nlaw that he is ineligible for relief. Although Tapia testified he had stabbed Arroyo, Tapia\nargues that one or more of the jurors might have disbelieved that testimony, as well as his\ntestimony that he was not threatened by any codefendant, and found him liable under a\nnow impermissible theory, in particular, the natural and probable consequences doctrine.\nTapia contends the trial court engaged in factfinding by finding that he was the actual\nkiller.\n              We agree that the record of conviction does not conclusively establish that\nTapia is ineligible for relief. The jurors, who were instructed that they were \u201cthe sole\njudges of the believability of a witness,\u201d might have disbelieved Tapia\u2019s testimony. The\nprosecutor left open the possibility that Tapia was not the stabber. In closing, the\nprosecutor argued, \u201c[I]f you believe, as jurors, that one of the defendants was the stabber,\nwhich the evidence obviously shows, in fact, Mr. Tapia admitted being the stabber, but as\nyou will see when I go through the law dealing with group liability, which is the\nuncharged conspiracy or aiding and abetting, either of those theories, that the law holds\nall five defendants accountable even though only one of those defendants may be the\nstabber. The prosecutor also told the jury, \u201cWhoever the stabber was, whether you\nbelieve it was Mr. Tapia, as he said, or it\u2019s one of the other defendants, that person\nclearly acted with the express intent to kill.\u201d (Italics added.)\n              The jury\u2019s true finding on the knife-use enhancement does not conclusively\nestablish that Tapia was the stabber. The jury was instructed on personal use of a deadly\nor dangerous weapon and in that instruction was told \u201cthe term \u2018personally used a deadly\n\n                                              10\n\for dangerous weapon,\u2019 as used in this instruction, means the defendant must have\nintentionally displayed a weapon in a menacing manner or intentionally fired it or\nintentionally struck or hit a human being with it.\u201d That instruction did not require the\njury to find that Tapia stabbed Arroyo and killed him in order to return a true finding.\nIndeed, the verdict returned by the jury did not even find that Tapia had used a knife in\nthe commission of the murder: The verdict on the dangerous weapon enhancement states\nonly that the jury found that Tapia \u201cpersonally used a deadly or dangerous weapon,\nto-wit: KNIFE, at the time of the commission of the offense alleged in COUNT 1\n[murder].\u201d (Italics added.) The jury might have found that Tapia brandished the knife,\ndelivered the nonfatal stabs, or used the knife for a purpose unrelated to the murder at the\ntime the offense was committed.\n              At trial, the prosecutor argued strenuously that all defendants were guilty of\nmurder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. Without factfinding, the\nrecord does not foreclose the possibility that Tapia was convicted under that doctrine.\n              Given the record of conviction, and Tapia\u2019s testimony in particular, it might\nseem unlikely that the jury found anybody other than Tapia to be the actual killer.\nTapia\u2019s trial testimony, if believed, would be substantial evidence that Tapia was in fact\nthe actual killer. But such a credibility determination would be inappropriate at the prima\nfacie stage because the record does not positively refute the allegations of Tapia\u2019s\nresentencing petition. (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 971.) At the prima facie stage, the\nstandard is that the record of conviction must conclusively establish that Tapia is\nineligible for relief as a matter of law. We cannot say it does. An evidentiary hearing is\ntherefore in order.\n              Our opinion should not be read as indicating whether the trial court should\ngrant or deny Tapia resentencing relief. Exercising de novo review, we conclude only\nthat Tapia has met his burden of making a prima facie case for relief under section\n1172.6, subdivision (c).\n\n                                             11\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n              The postjudgment order is reversed and the matter is remanded with\ndirections to the trial court to issue an order to show cause and conduct an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n\n                                                 SANCHEZ, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nBEDSWORTH, ACTING P.

Code,\n          1\n\u00a7 1172.6). Tapia and four codefendants\u2014Juan Rivera, Carlos Diaz, Guadalupe Vertiz,\nand Jorge Castro\u2014were convicted in 1998 of second degree murder for the stabbing\ndeath of Cesar Arroyo. The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition without\nissuing an order to show cause on the ground the record of conviction, including Tapia\u2019s\ntestimony, established beyond dispute that Tapia was the actual killer. We conclude the\ntrial court should have issued an order to show cause and conducted an evidentiary\nhearing and, therefore, reverse and remand for those purposes.\n\n\n                                          FACTS\nI. Attack and Killing of Arroyo\n              On March 14, 1996, at around 9:20 a.m., K.L., her boyfriend Cesar Arroyo,\nand her sister L.L. were walking northbound on Standard Street in Santa Ana on their\nway to a grocery store. A brown-colored car approached them from the opposite\ndirection, made a U-turn, and pulled up beside them. Rivera jumped out of the car and,\nwith a beer can in his hand, asked Arroyo, \u201c\u2018Where you from?\u2019\u201d Arroyo responded, \u201c\u2018I\ndon\u2019t claim.\u201d When Rivera asked him again, Arroyo insisted, \u201c\u2018Really I don\u2019t claim.\u2019\u201d\nRivera proclaimed, \u201c\u2018We\u2019re from Lopers,\u201d or \u201c\u2018big, bad Lopers\u2019\u201d and threw the beer can\nat Arroyo. K.L. interceded, and the beer can hit her on the head.\n              Tapia, Diaz, Vertiz, and Castro then jumped out of the car and with Rivera,\nstarted beating Arroyo. Arroyo, who was five feet 5 inches tall and weighed 131 pounds,\ndid not fight back. After a minute or two of being beaten, Arroyo fell to the ground\nagainst the fence. He tried to cover and protect himself while Tapia and his codefendants\n\n              1\n                 Effective June 30, 2022, Penal Code section 1170.95 was renumbered\nsection 1172.6, with no change in text (Stats. 2022, ch. 58, \u00a7 10).

They continued to kick and hit Arroyo for five to six minutes\n                        2\nas he lay on the ground. Tapia and Vertiz punched K.L. when she tried to pull them off\nof Arroyo.\n              At some point, Tapia stepped away and stood behind L.L. A few seconds\nlater, three of the defendants got back into the car while another stood at the back of the\ncar and waited. Arroyo managed to stand up. One defendant, identified as wearing a\nblue shirt and dark, square pants, went up to Arroyo and pushed him in the chest. Arroyo\nstarted walking, then stumbled and fell to the ground.\n              The defendant who pushed Arroyo walked back to the car and got in. Once\nall five were inside, they drove away.\n              L.L. went to seek help, and police officers arrived shortly thereafter.\nArroyo had been stabbed several times and later died from his wounds.\n              Police officers took K.L. and L.L. to a liquor store where the officers had\npulled over a car matching the description of the car the defendants were in. Tapia and\nhis four codefendants were inside the car. Both K.L. and L.L. identified Tapia as having\nparticipated in the attack on Arroyo.\n\n\nII. Arroyo\u2019s Autopsy\n              Joseph Halka, a pathologist for the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner,\nperformed an autopsy on Arroyo\u2019s body. Halka testified that Arroyo died from\nexsanguination (he bled to death) caused by a stab wound to the heart and left lung.\nHalka found a total of seven stab or slash wounds. The wound to the heart was caused by\na knife with a \u201ctwo-edged configuration,\u201d meaning it was sharp on both edges or sides.\nBefore Arroyo died, emergency surgery had been performed that altered \u201csome of the\n\n              2\n                K.L. testified that while Arroyo was on the ground the defendants hit and\nkicked him. L.L. testified that four of the five defendants \u201cpiled on\u201d Arroyo as he lay on\nthe ground and one defendant stood behind her.\n\n                                              3\n\fcontours\u201d of the wounds. The remaining knife wounds, including defensive slash and\n\u201cpunctate\u201d wounds, were nonfatal and could have been caused by either a two-edged\nknife or a one-edged knife. Arroyo also had bruises and contusions on his body.\n\n\nIII. Tapia\u2019s Police Interview and Trial Testimony\n               Police investigators interviewed Tapia early on March 15, 1996. Tapia\nadmitted that he and his fellow gang members had attacked Arroyo but repeatedly denied\nhaving used a weapon. Tapia told the investigators that, before the attack, \u201cthe other\nguys said, \u2018watch that guy,\u2019\u201d with reference to Arroyo. Diaz (the driver) stopped the car,\neveryone got out, and they started attacking Arroyo. When asked why Tapia attacked\nArroyo, Tapia responded, \u201cBut was very \u2014 if you see him in the street like that, you\u2019re\ngoing to figure he\u2019s a gang member, and you\u2019re going to stop him, and you\u2019re going to\nsay hey, you understand me?\u201d Tapia claimed he did not have any weapons and did not\nstab Arroyo.\n               At trial, Tapia testified he was the one who stabbed Arroyo and he had lied\nto police when he was arrested. He testified he did have a knife in his pants\u2019 pocket and\n                                                                                 3\nhad obtained the knife from work at a Del Taco, where he use it to cut up boxes. The\nknife was \u201cstraight\u201d (as opposed to being a folding knife), had a three-inch blade and a\nthree-inch handle, and was sharp on both edges. He did not have a sheath or pouch for\nthe knife but on March 14, 1996, he was wearing oversized pants with huge pockets that\ncould accommodate the knife. Tapia testified he had forgotten about the knife when he\nleft work at 4:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                 Payroll records for the Del Taco showed that Tapia had last worked there\non February 15, 1995. Tapia\u2019s father, who was the manager of the Del Taco, testified\nthat knives that were sharp on both edges were used at that Del Taco and that he had not\nseen such a knife at the store in March 1996.\n\n                                             4\n\f              Tapia testified that he and his codefendants did not have any discussion\nabout getting into a fight. Tapia had been drinking earlier that night and was drunk.\nTapia claimed that as the five drove past Arroyo he screamed, \u201cLittle Minnie Locotes\u201d\nand lifted his hand with five fingers outstretched at a 45-degree angle. The car made a\nU-turn and all five passengers got out of the car and attacked Arroyo. Tapia took out the\nknife and stabbed Arroyo. Tapia remembered stabbing Arroyo a few times. Tapia did\nnot remember how it happened because he was drunk and did not recall why he stabbed\nArroyo. When he realized he was stabbing Arroyo with a knife, Tapia got scared and ran\nback to the car. He did not think he had seriously injured Arroyo because Arroyo was\nstill standing and walking.\n              Tapia and his codefendants got back into the car and drove off. Later they\nreturned to the place where they had attacked Arroyo and saw an ambulance. They then\ndrove to a liquor store to buy more beer. Soon thereafter, they were stopped by police\nofficers and arrested.\n              At first, Tapia claimed that he could not remember what he did with the\nknife. But he then testified that he had tossed the knife out of the driver\u2019s side window\nwhile on the way to the liquor store. Tapia claimed none of his codefendants knew he\nhad a knife, that he had stabbed Arroyo, or that he had tossed the knife out the window.\n\n\n                                PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nI. The Jury Trial Leading to Tapia\u2019s Conviction for Second Degree Murder\n              Tapia and the four other defendants were charged by amended information\nfiled in 1997, with the murder of Arroyo. It was alleged the murder was committed for\nthe benefit of, at the direction of and in association with a criminal street gang.\n(\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)\n              In May 1998 Tapia and his codefendants were tried together by jury.\nOutside the jury\u2019s presence all defendants admitted that they were members of the\n\n                                              5\n\fLopers, that the Lopers was a criminal street gang, and any alleged crimes they were\nconvicted of committing had been committed for the benefit of the Lopers.\n              The jury was instructed on aiding and abetting, conspiracy, murder, express\nand implied malice, attempted murder, second degree murder resulting from an unlawful\nact dangerous to life, and the lesser included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon,\nsimple battery, and simple assault.\n              The jury convicted all defendants of second degree murder. The jury found\nthat Tapia had personally used a knife at the time of the commission of the murder.\n              The trial court sentenced Tapia to a term of 28 years to life in prison, which\nincluded a principal term of 15 years to life for murder, four years for enhancements, and\nnine years for other offenses not relevant here.\n              Tapia and the other defendants appealed. In an unpublished opinion, a\npanel of this court remanded for reconsideration of presentence custody credits award but\notherwise affirmed the judgment and sentence. (People v. Diaz et al. (Mar. 28, 2001,\nG023892).)\n\n\nII. Tapia\u2019s Petition for Resentencing\n              In April 2022, Tapia filed a petition for resentencing under section 1172.6.\nIn a written response, the prosecution argued the petition should be denied at the prima\nfacie stage because the record of conviction, based on the jury\u2019s true finding that Tapia\npersonally used a deadly weapon, established he was the actual killer.\n              Tapia, for whom counsel had been appointed, filed a brief in support of\nresentencing and argued that an order to show cause should be issued based on his\nallegations that he was eligible for relief. Tapia argued the jury\u2019s true finding that he\npersonally used a knife in the murder did not necessarily mean the jury had found he was\nthe actual killer because it could have found that he displayed the knife or struck the\nvictim with its butt end.\n\n                                              6\n\f              The trial court denied Tapia\u2019s resentencing petition at a hearing held on\nSeptember 8, 2022. Tapia filed a notice of appeal on the same day. About one month\nlater the trial court issued a statement of decision. The court found: \u201cThe record of\nconviction, including Petitioner\u2019s own testimony before the jury in this case conclusively\nshows that petitioner was the actual killer. [\u00b6] As the actual killer, petitioner would be\nguilty of murder under the current law and is ineligible for resentencing under Section\n1172.6.\u201d\n\n\n              PROCEDURE AND STANDARDS UNDER SECTION 1172.6\n               By legislation effective January 1, 2019, the Legislature amended the\nfelony-murder rule and eliminated the natural and probable consequences doctrine of\nliability as a basis for a murder conviction. (Stats, 2018, ch. 1015, \u00a7 2; see People v.\nReyes (2023) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Cal.5th 981</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984.) The latter result was accomplished by amending\nsection 188 to provide that, except in cases of felony murder, \u201cin order to be convicted of\nmurder, a principal in a crime shall act with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 188, subd. (a)(3).)\n              To obtain relief under section 1172.6, a petitioner must file in the\nsentencing court a petition alleging these three conditions have been met: (1) the\npetitioner was convicted based on a pleading \u201cthat allowed the prosecution to proceed\nunder a theory of felony murder, murder under the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine or other theory under which malice is imputed to a person based solely on that\nperson\u2019s participation in a crime\u201d (\u00a7 1172.6, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the petitioner was\nconvicted of murder or attempted murder (id., subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the petitioner could\nnot now be convicted of murder or attempted murder as those offenses are presently\ndefined (id., subd. (a)(3)).\n              If the petition satisfies certain technical requirements, then the trial court\nappoints counsel if the petitioner has requested counsel. (\u00a7 1176.2, subd. (b)(3).) Next,\n\u201cthe prosecutor shall file and serve a response,\u201d and \u201c[t]he petitioner may file and serve a\n\n                                              7\n\freply within 30 days after the prosecutor\u2019s response is served.\u201d (Id., subd. (c).) Once\nbriefing is completed, the trial court determines whether the petitioner has made a prima\nfacie case for relief. (Ibid.) If the court finds the petitioner has made a prima facie case,\nthen the court must issue an order to show cause. (Ibid.)\n                 In determining whether the petitioner has made a prima facie case for relief\nunder section 1172.6, the trial court\u2019s inquiry is limited: The court, accepting the\npetition\u2019s factual allegations as true, makes a \u201c\u2018\u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d\u2019\u201d whether the\npetitioner would be entitled to relief if those allegations were proven. (People v. Lewis\n(2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 Cal.5th 952</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971 (Lewis).) \u201c\u2018\u201cIf so, the court must issue an order to show\ncause.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Ibid.) Within 60 days of issuance of the order to show cause, the trial court\nmust hold a hearing to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to relief. (\u00a71172.6,\nsubd. (d)(1).)\n                 If counsel is appointed and the parties are given the opportunity for\nbriefing, the trial court may rely on the record of conviction to determine whether the\npetitioner has made a prima facie case for relief under section 1172.6. (Lewis, supra, 11\nCal.5th at p. 957.) \u201cThe record of conviction may include the underlying facts as\npresented in an appellate opinion, the trial evidence, the jury instructions, and closing\narguments of counsel.\u201d (People v. Lopez (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">78 Cal.App.5th 1</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13.) \u201cThe record of\nconviction will necessarily inform the trial court\u2019s prima facie inquiry under section\n[1172.6], allowing the court to distinguish petitions with potential merit from those that\nare clearly meritless.\u201d (Lewis, at p. 971.) \u201cIn sum, the parties can, and should, use the\nrecord of conviction to aid the trial court in reliably assessing whether a petitioner has\nmade a prima facie case for relief under subdivision (c) [of section 1172.6].\u201d (Id. at p.\n972.)\n                 \u201cIn reviewing any part of the record of conviction at this preliminary\njuncture, a trial court should not engage in \u2018factfinding involving the weighing of\nevidence or the exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 972.) \u201cWhile the\n\n                                                8\n\ftrial court may look at the record of conviction after the appointment of counsel to\ndetermine whether a petitioner has made a prima facie case for section [1172.6] relief, the\nprima facie inquiry under subdivision (c) is limited. Like the analogous prima facie\ninquiry in habeas corpus proceedings, \u2018\u201cthe court takes petitioner\u2019s factual allegations as\ntrue and makes a preliminary assessment regarding whether the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief if his or her factual allegations were proved. If so, the court must issue\nan order to show cause.\u201d\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018[A] court should not reject the petitioner\u2019s factual\nallegations on credibility grounds without first conducting an evidentiary hearing.\u2019\n[Citations.] \u2018However, if the record, including the court\u2019s own documents, \u201ccontain[s]\nfacts refuting the allegations made in the petition,\u201d then \u201cthe court is justified in making a\ncredibility determination adverse to the petitioner.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 971.)\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\nI. Standard of Review and Standard for Denying Relief Under Section 1172.6\n              The trial court denied defendant\u2019s resentencing petition on the ground\ndefendant had failed to make a prima facie case for resentencing relief. Denial of a\nresentencing petition at the prima facie stage is warranted only if the record of conviction\ndemonstrates the petitioner is ineligible for relief as a matter of law. (People v. Lopez,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.) That is a purely legal conclusion subject de novo review.\n(Ibid.)\n              \u201cA petitioner is ineligible for resentencing as a matter of law if the record\nof conviction conclusively establishes, with no factfinding, weighing of evidence, or\ncredibility determinations, that (1) the petitioner was the actual killer, or (2) the petitioner\nwas not the actual killer, but, with the intent to kill, aided, abetted, counseled,\ncommanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer in the commission\nof murder in the first degree, (3) the petitioner was a major participant in the underlying\nfelony and acted with reckless indifference to human life, or (4) the petitioner acted with\n\n                                               9\n\fmalice aforethought that was not imputed based solely on participation in a crime.\u201d\n(People v. Lopez, supra, 78 Cal.App.5th at p. 14.)\n\n\nII. Tapia Is Entitled to an Evidentiary Hearing\n              Tapia argues he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his resentencing\npetition because the record of conviction does not conclusively establish as a matter of\nlaw that he is ineligible for relief. Although Tapia testified he had stabbed Arroyo, Tapia\nargues that one or more of the jurors might have disbelieved that testimony, as well as his\ntestimony that he was not threatened by any codefendant, and found him liable under a\nnow impermissible theory, in particular, the natural and probable consequences doctrine.\nTapia contends the trial court engaged in factfinding by finding that he was the actual\nkiller.\n              We agree that the record of conviction does not conclusively establish that\nTapia is ineligible for relief. The jurors, who were instructed that they were \u201cthe sole\njudges of the believability of a witness,\u201d might have disbelieved Tapia\u2019s testimony. The\nprosecutor left open the possibility that Tapia was not the stabber. In closing, the\nprosecutor argued, \u201c[I]f you believe, as jurors, that one of the defendants was the stabber,\nwhich the evidence obviously shows, in fact, Mr. Tapia admitted being the stabber, but as\nyou will see when I go through the law dealing with group liability, which is the\nuncharged conspiracy or aiding and abetting, either of those theories, that the law holds\nall five defendants accountable even though only one of those defendants may be the\nstabber. The prosecutor also told the jury, \u201cWhoever the stabber was, whether you\nbelieve it was Mr. Tapia, as he said, or it\u2019s one of the other defendants, that person\nclearly acted with the express intent to kill.\u201d (Italics added.)\n              The jury\u2019s true finding on the knife-use enhancement does not conclusively\nestablish that Tapia was the stabber. The jury was instructed on personal use of a deadly\nor dangerous weapon and in that instruction was told \u201cthe term \u2018personally used a deadly\n\n                                              10\n\for dangerous weapon,\u2019 as used in this instruction, means the defendant must have\nintentionally displayed a weapon in a menacing manner or intentionally fired it or\nintentionally struck or hit a human being with it.\u201d That instruction did not require the\njury to find that Tapia stabbed Arroyo and killed him in order to return a true finding.\nIndeed, the verdict returned by the jury did not even find that Tapia had used a knife in\nthe commission of the murder: The verdict on the dangerous weapon enhancement states\nonly that the jury found that Tapia \u201cpersonally used a deadly or dangerous weapon,\nto-wit: KNIFE, at the time of the commission of the offense alleged in COUNT 1\n[murder].\u201d (Italics added.) The jury might have found that Tapia brandished the knife,\ndelivered the nonfatal stabs, or used the knife for a purpose unrelated to the murder at the\ntime the offense was committed.\n              At trial, the prosecutor argued strenuously that all defendants were guilty of\nmurder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. Without factfinding, the\nrecord does not foreclose the possibility that Tapia was convicted under that doctrine.\n              Given the record of conviction, and Tapia\u2019s testimony in particular, it might\nseem unlikely that the jury found anybody other than Tapia to be the actual killer.\nTapia\u2019s trial testimony, if believed, would be substantial evidence that Tapia was in fact\nthe actual killer. But such a credibility determination would be inappropriate at the prima\nfacie stage because the record does not positively refute the allegations of Tapia\u2019s\nresentencing petition. (Lewis, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 971.) At the prima facie stage, the\nstandard is that the record of conviction must conclusively establish that Tapia is\nineligible for relief as a matter of law. We cannot say it does. An evidentiary hearing is\ntherefore in order.\n              Our opinion should not be read as indicating whether the trial court should\ngrant or deny Tapia resentencing relief. Exercising de novo review, we conclude only\nthat Tapia has met his burden of making a prima facie case for relief under section\n1172.6, subdivision (c).\n\n                                             11\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n              The postjudgment order is reversed and the matter is remanded with\ndirections to the trial court to issue an order to show cause and conduct an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n\n                                                 SANCHEZ, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nBEDSWORTH, ACTING P.

Plaintiff then turned to her left and walked\ntoward the rest rooms located down a hallway near a side door\nentrance to the restaurant. As she approached the women\u2019s rest\nroom at approximately 7:24 p.m., Plaintiff slipped and fell on the\nfloor between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s rest rooms. Plaintiff\nscreamed.\n       Plaintiff does not know what caused her to slip and fall.\nThe hallway had adequate lighting that night. While on the floor\nafter her fall, Plaintiff did not see anything that she believed\nmade her fall. Plaintiff never advised Defendant\u2019s employees of\nany substance on the floor that she believed had caused her to\nslip.\n       At approximately 7:22 p.m., two minutes prior to Plaintiff\u2019s\nfall, Oscar Hernandez, the restaurant\u2019s assistant manager, made\nhis way to the men\u2019s rest room. En route, Hernandez inspected\nthe hallway floor outside the men\u2019s and women\u2019s rest rooms.\nHernandez saw no liquids, debris, or foreign substances on the\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\ffloor. If he had, Hernandez would have instructed another\nemployee to clean up such materials, or would have immediately\ndone so himself.\n       Two minutes after entering the men\u2019s rest room,\nHernandez heard screams and exited to find Plaintiff on the\nhallway floor he had just inspected. Hernandez saw no liquids,\ndebris, or foreign substance on the floor where Plaintiff fell.\n       No surveillance video footage was produced showing the\nhallway outside the rest rooms where Plaintiff fell on the night of\nMarch 6, 2019. Both parties produced still photographs from\nsurveillance videos and the surveillance videos depicting the area\nimmediately inside both the main entrance and the side door. 1\nThe still photographs were time and date stamped from 7:14 p.m.\nto 8:43 p.m. that night.\nII.    Procedural Background\n       In November 2020, Plaintiff sued Defendant for premises\nliability. Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that while in the\nDefendant\u2019s restaurant, she \u201cslipped and fell on a slippery\nsubstance\u201d and was injured due to Defendant\u2019s negligence.\n       Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing there\nwere no triable issues of material fact that prior to Plaintiff\u2019s slip\nand fall, Defendant had no actual notice of any dangerous\ncondition on the hallway floor and had no reasonable time to\ndiscover and correct any such hazard. The motion was supported\nby a declaration from Hernandez, the surveillance videos and still\nphotographs, and excerpts from Plaintiff\u2019s deposition.\n\n\n      1 The CD\u2019s of the surveillance videos are not part of the\nrecord on appeal and the Internet link to them has expired.\nHowever, the still photographs are part of the record.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f       Along with her opposition, Plaintiff submitted a declaration\nby a \u201csafety and liability expert,\u201d Eris J. Barillas (Barillas), who\nopined that \u201cDefendant\u2019s failure to properly maintain the walking\nsurfaces in the dining room in combination with Defendant\u2019s\npractice of allowing trash to accumulate and overflow from the\ntrash receptacles onto the floor, thereby contaminating the floor\nsurface, was the cause of Plaintiff\u2019s fall and resultant injuries.\u201d\nThe declaration was accompanied by the still photographs from\nthe restaurant\u2019s surveillance videos. Additional Plaintiff\u2019s\nexhibits were excerpts of Hernandez\u2019s and Plaintiff\u2019s depositions.\nPlaintiff also filed evidentiary objections to Hernandez\u2019s\ndeclaration.\n       Defendant filed a reply and evidentiary objections to the\ndeclaration of Plaintiff\u2019s expert.\n       Following a hearing, the trial court granted Defendant\nsummary judgment. Citing Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26\nCal.4th 1200 (Ortega) and Girvetz v. Boys\u2019 Market, Inc. (1949) 91\nCal.App.2d 827, the court explained Defendant could be liable for\npremises liability only if the restaurant had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d\nof the \u201calleged dangerous condition.\u201d The court ruled there were\nno triable issues of material fact as to whether the restaurant\nhad constructive notice of any liquids, debris or foreign\nsubstances on the floor because it was undisputed that\nHernandez had inspected the hallway area between the rest\nrooms just two minutes before Plaintiff\u2019s slip and fall. \u201cA period\nof two minutes is too short of a time to require Defendant to have\ndiscovered the condition and remedied it, and thus to establish\nconstructive notice.\u201d\n       Following the entry of judgment, Plaintiff filed this timely\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f                            DISCUSSION\nI.     Trial Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings Were Partially\nIncorrect, but Harmless\n       As a threshold matter, Plaintiff contends the trial court\nerroneously excluded portions of the declaration of Plaintiff\u2019s\nexpert, Barillas. Although the standard of review for evidentiary\nrulings on summary judgment has yet to be settled by our\nSupreme Court, we side with the majority rule and review such\nrulings for an abuse of discretion. (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2023)\n87 Cal.App.5th 939, 946 & fn. 3.)\n       The trial court excluded two categories of information set\nforth in Barillas\u2019s declaration\u2014namely, (1) Barillas\u2019s recounting\nof Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony that Plaintiff saw an \u201coily\ncontaminant\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d on the floor when she fell, on the\ngrounds that this recounting ran afoul of People v. Sanchez (2016)\n63 Cal.4th 665 (Sanchez) and (2) five other portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration, on unspecified grounds. Because Plaintiff did not\nask the trial court to clarify the grounds for excluding the second\ncategory of statements, and because Plaintiff mistakenly argues\non appeal that they were excluded on Sanchez grounds, only the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling on the first category is properly before us on\nappeal.\n       The trial court erred in excluding the portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration that merely recounted Plaintiff\u2019s deposition\ntestimony, but that error was harmless. Sanchez provides that\nan expert may rely on inadmissible hearsay in forming an\nopinion, but may not relay that hearsay unless it is otherwise\nadmissible in evidence. (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 685\u2013\n686.) Although a party\u2019s deposition testimony admitted for its\ntruth constitutes hearsay when offered by that party at trial, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fnot hearsay when offered by that party on a motion for summary\njudgment\u2014where a party\u2019s deposition functions as their in-court\ntestimony. (E.g., Guthrey v. State of California (1998) 63\nCal.App.4th 1108, 1119\u20131120.) Thus, Barillas\u2019s recitation of\nPlaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony did not run afoul of Sanchez. As\nexplained below, however, this error was harmless because\nneither Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony nor Barillas\u2019s expert\nopinion relying upon that testimony creates a triable issue of fact\nas to whether Defendant had constructive notice of the substance\nPlaintiff saw on the ground.\nII.   Summary Judgment Law\n      Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no triable\nissues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c);\nRegents of University of California v. Superior Court (2018) 4\nCal.5th 607, 618.) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018 \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision\nde novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and\nopposing papers except that to which objections were made and\nsustained.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We liberally construe the evidence in\nsupport of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve\ndoubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Hampton v. County of San Diego (2015) 62 Cal.4th 340, 347.)\n      A defendant moving for summary judgment has the initial\nburden of presenting evidence that a cause of action lacks merit\nbecause the plaintiff cannot establish an element of the cause of\naction or there is a complete defense. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th\n826, 853.) If the defendant satisfies this initial burden, the\nburden shifts to the plaintiff to present evidence demonstrating\n\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fthere is a triable issue of material fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar, at p. 850.)\n III. Premises Liability Law\n       The elements of a premises liability claim are the same as\nthose of a negligence claim: \u201ca legal duty of care, breach of that\nduty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.\u201d (Kesner v.\nSuperior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158.) \u201c[L]andowners are\nrequired \u2018to maintain land in their possession and control in a\nreasonably safe condition\u2019 [citation], and to use due care to\neliminate dangerous conditions on their property.\u201d (Taylor v.\nTrimble (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 934, 943\u2013944; accord, Ortega,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205 [\u201cIt is well established in California\nthat although a store owner is not an insurer of the safety of its\npatrons, the owner does owe them a duty to exercise reasonable\ncare in keeping the premises reasonably safe\u201d].) \u201cA store owner\nexercises ordinary care by making reasonable inspections of the\nportions of the premises open to customers, and the care required\nis commensurate with the risks involved.\u201d (Ortega, at p. 1205.)\n       \u201c \u2018On the issue of the fact of causation, as on other issues\nessential to the cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff, in\ngeneral, has the burden of proof. The plaintiff must introduce\nevidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that\nit is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a\ncause in fact of the result. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] In the context of a\nbusiness owner\u2019s liability to a customer or invitee, speculation,\nand conjecture with respect to how long a dangerous condition\nhas existed are insufficient to satisfy a plaintiff's burden.\u201d\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at pp. 1205\u20131206; accord, Peralta v.\nThe Vons Companies, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1030, 1035.)\n\u201cBecause the owner is not the insurer of the visitor\u2019s personal\n\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fsafety [citation], the owner\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of\nthe dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability.\u201d\n(Ortega, at p. 1206; accord, Peralta, at p. 1035; Girvetz v. Boys\u2019\nMarket, Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.2d at p. 829 [a store owner is \u201cnot\nan insurer of the safety of [its] patrons\u201d].) Moreover, \u201cwhere the\nplaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to\nprove the owner\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of\nshowing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time\nto correct it.\u201d (Ortega, at p. 1206.)\n       Where, as here, there is \u201cno evidence of the source of the\ndangerous condition or the length of time it existed,\u201d a store\nowner\u2019s \u201cfailure to inspect the premises within a reasonable\nperiod of time\u201d creates an \u201cinference that the defective condition\nexisted long enough for a reasonable person exercising ordinary\ncare\u201d to have constructive notice of that condition (which, in turn,\nconstitutes evidence that the owner breached its duty of care).\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1203; Moore v. Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 472, 477.) What is a \u201creasonable\nperiod of time\u201d depends on the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d of each\ncase. (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1207.)\nIV. No Triable Issue of Fact as to Constructive Notice\n       A.     Defendant\u2019s Initial Burden\n       We independently agree with the trial court that Defendant\ncarried its initial burden of establishing the restaurant had no\nconstructive notice of any liquids, debris, or foreign substances on\nthe floor where Plaintiff fell, and thus did not breach its duty of\ncare to Plaintiff. No one knew the origin of any substance that\nPlaintiff claimed had caused her to slip and fall. Nor did anyone\nknow how the purported substance was transported there.\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f       Although Barillas\u2019s acknowledged these facts in her\ndeclaration, she nonetheless suggested\u2014in the admissible\nportions of her declaration\u2014that the incident was caused by\noverflowing trash receptacles inside the main entrance and food\nspilled on the floor that Plaintiff had traversed. As the trial court\ndetermined, the theory that Plaintiff\u2019s fall was caused by debris\non the floor is speculative. None of the accompanying\nphotographs on which Barillas relies show the trash cans were\noverflowing or there was trash or food on the floor where Plaintiff\nwas seen walking. (Garibay v. Hemmat (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th\n735, 743 [expert opinions based on assumptions of fact with no\nevidentiary support are speculative and without evidentiary\nvalue and do not raise triable issues of fact]; Sanchez v. Kern\nEmergency Medical Transportation Corp. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th\n146, 155 [same].) Barillas\u2019s speculative opinion presents no\ntriable issue of fact.\n       More importantly, it is uncontroverted that Hernandez had\ninspected the very area in this case just two minutes before\nPlaintiff\u2019s slip and fall, which satisfies Defendant\u2019s initial burden:\nWhere a \u201cstore owner has taken care in the discharge of its duty[]\nby inspecting its premises in a reasonable manner, then no\nbreach will be found even if a plaintiff does suffer injury.\u201d\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1211.) This means the trial court\nproperly found Plaintiff\u2019s attack on Hernandez\u2019s credibility has\nno bearing on whether summary judgment is to be granted.\n\u201c[S]ummary judgment shall not be denied on grounds of\ncredibility.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7437c, subd. (e); Binder v. Aetna\nLife Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840 [\u201cThe trial court may\nnot weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact finder to\ndetermine whose version is more likely true. [Citation.] Nor may\n\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\fthe trial court grant summary judgment based on the court\u2019s\nevaluation of credibility\u201d].) Plaintiff\u2019s assertion to the contrary,\nthe court properly referenced and applied this rule of law.\nPlaintiff\u2019s challenge to Hernandez\u2019s credibility raises no triable\nissue of fact.\n       On de novo review, we also agree with the trial court\u2019s\nfinding that Hernandez\u2019s inspection of the area two minutes\nbefore Plaintiff\u2019s fall, combined with Plaintiff\u2019s testimony of not\nseeing anything on the floor before she fell negate an inference a\ndangerous condition existed long enough for the restaurant to\nreasonably discover it. (See Peralta, supra, 24 Cal.App.5th at p.\n1037 [trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of\nstore where clerk\u2019s sweep was recorded fewer than eight minutes\nbefore the plaintiff\u2019s fall, clerk did not see anything in his sweep,\nand the plaintiff admitted she did not see any substance on the\nfloor before or after her fall]; Girvetz v. Boys\u2019 Market, Inc., supra,\n91 Cal.App.2d at p. 831 [customer\u2019s fall on banana peel\nremaining on the floor for one-and-a-half minutes was\ninsufficient time for constructive notice].) Plaintiff did not\nestablish a triable issue of fact as to constructive notice.\nB.     Plaintiff\u2019s Consequent Burden\n       Plaintiff offers three arguments in response. First, the trial\ncourt \u201cshould have applied the holding in Scott v. Alpha Beta Co.\n(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 305, 310\u2013311 (Scott), a comparative\nnegligence case. In Scott, a store customer brought an action for\nnegligence alleging rainwater tracked onto a slippery interior\nfloor mat caused her to fall. (Id. at pp. 306\u2013307.) There was\nevidence the owner had sufficient notice of the dangerous\ncondition of the property. The owner knew it was raining, knew\ninvitees would be continuously entering the building while it was\n\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fraining and would track water onto the floor, and knew the floor\nwas slippery when wet and the mat collected water. (Id. at pp.\n307\u2013308.) There was also evidence the customer had failed to\nexercise due care for her safety. The customer had a \u201ctrick knee,\u201d\nwhich may have given out and caused her to fall, she wore house\nslippers into the store and might be expected to know the slippers\nwould remain wet when she reached the end of the floor mat, and\nshe took no special precautions in stepping from the mat to the\nfloor. (Id. at p. 310.)\n       A jury found the store 60 percent negligent and the\ncustomer 40 percent negligent. (Scott, supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at\np. 306.) Both parties appealed, and the judgment was affirmed.\n(Id. at p. 311.) Scott is of no assistance to Plaintiff for many\nreasons. Chief among them is, unlike this case, the origin and\nnature of the dangerous condition\u2014a steady stream of rainwater\non an already slippery floor and wet floor mat\u2014was clearly\nknown to the store. Here, neither the source nor location of the\nalleged substance was known to anyone before Plaintiff fell. This\ndistinction is made more obvious by Plaintiff\u2019s changing claims as\nto the nature of that substance\u2014trash or rainwater. We cannot\ninfer the existence of evidence from the absence of evidence.\n       Plaintiff further argues the question of causation is\ntypically one for the jury (Kaney v. Custance (2022) 74\nCal.App.5th 201, 212), thus rendering it inappropriate to grant\nsummary judgment. This is true. However, it is ultimately\nirrelevant where, as here, causation cannot be established by\nnonspeculative evidence (see Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 774), and there is no triable issue of fact as\nto the lack of constructive notice. Summary judgment is still\nappropriate where the \u201cfacts . . . are undisputed\u201d or where\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\freasonable minds can come to but one conclusion. (Ortega,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205.)\n       Finally, Plaintiff urges that the trial court erred in not\napplying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Because Plaintiff\nfailed to present, develop, and advance her legal argument\nregarding res ipsa loquitur before the trial court, she has forfeited\nthat argument on appeal. (See Bently Reserve LP v. Papaliolios\n(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 418, 435\u2013436 [failure to sufficiently raise\nan issue before trial court forfeits the issue on appeal]; Roman v.\nBRE Properties, Inc.

The trial court granted\nDefendant summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed. We conclude\nthe error in one of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings was\nharmless, and there were no triable issues of fact as to\nDefendant\u2019s liability. We affirm.\n       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nI.     Facts\n       At approximately 7:23 p.m. on March 6, 2019, Plaintiff\nwalked through the main entrance of the restaurant to purchase\nsome dinner to take home. It had been raining that day. Just\ninside the main entrance, Plaintiff wiped her shoes on a rubber\n\u201canti-slip\u201d floor mat. Plaintiff then turned to her left and walked\ntoward the rest rooms located down a hallway near a side door\nentrance to the restaurant. As she approached the women\u2019s rest\nroom at approximately 7:24 p.m., Plaintiff slipped and fell on the\nfloor between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s rest rooms. Plaintiff\nscreamed.\n       Plaintiff does not know what caused her to slip and fall.\nThe hallway had adequate lighting that night. While on the floor\nafter her fall, Plaintiff did not see anything that she believed\nmade her fall. Plaintiff never advised Defendant\u2019s employees of\nany substance on the floor that she believed had caused her to\nslip.\n       At approximately 7:22 p.m., two minutes prior to Plaintiff\u2019s\nfall, Oscar Hernandez, the restaurant\u2019s assistant manager, made\nhis way to the men\u2019s rest room. En route, Hernandez inspected\nthe hallway floor outside the men\u2019s and women\u2019s rest rooms.\nHernandez saw no liquids, debris, or foreign substances on the\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\ffloor. If he had, Hernandez would have instructed another\nemployee to clean up such materials, or would have immediately\ndone so himself.\n       Two minutes after entering the men\u2019s rest room,\nHernandez heard screams and exited to find Plaintiff on the\nhallway floor he had just inspected. Hernandez saw no liquids,\ndebris, or foreign substance on the floor where Plaintiff fell.\n       No surveillance video footage was produced showing the\nhallway outside the rest rooms where Plaintiff fell on the night of\nMarch 6, 2019. Both parties produced still photographs from\nsurveillance videos and the surveillance videos depicting the area\nimmediately inside both the main entrance and the side door. 1\nThe still photographs were time and date stamped from 7:14 p.m.\nto 8:43 p.m. that night.\nII.    Procedural Background\n       In November 2020, Plaintiff sued Defendant for premises\nliability. Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that while in the\nDefendant\u2019s restaurant, she \u201cslipped and fell on a slippery\nsubstance\u201d and was injured due to Defendant\u2019s negligence.\n       Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing there\nwere no triable issues of material fact that prior to Plaintiff\u2019s slip\nand fall, Defendant had no actual notice of any dangerous\ncondition on the hallway floor and had no reasonable time to\ndiscover and correct any such hazard. The motion was supported\nby a declaration from Hernandez, the surveillance videos and still\nphotographs, and excerpts from Plaintiff\u2019s deposition.\n\n\n      1 The CD\u2019s of the surveillance videos are not part of the\nrecord on appeal and the Internet link to them has expired.\nHowever, the still photographs are part of the record.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f       Along with her opposition, Plaintiff submitted a declaration\nby a \u201csafety and liability expert,\u201d Eris J. Barillas (Barillas), who\nopined that \u201cDefendant\u2019s failure to properly maintain the walking\nsurfaces in the dining room in combination with Defendant\u2019s\npractice of allowing trash to accumulate and overflow from the\ntrash receptacles onto the floor, thereby contaminating the floor\nsurface, was the cause of Plaintiff\u2019s fall and resultant injuries.\u201d\nThe declaration was accompanied by the still photographs from\nthe restaurant\u2019s surveillance videos. Additional Plaintiff\u2019s\nexhibits were excerpts of Hernandez\u2019s and Plaintiff\u2019s depositions.\nPlaintiff also filed evidentiary objections to Hernandez\u2019s\ndeclaration.\n       Defendant filed a reply and evidentiary objections to the\ndeclaration of Plaintiff\u2019s expert.\n       Following a hearing, the trial court granted Defendant\nsummary judgment.

Trial Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings Were Partially\nIncorrect, but Harmless\n       As a threshold matter, Plaintiff contends the trial court\nerroneously excluded portions of the declaration of Plaintiff\u2019s\nexpert, Barillas. Although the standard of review for evidentiary\nrulings on summary judgment has yet to be settled by our\nSupreme Court, we side with the majority rule and review such\nrulings for an abuse of discretion. (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2023)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">87 Cal.App.5th 939</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 946 &amp; fn. 3.)\n       The trial court excluded two categories of information set\nforth in Barillas\u2019s declaration\u2014namely, (1) Barillas\u2019s recounting\nof Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony that Plaintiff saw an \u201coily\ncontaminant\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d on the floor when she fell, on the\ngrounds that this recounting ran afoul of People v. Sanchez (2016)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3219008\"><a href=\"/opinion/3219114/people-v-sanchez/\">63 Cal.4th 665</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Sanchez) and (2) five other portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration, on unspecified grounds. Because Plaintiff did not\nask the trial court to clarify the grounds for excluding the second\ncategory of statements, and because Plaintiff mistakenly argues\non appeal that they were excluded on Sanchez grounds, only the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling on the first category is properly before us on\nappeal.\n       The trial court erred in excluding the portions of Barillas\u2019s\ndeclaration that merely recounted Plaintiff\u2019s deposition\ntestimony, but that error was harmless. Sanchez provides that\nan expert may rely on inadmissible hearsay in forming an\nopinion, but may not relay that hearsay unless it is otherwise\nadmissible in evidence. (Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3219008\"><a href=\"/opinion/3219114/people-v-sanchez/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 63 Cal.4th at pp. 685\u2013\n686.) Although a party\u2019s deposition testimony admitted for its\ntruth constitutes hearsay when offered by that party at trial, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fnot hearsay when offered by that party on a motion for summary\njudgment\u2014where a party\u2019s deposition functions as their in-court\ntestimony. (E.g., Guthrey v. State of California (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252309\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252309/guthrey-v-state-of-california/\">63\nCal.App.4th 1108</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119\u20131120.) Thus, Barillas\u2019s recitation of\nPlaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony did not run afoul of Sanchez. As\nexplained below, however, this error was harmless because\nneither Plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony nor Barillas\u2019s expert\nopinion relying upon that testimony creates a triable issue of fact\nas to whether Defendant had constructive notice of the substance\nPlaintiff saw on the ground.\nII.   Summary Judgment Law\n      Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no triable\nissues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ.

(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.

Moreover, \u201cwhere the\nplaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to\nprove the owner\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of\nshowing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time\nto correct it.\u201d (Ortega, at p. 1206.)\n       Where, as here, there is \u201cno evidence of the source of the\ndangerous condition or the length of time it existed,\u201d a store\nowner\u2019s \u201cfailure to inspect the premises within a reasonable\nperiod of time\u201d creates an \u201cinference that the defective condition\nexisted long enough for a reasonable person exercising ordinary\ncare\u201d to have constructive notice of that condition (which, in turn,\nconstitutes evidence that the owner breached its duty of care).\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1203; Moore v.

No Triable Issue of Fact as to Constructive Notice\n       A.     Defendant\u2019s Initial Burden\n       We independently agree with the trial court that Defendant\ncarried its initial burden of establishing the restaurant had no\nconstructive notice of any liquids, debris, or foreign substances on\nthe floor where Plaintiff fell, and thus did not breach its duty of\ncare to Plaintiff. No one knew the origin of any substance that\nPlaintiff claimed had caused her to slip and fall. Nor did anyone\nknow how the purported substance was transported there.\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f       Although Barillas\u2019s acknowledged these facts in her\ndeclaration, she nonetheless suggested\u2014in the admissible\nportions of her declaration\u2014that the incident was caused by\noverflowing trash receptacles inside the main entrance and food\nspilled on the floor that Plaintiff had traversed. As the trial court\ndetermined, the theory that Plaintiff\u2019s fall was caused by debris\non the floor is speculative. None of the accompanying\nphotographs on which Barillas relies show the trash cans were\noverflowing or there was trash or food on the floor where Plaintiff\nwas seen walking. (Garibay v. Hemmat (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">161 Cal.App.4th\n735</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743 [expert opinions based on assumptions of fact with no\nevidentiary support are speculative and without evidentiary\nvalue and do not raise triable issues of fact]; Sanchez v.

Barillas\u2019s speculative opinion presents no\ntriable issue of fact.\n       More importantly, it is uncontroverted that Hernandez had\ninspected the very area in this case just two minutes before\nPlaintiff\u2019s slip and fall, which satisfies Defendant\u2019s initial burden:\nWhere a \u201cstore owner has taken care in the discharge of its duty[]\nby inspecting its premises in a reasonable manner, then no\nbreach will be found even if a plaintiff does suffer injury.\u201d\n(Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1211.) This means the trial court\nproperly found Plaintiff\u2019s attack on Hernandez\u2019s credibility has\nno bearing on whether summary judgment is to be granted.\n\u201c[S]ummary judgment shall not be denied on grounds of\ncredibility.\u201d (Code Civ.

Plaintiff\u2019s assertion to the contrary,\nthe court properly referenced and applied this rule of law.\nPlaintiff\u2019s challenge to Hernandez\u2019s credibility raises no triable\nissue of fact.\n       On de novo review, we also agree with the trial court\u2019s\nfinding that Hernandez\u2019s inspection of the area two minutes\nbefore Plaintiff\u2019s fall, combined with Plaintiff\u2019s testimony of not\nseeing anything on the floor before she fell negate an inference a\ndangerous condition existed long enough for the restaurant to\nreasonably discover it.

Plaintiff did not\nestablish a triable issue of fact as to constructive notice.\nB.     Plaintiff\u2019s Consequent Burden\n       Plaintiff offers three arguments in response. First, the trial\ncourt \u201cshould have applied the holding in Scott v. Alpha Beta Co.\n(1980) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">104 Cal.App.3d 305</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310\u2013311 (Scott), a comparative\nnegligence case. In Scott, a store customer brought an action for\nnegligence alleging rainwater tracked onto a slippery interior\nfloor mat caused her to fall. (Id. at pp. 306\u2013307.) There was\nevidence the owner had sufficient notice of the dangerous\ncondition of the property. The owner knew it was raining, knew\ninvitees would be continuously entering the building while it was\n\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fraining and would track water onto the floor, and knew the floor\nwas slippery when wet and the mat collected water. (Id. at pp.\n307\u2013308.) There was also evidence the customer had failed to\nexercise due care for her safety. The customer had a \u201ctrick knee,\u201d\nwhich may have given out and caused her to fall, she wore house\nslippers into the store and might be expected to know the slippers\nwould remain wet when she reached the end of the floor mat, and\nshe took no special precautions in stepping from the mat to the\nfloor. (Id. at p. 310.)\n       A jury found the store 60 percent negligent and the\ncustomer 40 percent negligent. (Scott, supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at\np. 306.) Both parties appealed, and the judgment was affirmed.\n(Id. at p. 311.) Scott is of no assistance to Plaintiff for many\nreasons. Chief among them is, unlike this case, the origin and\nnature of the dangerous condition\u2014a steady stream of rainwater\non an already slippery floor and wet floor mat\u2014was clearly\nknown to the store. Here, neither the source nor location of the\nalleged substance was known to anyone before Plaintiff fell. This\ndistinction is made more obvious by Plaintiff\u2019s changing claims as\nto the nature of that substance\u2014trash or rainwater. We cannot\ninfer the existence of evidence from the absence of evidence.\n       Plaintiff further argues the question of causation is\ntypically one for the jury (Kaney v. Custance (2022) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">74\nCal.App.5th 201</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212), thus rendering it inappropriate to grant\nsummary judgment. This is true. However, it is ultimately\nirrelevant where, as here, causation cannot be established by\nnonspeculative evidence (see Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2582567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2582567/saelzler-v-advanced-group-400/\">25 Cal.4th 763</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774), and there is no triable issue of fact as\nto the lack of constructive notice. Summary judgment is still\nappropriate where the \u201cfacts . . . are undisputed\u201d or where\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\freasonable minds can come to but one conclusion. (Ortega,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5452366\"><a href=\"/opinion/5607973/ortega-v-kmart-corp/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 26 Cal.4th at p. 1205.)\n       Finally, Plaintiff urges that the trial court erred in not\napplying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Because Plaintiff\nfailed to present, develop, and advance her legal argument\nregarding res ipsa loquitur before the trial court, she has forfeited\nthat argument on appeal.

Schindler for Cross-\ndefendant and Appellant.\n         Ellenoff Grossman & Schole, Eric Neil Landau and Travis Biffar for\nCross-complainant and Respondent.\n\f      Jordan Blake Persky sued his former employer, Strata Equity Global,\n\nInc. (Strata) for employment-related claims.1 As the litigation was\nproceeding, counsel for Persky informed Strata that Persky had been able to\naccess at least one legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel regarding work related\nto Persky\u2019s lawsuit. Strata then filed a cross-complaint alleging that Persky\n\nhad violated Penal Code2 section 502, which prohibits unauthorized access to\ncomputers, computer systems, and computer networks, by allegedly accessing\nStrata\u2019s \u201ccomputer network and file databases\u201d and viewing and obtaining\ndata contained within them, including the legal invoice. Persky filed an anti-\nSLAPP motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16), asserting that the claims in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint arose from Persky\u2019s protected activity involving the\nlitigation between the parties. The trial court denied the motion, concluding\nthat Strata\u2019s cross-claims against Persky are based on unprotected activity.\nWe agree and affirm the court\u2019s order.\n\n              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.   The Complaint and Cross-complaint\n\n      In April 2022, Persky filed his complaint against Strata, a real estate\ninvesting firm, alleging breach of his employment agreement and related\nLabor Code claims. At the time he filed the lawsuit, Persky was employed as\nthe Managing Director of Finance, and he continued to work in that role as\nthe litigation proceeded.\n      At some point after filing this action, Persky accessed Strata\u2019s\naccounting records through its computer network. Relevant to this appeal,\n\n\n1     Melissa Frerichs, another Strata employee, also joined Persky as a\nplaintiff in the lawsuit against Strata, but she is not a party to this appeal.\n2     Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n                                         2\n\fPersky is alleged to have reviewed documents in a corporate management file\ndatabase, one of which was a legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel related to\nPersky\u2019s action. At the time, Persky did not advise Strata he had looked at\nthe invoice. In late May 2022, Persky\u2019s lawyer informed Strata\u2019s counsel that\nPersky had accessed a legal invoice.\n      In June 2022, Strata filed a cross-complaint against Persky, alleging a\nsingle cause of action for the violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data\nAccess and Fraud Act, codified at section 502 of the Penal Code based on\nPersky\u2019s accessing of Strata\u2019s computer network and electronic files stored\n\nthere.3 It specifically referenced as the basis for relief three subdivisions of\nsection 502: (c)(1)(B), (c)(2), and (c)(7). The cross-complaint sought\ncompensatory damages, which included \u201call expenditures to investigate\nStrata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd.\n(e)(1)), as well as punitive damages (id., subd. (e)(4)), attorney fees (id., subd.\n(e)(2)), and other unspecified injunctive or equitable relief \u201cas the Court\ndeems just and reasonable\u201d (id., subd. (e)(1)).\n\nB.   Persky\u2019s Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      Persky filed a special motion to strike the cross-complaint under Code\nof Civil Procedure section 425.16. He asserted that Strata\u2019s cause of action\nfor a violation of section 502 arose from his protected activity because the\n\u201cgravamen of Strata\u2019s claim is that Persky impermissibly accessed Strata\u2019s\nfiles to communicate documents to his attorneys so that he could gain a\nlitigation advantage.\u201d Persky further argued that the \u201cclaim is premised on\ncommunications by Persky\u2019s counsel to Strata\u2019s counsel relating to a legal\n\n\n3      Strata alleged that Persky \u201cnavigated five (5) layers of folders outside\nof his [employment] purview and job responsibilities in order to access the\nfolder containing [Strata\u2019s attorneys\u2019] legal invoice.\u201d\n                                         3\n\finvoice that Strata had improperly made available to Persky and other\nemployees.\u201d\n      Persky\u2019s motion principally relied on the allegations in paragraphs 12,\n13, 18, and 19 of the cross-complaint. These allegations are as follows:\n          \u201c[W]ithout authorization, Mr. Persky has been rummaging\n          through Strata Global\u2019s network and databases, including\n          its corporate management database, to obtain information\n          and documentation, such as legal invoices, which Mr.\n          Persky knows are outside his permitted access for use\n          against Strata Global in this litigation.\u201d\n\n          \u201cAfter four months, on May 25, 2022, Strata Global\u2019s\n          counsel finally was advised by counsel for Mr. Persky that\n          Mr. Persky had gained access to EGS\u2019s legal invoices on\n          Strata Global\u2019s shared company server. Strata Global is\n          informed and believes and thereon alleges that Mr. Persky\n          accessed at least one legal invoice and viewed its contents.\n          Mr. Persky\u2019s counsel thereafter provide the file path for the\n          folder that Mr. Persky accessed.\u201d\n\n          \u201c[F]rom December 2021 to present, Mr. Persky has\n          knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer network and\n          file databases impermissibly to access, download, copy, or\n          otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\n          the company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2),\n          and 502(c)(7) of the Penal Code, Cal. Pen. Code, \u00a7 502(c), et\n          seq.\u201d\n\n          \u201cMr. Persky knowingly and willfully accessed confidential\n          and privileged litigation documents, taking the contents\n          therein in violation of Section 502(c)(2) of the Penal Code,\n          with malice and to irreparably harm the case for the\n          defense in this litigation.\u201d\n\n      With respect to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Persky\nargued that the litigation privilege barred Strata\u2019s claim, making it\nimpossible for Strata to establish a probability of prevailing on its cause of\naction.\n                                        4\n\fC.   Strata\u2019s Opposition\n\n      In response to Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, Strata primarily argued\nthat the conduct by Persky forming the basis for its cross-complaint was not a\n\u201c \u2018written or oral statement or writing\u2019 \u201d in an official proceeding. Rather,\naccording to Strata, the conduct underlying its claims was Persky\u2019s\n\u201caccessing, viewing, and taking privileged and confidential data from Strata\nGlobal\u2019s network . . . , not his discussions with counsel.\u201d Strata specifically\ndisclaimed that the cross-complaint included any allegation founded on\nPersky\u2019s \u201cintention to communicate any stolen data to his attorneys,\u201d\ncontrary to Persky\u2019s argument otherwise.\n      Strata also asserted that, to the extent the burden was shifted to Strata\nto demonstrate its cross-complaint had minimal merit, it could show a\nprobability of success on the merits. Strata maintained that Persky\u2019s status\nas an employee of Strata at the time of the alleged unlawful access to the\ncomputer network and databases did not bar its claim under section 502 as a\nmatter of law. It also contended that the litigation privilege did not apply\nbecause its cross-complaint was \u201cnot premised on Mr. Persky\u2019s\ncommunication to his attorneys,\u201d but was instead \u201cpremised entirely on his\nconduct in illegally accessing\u201d Strata\u2019s computer network and files.\n      Strata filed the declaration of one of its attorneys of record, Eric\nLandau, who provided further definition for the factual basis of Strata\u2019s\ncross-claims. Landau stated that on May 25, 2022, he received an email from\nPersky\u2019s lawyer \u201cstating that one of his clients accessed a litigation invoice\nfrom [Strata\u2019s counsel of record] pertaining to this action on [Strata\u2019s]\nNetwork.\u201d Landau inquired as to which plaintiff had gained access and how\nthe access had been gained. Counsel indicated that Persky had accessed the\ninvoice through an \u201cAccounts Payable folder.\u201d Landau initiated an\n\n                                        5\n\finvestigation into the matter on Strata\u2019s behalf, which included interviews of\nrelevant Strata employees. Strata filed the cross-complaint against Persky\non the basis of its preliminary investigation, but at the time of the filing of\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, Strata\u2019s investigation was still \u201congoing,\u201d and it had\nhired a digital forensics expert to assist in the investigation. Landau\nindicated that individuals from his office had \u201cspent approximately 25 hours\u201d\ninvestigating the matter at the time of filing the opposition to Persky\u2019s anti-\nSLAPP motion.\n      Strata also submitted a declaration from Rezlyn Palma, its Chief\nAccounting Officer. Palma explained that Strata uses a \u201cshared folder\nsystem to save files for documents related to\u201d its corporate operations.\nTypically, Strata saves invoices and proof of payment as a single .pdf file,\nwhich is then saved in subfolders representing the month and year in which\nthe invoice was paid, which are themselves saved within subfolder after\nsubfolder, all of which are located within the general \u201cAccounting\u201d folder.\nThe invoice and proof of payment that Persky accessed had been saved in this\nmanner.\n      Finally, Strata submitted a declaration from David Thompson, a digital\nforensics investigator hired by Strata to investigate Persky\u2019s \u201ccomputer\nactivities . . . in the Strata Global network and company database.\u201d\nThompson \u201cwas able to determine to a reasonable degree of professional\ncertainty that\u201d Persky used his Strata desktop computer to \u201caccess[ ] and\nopen[ ]\u201d the .pdf document containing the legal invoice and proof of payment\nthat was stored on Strata\u2019s network. At the time Persky accessed the file, the\ninvoice and proof of payment had been saved \u201cwithin five layers of sub-\nfolders.\u201d Thompson indicated that he had spent more than 60 hours on his\ninvestigation, and that his rate was $350 per hour.\n\n\n                                        6\n\fD.   Hearing on the Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      The trial court provided the parties with a tentative ruling in which it\nindicated an intent to deny Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court noted\nthat the basis for Strata\u2019s sole cause of action was the allegation that \u201cPersky\nallegedly improperly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer data,\u201d and that any\nallegations about the type of data that was accessed, how that data may have\nbeen used, and/or with whom the data may have been shared was\ninformation that was not necessary for Strata to succeed on its cause of\naction.\n      At oral argument, counsel for Persky began by noting that Strata had\nset out three violations of section 502, under three different subdivisions of\nthe statute, and that each claim should be \u201cevaluated separately for purposes\nof the anti-SLAPP motion.\u201d Specifically, counsel noted that, at least with\nrespect to a claim for relief under subdivision (c)(1)(B), the provision requires\nthat the defendant \u201cdid something after\u201d accessing data\u2014that is, the\ndefendant must have \u201caltered, damaged, deleted, or otherwise uses the data.\u201d\nShe noted \u201cthere is not a single allegation of Mr. Persky altering, damaging,\ndeleting or destroying any data,\u201d and that the \u201conly allegation Strata submits\nto support its section 502(c)(1)(B) claim is Mr. Persky\u2019s use of that data in\nthis litigation.\u201d Counsel asserted that, as a result, the allegations in\nparagraphs 12, 18, and 19, as well as the claim for a violation of subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) must be stricken.\n      In response to the argument by Persky\u2019s attorney, counsel for Strata\nasserted that Persky\u2019s application of the allegations of the complaint to a\nclaim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1)(B) was based on a too-limited\nreading of that provision. Strata\u2019s attorney explained that if subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) \u201cended with \u2018or otherwise uses any data,\u2019 \u201d then Persky\u2019s contention\n\n                                        7\n\fmight have some validity. But the subdivision instead continues beyond the\nword \u201cdata,\u201d and \u201csays \u2018or otherwise uses any data, computer, computer\nsystem, or computer network.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he explained, \u201c[t]he\nword \u2018use\u2019 is not limited to the use of the data, . . . but [is] expanded to both\nthe data, a computer system, and a computer network.\u201d Because the usage\nreferred to in subdivision (c)(1) may be done with respect to a computer\nsystem or network, it was not necessary for Strata to meet the \u201cuse\u201d element\nwith an allegation as to how any particular data may have been used in the\ncontext of the litigation between the parties.\n      Persky\u2019s attorney responded with an argument related to one she had\nposited in her demurrer papers. According to counsel, the phrase \u201cotherwise\nuses\u201d in subdivision (c)(1) of section 502 has been interpreted by at least one\nfederal district court as referring to conduct that is similar to the preceding\nlist of prohibited conduct\u2014i.e., some usage that is akin to \u201calter[ing],\n\ndamag[ing], delet[ing], [or] destroy[ing]\u201d the data.4 She therefore maintained\nthat, in order for the cross-complaint to set out a valid claim under\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B), the usage of a computer-related item referred to in the\ncross-complaint must be a reference to using the data itself improperly, and\ncould not refer to using a computer or computer network to access data.\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court confirmed its tentative\nruling denying Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court\u2019s written minute\norder provided its reasoning:\n\n\n\n\n4     In demurrer papers, Persky cited two federal district court decisions for\nthis proposition. (See Ticketmaster L.L.C. v. Prestige Entm\u2019t West, Inc.\n(C.D.Cal. 2018) 315 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1175 and McGowan v. Weinstein\n(C.D.Cal. 2020) 505 F.Supp.3d 1000, 1020.)\n                                         8\n\f         \u201cHere, the sole cause of action in the cross-complaint [ROA\n         # 31] alleges that Persky allegedly improperly accessed\n         Strata Global\u2019s computer data, in violation of the Penal\n         Code. The specific type of data, how it was used, and/or to\n         whom the information was communicated are all facts that\n         might evidence the alleged violation, but are not necessary\n         for the claim to proceed.\u201d\n\nGiven its conclusion that the cross-complaint did not arise from protected\nactivity, the court declined to address the second anti-SLAPP prong.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Anti-SLAPP Framework\n\n      The anti-SLAPP statute, set out in Code of Civil Procedure section\n425.16, creates a summary-judgment-like procedure at the outset of a case to\nprotect litigants from meritless lawsuits that might chill the exercise of\nconstitutional rights to free speech and petition. (Wilson v. Cable News\nNetwork, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 883\u2013884.) Resolving an anti-SLAPP\nmotion involves two steps. The moving party bears the initial burden to\nestablish that the challenged causes of action arise from its protected speech\nor petitioning activity. (Id. at p. 884; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e) [listing four\ncategories of protected activity].) If the moving party carries its burden, the\nburden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate that its claims have at\nleast minimal merit. (Wilson, at p. 884.) \u201cOnly a cause of action that\nsatisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from\nprotected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP,\nsubject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29\nCal.4th 82, 89; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n      In meeting its prong one burden, \u201cthe moving [party] must identify the\nacts alleged in the complaint that it asserts are protected and what claims for\nrelief are predicated on them. In turn, a court should examine whether those\n                                         9\n\facts are protected and supply the basis for any claims.\u201d (Bonni v. St. Joseph\nHealth System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010 (Bonni).) \u201c[A] claim may be struck\nonly if the speech or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and\nnot just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act for which\nliability is asserted.\u201d (Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n(2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1060 (Park), italics added.) \u201cA claim arises from\nprotected activity when that activity underlies or forms the basis for the\nclaim.\u201d (Id. at p. 1062.) Only if the anti-SLAPP movant meets its prong one\nburden does the burden then shift to the opposing party to \u201cdemonstrate that\neach challenged claim based on protected activity is legally sufficient and\nfactually substantiated.\u201d (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396 (Baral).)\n      We review the grant or denial of an anti-SLAPP motion de novo. (Park,\nsupra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1067.) In appeals in which the inquiry focuses on prong\none, \u201c[w]e exercise independent judgment in determining whether, based on\nour own review of the record, the challenged claims arise from protected\nactivity.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cIn addition to the pleadings, we may consider affidavits\nconcerning the facts upon which liability is based. [Citations.] We do not,\nhowever, weigh the evidence, but accept [the pleading party\u2019s] submissions as\ntrue and consider only whether any contrary evidence from the [anti-SLAPP\nmovant] establishes its entitlement to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d (Ibid.)\nIn determining whether a claim or claims arise from protected activity, we\nconsider the elements of the claims, the actions alleged to establish those\nelements, and whether those actions are protected activities. (Bonni, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 1015.) If a cause of action is determined to involve both\nprotected and unprotected activity, the unprotected activity is disregarded at\nthe conclusion of the first stage of the anti-SLAPP analysis. (Baral, supra,\n1 Cal.5th at p. 396.)\n\n\n                                       10\n\fB.   Strata\u2019s cross-claims do not arise from protected activity.\n\n      As the party moving to strike, Persky bears the burden on prong one to\ndemonstrate that \u201c \u2018the challenged claim arises from activity protected by\n[Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16.\u2019 \u201d (Olson v. Doe (2022) 12 Cal.5th\n669, 678.) He alleges that Strata\u2019s cross-complaint asserts multiple claims\nagainst him, all of which arise from his protected activity under subdivisions\n(e)(1) and/or (e)(2) of section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nSubdivision (e)(1) protects \u201cany written or oral statement or writing made\nbefore a . . . judicial proceeding\u201d while subdivision (e)(2) protects \u201cany\nwritten or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under\nconsideration or review by a . . . judicial body.\u201d Strata does not appear to\ndispute that communications between Persky and his attorney regarding the\nlegal invoice at issue would constitute protected activity for purposes of the\nanti-SLAPP statute, but it denies that its claims against Persky arise from\nPersky\u2019s communications with his attorney.\n      In determining whether a party\u2019s claims arise from protected activity,\ncourts are to \u201cconsider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions\nby the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for\nliability.\u201d (Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1063.) The defending party\u2019s burden\nis to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those\nacts are protected under section 424.16. (Wilson, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 884.)\n      Although Strata drafted its cross-complaint as comprising a single\ncause of action, titled \u201cViolation of Comprehensive Computer Data and\nAccess Fraud Act (Cal. Pen. Code[,] \u00a7 502),\u201d a review of the allegations of the\ncross-complaint demonstrate that it has set forth at least three separate\nclaims for relief within that single cause of action. Specifically, Strata alleges\nthat Persky violated three separate subdivisions of section 502: (c)(1)(b),\n\n                                       11\n\f(c)(2), and (c)(7).5 While all of these subdivisions relate generally to the\nunauthorized accessing of computer networks or data, each subdivision sets\nout slightly different conduct as illegal, while often using similar or even\nidentical language. (See People v. Hawkins (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1440\n[\u201cthe statute describes a number of computer crimes in somewhat\noverlapping language\u201d].)\n      For example, subdivision (c)(1)(B) of section 502 makes it illegal to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ] any data, computer, computer system, or\ncomputer network in order to . . . wrongfully control or obtain money,\nproperty, or data.\u201d Subdivision (c)(2) makes it illegal for any person to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission take[ ], cop[y], or make[ ] use of\nany data from a computer, computer system, or computer network, or take[ ]\nor cop[y] any supporting documentation, whether existing or residing internal\nor external to a computer, computer system, or computer network.\u201d And\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes it illegal for one to knowingly and without\npermission access or \u201ccause[ ] to be accessed\u201d a computer or computer system\nor network. In other words, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) of section 502 do\nnot mandate that the accessing of the data, computer, computer system or\nnetwork be done without authorization. Instead they require that some\nadditional conduct have been done without authorization. In contrast,\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes the mere accessing of a computer, computer system\nor computer network illegal if it was done without authorization.\n\n\n5     Strata also alleges that it is continuing to investigate whether Persky\nalso violated subdivision (c)(4) of section 502 by having \u201caltered, damaged,\ndeleted, or destroyed any of Strata Global\u2019s other data without permission,\u201d\nbut the cross-complaint does not assert a claim for relief based on this\nsubdivision.\n                                       12\n\f      Because any violation of the various subdivisions of section 502 could\nprovide Strata with a basis for relief, we must examine Strata\u2019s claims under\neach subdivision to determine whether it arises from protected activity. As\nthe Supreme Court explained in Bonni, a court \u201cshould analyze each claim for\nrelief\u2014each act or set of acts supplying a basis for relief, of which there may\nbe several in a single pleaded cause of action\u2014to determine whether the acts\nare protected and, if so, whether the claim they give rise to has the requisite\ndegree of merit to survive the motion.\u201d (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1010.)\n      Persky initially argues that all three of Strata\u2019s claims for relief under\nsection 502 \u201carose from the alleged use of supposedly wrongfully procured\ndata in litigation.\u201d He further reasons that the \u201cdata\u201d wrongfully procured\nmust be the \u201clegal invoice,\u201d and that pursuant to the allegations of the cross-\ncomplaint, the only possible alleged \u201cuse\u201d of this invoice \u201crelates to Persky\nand his attorney\u2019s communications about the legal invoice.\u201d Just as he did in\nhis arguments before the trial court, Persky relies on four particular\nparagraphs in the cross-complaint to assert that the claims must arise from\nhis protected activity in communicating with his attorney about Strata\u2019s legal\ninvoice. According to Persky, that his communications with his attorney\nforms the basis of Strata\u2019s claims against him is particularly apparent from\nthe cross-complaint\u2019s allegation that \u201cPersky has knowingly accessed Strata\nGlobal\u2019s computer network and file databases impermissibly to access,\ndownload, copy, or otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\nthe company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2), and 502(c)(7) of\nthe Penal Code, Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 502(c), et seq.\u201d (Italics added.) He relies on\nadditional allegations that similarly attempt to explain why Persky accessed\nthe invoice. (Ante, p. 4.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f      While we appreciate the basis for the argument, we view these\nallegations and the claims in cross-complaint differently than Persky does.\nSpecifically, an examination of the elements of the claims at issue as well as\nthe relief sought by Strata makes it clear that Strata\u2019s claims are not\npredicated on Persky\u2019s asserted protected conduct \u2014i.e., his communications\nabout and/or use of the legal invoice.\n      As an initial matter, it is readily apparent that Strata\u2019s claim for relief\nunder subdivision (c)(7) of section 502 cannot arise from Persky\u2019s conduct in\nsharing or discussing the legal invoice with his attorney. As previously\nnoted, subdivision (c)(7) proscribes the knowingly unauthorized accessing of a\ncomputer system or network. There is no need to demonstrate why the\ncomputer system or network was accessed. Thus, Strata need only allege and\nultimately prove that Persky knowingly accessed its computer system and\ndid so without permission. Nothing about these elements implicates\ncommunicative or other litigation-related conduct that could be considered\nprotected under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n      We also conclude that Strata\u2019s claims for violations of subdivisions\n(c)(2) or (c)(1)(B) of section 502 do not arise from Persky\u2019s protected activity.\nPersky appears to assume that Strata\u2019s claim under subdivisions (c)(1)(B)\nand (c)(2) are and can only be based on his accessing Strata\u2019s computer\nsystem to \u201cuse\u201d Strata\u2019s data\u2014in the form of the legal invoice\u2014to obtain an\nadvantage in his litigation against Strata. He states that the \u201cobvious and\nnecessary implication of [the] allegation [that Persky\u2019s counsel provided the\nfile path for the folder that Persky accessed] is that Persky communicated\nand conveyed the invoice to his counsel \u2018for use against [Strata] in this\nlitigation.\u2019 \u201d He then argues: \u201cThis would appear to be the \u2018use\u2019 upon which\nStrata predicated its section 502, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) allegations.\u201d\n\n\n                                         14\n\f\u201c[T]here is,\u201d in his view, \u201cno other use alleged in the Cross-Complaint, and\ncertainly no allegation that Persky altered, damaged, deleted, or destroyed\nthe invoice.\u201d (Italics added.) We disagree.\n      First, with respect to section 502, subdivision (c)(2), a violation occurs\nas soon as an individual \u201cknowingly access[es]\u201d a computer or computer\nsystem or network and then, without permission, \u201cdownload[s], cop[ies], or\notherwise take[s] or make[s] use of\u201d data. (Italics added.) The use of \u201cor\u201d in\nthe subdivision makes clear that only one of the listed activities must take\nplace\u2014either, the downloading, copying, taking or making use of data\u2014for a\nviolation to occur. Strata\u2019s cross-complaint specifically alleges that Persky\nviolated this subdivision by accessing Strata\u2019s computer network and\ndatabases, and without permission \u201cdownload[ing], copy[ing], or otherwise\ntak[ing]\u201d data that belonged to Strata. The allegation of Persky\u2019s motive\u2014\nthat he downloaded, copied or took the data for a particular purpose, i.e., \u201cfor\nhis own use in his lawsuit against\u201d Strata\u2014is unnecessary to the claim, as\nsubdivision (c)(2) does not require that the data be downloaded, copied, or\ntaken for any particular purpose. Thus, this aspect of the allegation merely\nprovides context as to Persky\u2019s possible reason for engaging in the activity\nthat constitutes the wrong complained of\u2014i.e., the accessing and\nimpermissibly downloading/copying/taking data\u2014but is not itself the\nactionable wrong and it is therefore not the subject of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute. (See Baral, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 394.)\n      The allegations regarding the damages Strata asserts that it suffered\nas a result of Persky\u2019s violative conduct further demonstrate that Strata is\nnot seeking recovery based on Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity, but is\ninstead claiming damages arising from Persky\u2019s noncommunicative conduct.\nStrata alleges that it has been damaged \u201cby the costs necessary to conduct\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion and the damages caused thereby, including [reasonable] attorneys\u2019\nfees arising therefrom,\u201d and further asserts that Persky\u2019s \u201cactions were a\nsubstantial factor in th[is] harm to Strata Global because, as a direct result of\nhis actions, Strata Global has been forced to divert other employees from\ntheir regular tasks and retain a computer forensic analysis firm to perform\nan internal investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion into Strata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\nfiles.\u201d Strata is not seeking damages related to any possible harm to its\nlitigation position as result of Persky\u2019s sharing the contents of the invoice,\nnor is it requesting any injunctive relief in connection with the Persky\n\nlitigation.6\n      We also conclude that, like Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(2) of\nsection 502, Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(1)(B) does not arise from\nprotected conduct. The elements necessary to set out a claim for a violation\nof subdivision (c)(1)(B) are three-fold: (1) the individual must \u201c[k]nowingly\naccess[ ] . . . any data, computer, computer system, or computer network\u201d;\n(2) the individual must \u201cwithout permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ]\u201d that same \u201cdata, computer, computer system,\nor computer network\u201d; and (3) the accessing and \u201calter[ing], damage[ing],\ndelet[ing], destroy[ing], or otherwise us[ing]\u201d of the \u201cdata, computer,\ncomputer system, or computer network\u201d must have been done for a specific\n\n\n6     In fact, the cross-complaint does not set forth an allegation that Persky\nshared the invoice itself, or any information contained within the invoice,\nwith his attorney. The cross complaint merely explains how Strata learned\nabout the allegedly unlawful conduct by asserting that Persky\u2019s attorney\nadvised Strata\u2019s counsel that Persky had \u201cgained access to\u201d legal invoices,\nand that the attorney \u201cprovide[d] the file path for the folder that Mr. Persky\naccessed.\u201d\n                                       16\n\fpurpose\u2014i.e., it must have been done \u201cin order to . . . wrongfully control or\nobtain money, property, or data.\u201d\n      Persky assumes that Strata is alleging that the basis for the first and\nsecond elements is his intentional accessing of Strata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d (i.e., the\ninvoice) and his unauthorized \u201cuse\u201d of that same \u201cdata.\u201d Persky again\nassumes that Strata\u2019s complaint must be read as alleging that he \u201cused\u201d\nStrata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d in his lawsuit, relying on the allegation that he downloaded or\ncopied the data \u201cfor use against [Strata] in this litigation.\u201d But we do not\nread Strata\u2019s cross-complaint this way, particularly when we consider the\nnature of the damages that Strata identifies in its pleading. Rather,\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B) may be satisfied not only by knowingly accessing \u201cdata,\u201d\nbut also by knowingly accessing a computer or computer system or network.\nAnd Strata is alleging that accessing a computer or computer system is\nprecisely what Persky did: \u201cMr. Persky knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s\ncomputer network and file databases.\u201d And the allegations in the cross-\ncomplaint further assert that Persky used the computer network and file\ndatabases to \u201cwrongfully . . . obtain . . . data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd. (c)(1)(B), italics\nadded). In other words, Strata is alleging that Persky knowingly accessed\nand then impermissibly used the computer network in order to wrongfully\n\nobtain (by downloading or copying) an electronic copy of the invoice.7 This\nunderstanding of the allegations of the cross-complaint is consistent with the\nlimited recovery Strata is seeking\u2014i.e., compensatory damages to recover the\ncosts involved in connection with investigating and repairing anything\n\n\n7      We do not decide whether such an allegation would\u2014or would not\u2014\nsuffice to state a claim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1), as that issue is\nnot before us. Rather, we are merely identifying the conduct underlying\nStrata\u2019s asserted claim under this subdivision for purposes of determining\nwhether the claim must be stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n                                         17\n\fdamaged as a result of Persky\u2019s intrusion into its confidential data files on its\ncomputer network.\n      We therefore agree with the trial court that none of Strata\u2019s claims\narise from Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity so as to be subject to an\nanti-SLAPP motion. Strata is instead seeking to hold Persky liable under all\nthree identified subdivisions of section 502 based on his unauthorized\naccessing and use of Strata\u2019s computer network. Because Persky did not\nmeet his prong one burden as to any of the claims for relief asserted in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint, the trial court properly denied his motion without\nreaching prong two.

Strata is\nentitled to recover costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                             DATO, Acting P.

(Strata) for employment-related claims.1 As the litigation was\nproceeding, counsel for Persky informed Strata that Persky had been able to\naccess at least one legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel regarding work related\nto Persky\u2019s lawsuit. Strata then filed a cross-complaint alleging that Persky\n\nhad violated Penal Code2 section 502, which prohibits unauthorized access to\ncomputers, computer systems, and computer networks, by allegedly accessing\nStrata\u2019s \u201ccomputer network and file databases\u201d and viewing and obtaining\ndata contained within them, including the legal invoice. Persky filed an anti-\nSLAPP motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16), asserting that the claims in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint arose from Persky\u2019s protected activity involving the\nlitigation between the parties. The trial court denied the motion, concluding\nthat Strata\u2019s cross-claims against Persky are based on unprotected activity.\nWe agree and affirm the court\u2019s order.\n\n              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.   The Complaint and Cross-complaint\n\n      In April 2022, Persky filed his complaint against Strata, a real estate\ninvesting firm, alleging breach of his employment agreement and related\nLabor Code claims. At the time he filed the lawsuit, Persky was employed as\nthe Managing Director of Finance, and he continued to work in that role as\nthe litigation proceeded.\n      At some point after filing this action, Persky accessed Strata\u2019s\naccounting records through its computer network. Relevant to this appeal,\n\n\n1     Melissa Frerichs, another Strata employee, also joined Persky as a\nplaintiff in the lawsuit against Strata, but she is not a party to this appeal.\n2     Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n                                         2\n\fPersky is alleged to have reviewed documents in a corporate management file\ndatabase, one of which was a legal invoice from Strata\u2019s counsel related to\nPersky\u2019s action. At the time, Persky did not advise Strata he had looked at\nthe invoice. In late May 2022, Persky\u2019s lawyer informed Strata\u2019s counsel that\nPersky had accessed a legal invoice.\n      In June 2022, Strata filed a cross-complaint against Persky, alleging a\nsingle cause of action for the violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data\nAccess and Fraud Act, codified at section 502 of the Penal Code based on\nPersky\u2019s accessing of Strata\u2019s computer network and electronic files stored\n\nthere.3 It specifically referenced as the basis for relief three subdivisions of\nsection 502: (c)(1)(B), (c)(2), and (c)(7). The cross-complaint sought\ncompensatory damages, which included \u201call expenditures to investigate\nStrata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd.\n(e)(1)), as well as punitive damages (id., subd. (e)(4)), attorney fees (id., subd.\n(e)(2)), and other unspecified injunctive or equitable relief \u201cas the Court\ndeems just and reasonable\u201d (id., subd. (e)(1)).\n\nB.   Persky\u2019s Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      Persky filed a special motion to strike the cross-complaint under Code\nof Civil Procedure section 425.16. He asserted that Strata\u2019s cause of action\nfor a violation of section 502 arose from his protected activity because the\n\u201cgravamen of Strata\u2019s claim is that Persky impermissibly accessed Strata\u2019s\nfiles to communicate documents to his attorneys so that he could gain a\nlitigation advantage.\u201d Persky further argued that the \u201cclaim is premised on\ncommunications by Persky\u2019s counsel to Strata\u2019s counsel relating to a legal\n\n\n3      Strata alleged that Persky \u201cnavigated five (5) layers of folders outside\nof his [employment] purview and job responsibilities in order to access the\nfolder containing [Strata\u2019s attorneys\u2019] legal invoice.\u201d\n                                         3\n\finvoice that Strata had improperly made available to Persky and other\nemployees.\u201d\n      Persky\u2019s motion principally relied on the allegations in paragraphs 12,\n13, 18, and 19 of the cross-complaint. These allegations are as follows:\n          \u201c[W]ithout authorization, Mr. Persky has been rummaging\n          through Strata Global\u2019s network and databases, including\n          its corporate management database, to obtain information\n          and documentation, such as legal invoices, which Mr.\n          Persky knows are outside his permitted access for use\n          against Strata Global in this litigation.\u201d\n\n          \u201cAfter four months, on May 25, 2022, Strata Global\u2019s\n          counsel finally was advised by counsel for Mr. Persky that\n          Mr. Persky had gained access to EGS\u2019s legal invoices on\n          Strata Global\u2019s shared company server. Strata Global is\n          informed and believes and thereon alleges that Mr. Persky\n          accessed at least one legal invoice and viewed its contents.\n          Mr. Persky\u2019s counsel thereafter provide the file path for the\n          folder that Mr. Persky accessed.\u201d\n\n          \u201c[F]rom December 2021 to present, Mr. Persky has\n          knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer network and\n          file databases impermissibly to access, download, copy, or\n          otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\n          the company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2),\n          and 502(c)(7) of the Penal Code, Cal. Pen. Code, \u00a7 502(c), et\n          seq.\u201d\n\n          \u201cMr. Persky knowingly and willfully accessed confidential\n          and privileged litigation documents, taking the contents\n          therein in violation of Section 502(c)(2) of the Penal Code,\n          with malice and to irreparably harm the case for the\n          defense in this litigation.\u201d\n\n      With respect to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Persky\nargued that the litigation privilege barred Strata\u2019s claim, making it\nimpossible for Strata to establish a probability of prevailing on its cause of\naction.\n                                        4\n\fC.   Strata\u2019s Opposition\n\n      In response to Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, Strata primarily argued\nthat the conduct by Persky forming the basis for its cross-complaint was not a\n\u201c \u2018written or oral statement or writing\u2019 \u201d in an official proceeding. Rather,\naccording to Strata, the conduct underlying its claims was Persky\u2019s\n\u201caccessing, viewing, and taking privileged and confidential data from Strata\nGlobal\u2019s network . . . , not his discussions with counsel.\u201d Strata specifically\ndisclaimed that the cross-complaint included any allegation founded on\nPersky\u2019s \u201cintention to communicate any stolen data to his attorneys,\u201d\ncontrary to Persky\u2019s argument otherwise.\n      Strata also asserted that, to the extent the burden was shifted to Strata\nto demonstrate its cross-complaint had minimal merit, it could show a\nprobability of success on the merits. Strata maintained that Persky\u2019s status\nas an employee of Strata at the time of the alleged unlawful access to the\ncomputer network and databases did not bar its claim under section 502 as a\nmatter of law. It also contended that the litigation privilege did not apply\nbecause its cross-complaint was \u201cnot premised on Mr. Persky\u2019s\ncommunication to his attorneys,\u201d but was instead \u201cpremised entirely on his\nconduct in illegally accessing\u201d Strata\u2019s computer network and files.\n      Strata filed the declaration of one of its attorneys of record, Eric\nLandau, who provided further definition for the factual basis of Strata\u2019s\ncross-claims. Landau stated that on May 25, 2022, he received an email from\nPersky\u2019s lawyer \u201cstating that one of his clients accessed a litigation invoice\nfrom [Strata\u2019s counsel of record] pertaining to this action on [Strata\u2019s]\nNetwork.\u201d Landau inquired as to which plaintiff had gained access and how\nthe access had been gained. Counsel indicated that Persky had accessed the\ninvoice through an \u201cAccounts Payable folder.\u201d Landau initiated an\n\n                                        5\n\finvestigation into the matter on Strata\u2019s behalf, which included interviews of\nrelevant Strata employees. Strata filed the cross-complaint against Persky\non the basis of its preliminary investigation, but at the time of the filing of\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, Strata\u2019s investigation was still \u201congoing,\u201d and it had\nhired a digital forensics expert to assist in the investigation. Landau\nindicated that individuals from his office had \u201cspent approximately 25 hours\u201d\ninvestigating the matter at the time of filing the opposition to Persky\u2019s anti-\nSLAPP motion.\n      Strata also submitted a declaration from Rezlyn Palma, its Chief\nAccounting Officer. Palma explained that Strata uses a \u201cshared folder\nsystem to save files for documents related to\u201d its corporate operations.\nTypically, Strata saves invoices and proof of payment as a single .pdf file,\nwhich is then saved in subfolders representing the month and year in which\nthe invoice was paid, which are themselves saved within subfolder after\nsubfolder, all of which are located within the general \u201cAccounting\u201d folder.\nThe invoice and proof of payment that Persky accessed had been saved in this\nmanner.\n      Finally, Strata submitted a declaration from David Thompson, a digital\nforensics investigator hired by Strata to investigate Persky\u2019s \u201ccomputer\nactivities . . . in the Strata Global network and company database.\u201d\nThompson \u201cwas able to determine to a reasonable degree of professional\ncertainty that\u201d Persky used his Strata desktop computer to \u201caccess[ ] and\nopen[ ]\u201d the .pdf document containing the legal invoice and proof of payment\nthat was stored on Strata\u2019s network. At the time Persky accessed the file, the\ninvoice and proof of payment had been saved \u201cwithin five layers of sub-\nfolders.\u201d Thompson indicated that he had spent more than 60 hours on his\ninvestigation, and that his rate was $350 per hour.\n\n\n                                        6\n\fD.   Hearing on the Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n      The trial court provided the parties with a tentative ruling in which it\nindicated an intent to deny Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court noted\nthat the basis for Strata\u2019s sole cause of action was the allegation that \u201cPersky\nallegedly improperly accessed Strata Global\u2019s computer data,\u201d and that any\nallegations about the type of data that was accessed, how that data may have\nbeen used, and/or with whom the data may have been shared was\ninformation that was not necessary for Strata to succeed on its cause of\naction.\n      At oral argument, counsel for Persky began by noting that Strata had\nset out three violations of section 502, under three different subdivisions of\nthe statute, and that each claim should be \u201cevaluated separately for purposes\nof the anti-SLAPP motion.\u201d Specifically, counsel noted that, at least with\nrespect to a claim for relief under subdivision (c)(1)(B), the provision requires\nthat the defendant \u201cdid something after\u201d accessing data\u2014that is, the\ndefendant must have \u201caltered, damaged, deleted, or otherwise uses the data.\u201d\nShe noted \u201cthere is not a single allegation of Mr. Persky altering, damaging,\ndeleting or destroying any data,\u201d and that the \u201conly allegation Strata submits\nto support its section 502(c)(1)(B) claim is Mr. Persky\u2019s use of that data in\nthis litigation.\u201d Counsel asserted that, as a result, the allegations in\nparagraphs 12, 18, and 19, as well as the claim for a violation of subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) must be stricken.\n      In response to the argument by Persky\u2019s attorney, counsel for Strata\nasserted that Persky\u2019s application of the allegations of the complaint to a\nclaim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1)(B) was based on a too-limited\nreading of that provision. Strata\u2019s attorney explained that if subdivision\n(c)(1)(B) \u201cended with \u2018or otherwise uses any data,\u2019 \u201d then Persky\u2019s contention\n\n                                        7\n\fmight have some validity. But the subdivision instead continues beyond the\nword \u201cdata,\u201d and \u201csays \u2018or otherwise uses any data, computer, computer\nsystem, or computer network.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he explained, \u201c[t]he\nword \u2018use\u2019 is not limited to the use of the data, . . . but [is] expanded to both\nthe data, a computer system, and a computer network.\u201d Because the usage\nreferred to in subdivision (c)(1) may be done with respect to a computer\nsystem or network, it was not necessary for Strata to meet the \u201cuse\u201d element\nwith an allegation as to how any particular data may have been used in the\ncontext of the litigation between the parties.\n      Persky\u2019s attorney responded with an argument related to one she had\nposited in her demurrer papers. According to counsel, the phrase \u201cotherwise\nuses\u201d in subdivision (c)(1) of section 502 has been interpreted by at least one\nfederal district court as referring to conduct that is similar to the preceding\nlist of prohibited conduct\u2014i.e., some usage that is akin to \u201calter[ing],\n\ndamag[ing], delet[ing], [or] destroy[ing]\u201d the data.4 She therefore maintained\nthat, in order for the cross-complaint to set out a valid claim under\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B), the usage of a computer-related item referred to in the\ncross-complaint must be a reference to using the data itself improperly, and\ncould not refer to using a computer or computer network to access data.\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court confirmed its tentative\nruling denying Persky\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion. The court\u2019s written minute\norder provided its reasoning:\n\n\n\n\n4     In demurrer papers, Persky cited two federal district court decisions for\nthis proposition. (See Ticketmaster L.L.C. v.

The specific type of data, how it was used, and/or to\n         whom the information was communicated are all facts that\n         might evidence the alleged violation, but are not necessary\n         for the claim to proceed.\u201d\n\nGiven its conclusion that the cross-complaint did not arise from protected\nactivity, the court declined to address the second anti-SLAPP prong.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Anti-SLAPP Framework\n\n      The anti-SLAPP statute, set out in Code of Civil Procedure section\n425.16, creates a summary-judgment-like procedure at the outset of a case to\nprotect litigants from meritless lawsuits that might chill the exercise of\nconstitutional rights to free speech and petition. (Wilson v. Cable News\nNetwork, Inc. (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4418841\"><a href=\"/opinion/4641588/wilson-v-cable-news-network-inc/\">7 Cal.5th 871</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 883\u2013884.) Resolving an anti-SLAPP\nmotion involves two steps. The moving party bears the initial burden to\nestablish that the challenged causes of action arise from its protected speech\nor petitioning activity. (Id. at p. 884; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e) [listing four\ncategories of protected activity].) If the moving party carries its burden, the\nburden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate that its claims have at\nleast minimal merit. (Wilson, at p. 884.) \u201cOnly a cause of action that\nsatisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from\nprotected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP,\nsubject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d (Navellier v.

In turn, a court should examine whether those\n                                         9\n\facts are protected and supply the basis for any claims.\u201d (Bonni v.

In appeals in which the inquiry focuses on prong\none, \u201c[w]e exercise independent judgment in determining whether, based on\nour own review of the record, the challenged claims arise from protected\nactivity.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cIn addition to the pleadings, we may consider affidavits\nconcerning the facts upon which liability is based.

(Bonni, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 1015.) If a cause of action is determined to involve both\nprotected and unprotected activity, the unprotected activity is disregarded at\nthe conclusion of the first stage of the anti-SLAPP analysis.

Strata\u2019s cross-claims do not arise from protected activity.\n\n      As the party moving to strike, Persky bears the burden on prong one to\ndemonstrate that \u201c \u2018the challenged claim arises from activity protected by\n[Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16.\u2019 \u201d (Olson v.

He alleges that Strata\u2019s cross-complaint asserts multiple claims\nagainst him, all of which arise from his protected activity under subdivisions\n(e)(1) and/or (e)(2) of section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nSubdivision (e)(1) protects \u201cany written or oral statement or writing made\nbefore a . . . judicial proceeding\u201d while subdivision (e)(2) protects \u201cany\nwritten or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under\nconsideration or review by a . . . judicial body.\u201d Strata does not appear to\ndispute that communications between Persky and his attorney regarding the\nlegal invoice at issue would constitute protected activity for purposes of the\nanti-SLAPP statute, but it denies that its claims against Persky arise from\nPersky\u2019s communications with his attorney.\n      In determining whether a party\u2019s claims arise from protected activity,\ncourts are to \u201cconsider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions\nby the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for\nliability.\u201d (Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1063.) The defending party\u2019s burden\nis to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those\nacts are protected under section 424.16. (Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4418841\"><a href=\"/opinion/4641588/wilson-v-cable-news-network-inc/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 7 Cal.5th at p. 884.)\n      Although Strata drafted its cross-complaint as comprising a single\ncause of action, titled \u201cViolation of Comprehensive Computer Data and\nAccess Fraud Act (Cal. Pen. Code[,] \u00a7 502),\u201d a review of the allegations of the\ncross-complaint demonstrate that it has set forth at least three separate\nclaims for relief within that single cause of action. Specifically, Strata alleges\nthat Persky violated three separate subdivisions of section 502: (c)(1)(b),\n\n                                       11\n\f(c)(2), and (c)(7).5 While all of these subdivisions relate generally to the\nunauthorized accessing of computer networks or data, each subdivision sets\nout slightly different conduct as illegal, while often using similar or even\nidentical language. (See People v. Hawkins (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276421\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276421/people-v-hawkins/\">98 Cal.App.4th 1428</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1440\n[\u201cthe statute describes a number of computer crimes in somewhat\noverlapping language\u201d].)\n      For example, subdivision (c)(1)(B) of section 502 makes it illegal to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ] any data, computer, computer system, or\ncomputer network in order to . . . wrongfully control or obtain money,\nproperty, or data.\u201d Subdivision (c)(2) makes it illegal for any person to\n\u201c[k]nowingly access[ ] and without permission take[ ], cop[y], or make[ ] use of\nany data from a computer, computer system, or computer network, or take[ ]\nor cop[y] any supporting documentation, whether existing or residing internal\nor external to a computer, computer system, or computer network.\u201d And\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes it illegal for one to knowingly and without\npermission access or \u201ccause[ ] to be accessed\u201d a computer or computer system\nor network. In other words, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) of section 502 do\nnot mandate that the accessing of the data, computer, computer system or\nnetwork be done without authorization. Instead they require that some\nadditional conduct have been done without authorization. In contrast,\nsubdivision (c)(7) makes the mere accessing of a computer, computer system\nor computer network illegal if it was done without authorization.\n\n\n5     Strata also alleges that it is continuing to investigate whether Persky\nalso violated subdivision (c)(4) of section 502 by having \u201caltered, damaged,\ndeleted, or destroyed any of Strata Global\u2019s other data without permission,\u201d\nbut the cross-complaint does not assert a claim for relief based on this\nsubdivision.\n                                       12\n\f      Because any violation of the various subdivisions of section 502 could\nprovide Strata with a basis for relief, we must examine Strata\u2019s claims under\neach subdivision to determine whether it arises from protected activity. As\nthe Supreme Court explained in Bonni, a court \u201cshould analyze each claim for\nrelief\u2014each act or set of acts supplying a basis for relief, of which there may\nbe several in a single pleaded cause of action\u2014to determine whether the acts\nare protected and, if so, whether the claim they give rise to has the requisite\ndegree of merit to survive the motion.\u201d (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1010.)\n      Persky initially argues that all three of Strata\u2019s claims for relief under\nsection 502 \u201carose from the alleged use of supposedly wrongfully procured\ndata in litigation.\u201d He further reasons that the \u201cdata\u201d wrongfully procured\nmust be the \u201clegal invoice,\u201d and that pursuant to the allegations of the cross-\ncomplaint, the only possible alleged \u201cuse\u201d of this invoice \u201crelates to Persky\nand his attorney\u2019s communications about the legal invoice.\u201d Just as he did in\nhis arguments before the trial court, Persky relies on four particular\nparagraphs in the cross-complaint to assert that the claims must arise from\nhis protected activity in communicating with his attorney about Strata\u2019s legal\ninvoice. According to Persky, that his communications with his attorney\nforms the basis of Strata\u2019s claims against him is particularly apparent from\nthe cross-complaint\u2019s allegation that \u201cPersky has knowingly accessed Strata\nGlobal\u2019s computer network and file databases impermissibly to access,\ndownload, copy, or otherwise take data for his own use in his lawsuit against\nthe company in violation of Sections 502(c)(1)(b), 502(c)(2), and 502(c)(7) of\nthe Penal Code, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 502</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c), et seq.\u201d (Italics added.) He relies on\nadditional allegations that similarly attempt to explain why Persky accessed\nthe invoice. (Ante, p. 4.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f      While we appreciate the basis for the argument, we view these\nallegations and the claims in cross-complaint differently than Persky does.\nSpecifically, an examination of the elements of the claims at issue as well as\nthe relief sought by Strata makes it clear that Strata\u2019s claims are not\npredicated on Persky\u2019s asserted protected conduct \u2014i.e., his communications\nabout and/or use of the legal invoice.\n      As an initial matter, it is readily apparent that Strata\u2019s claim for relief\nunder subdivision (c)(7) of section 502 cannot arise from Persky\u2019s conduct in\nsharing or discussing the legal invoice with his attorney. As previously\nnoted, subdivision (c)(7) proscribes the knowingly unauthorized accessing of a\ncomputer system or network. There is no need to demonstrate why the\ncomputer system or network was accessed. Thus, Strata need only allege and\nultimately prove that Persky knowingly accessed its computer system and\ndid so without permission. Nothing about these elements implicates\ncommunicative or other litigation-related conduct that could be considered\nprotected under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n      We also conclude that Strata\u2019s claims for violations of subdivisions\n(c)(2) or (c)(1)(B) of section 502 do not arise from Persky\u2019s protected activity.\nPersky appears to assume that Strata\u2019s claim under subdivisions (c)(1)(B)\nand (c)(2) are and can only be based on his accessing Strata\u2019s computer\nsystem to \u201cuse\u201d Strata\u2019s data\u2014in the form of the legal invoice\u2014to obtain an\nadvantage in his litigation against Strata. He states that the \u201cobvious and\nnecessary implication of [the] allegation [that Persky\u2019s counsel provided the\nfile path for the folder that Persky accessed] is that Persky communicated\nand conveyed the invoice to his counsel \u2018for use against [Strata] in this\nlitigation.\u2019 \u201d He then argues: \u201cThis would appear to be the \u2018use\u2019 upon which\nStrata predicated its section 502, subdivisions (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2) allegations.\u201d\n\n\n                                         14\n\f\u201c[T]here is,\u201d in his view, \u201cno other use alleged in the Cross-Complaint, and\ncertainly no allegation that Persky altered, damaged, deleted, or destroyed\nthe invoice.\u201d (Italics added.) We disagree.\n      First, with respect to section 502, subdivision (c)(2), a violation occurs\nas soon as an individual \u201cknowingly access[es]\u201d a computer or computer\nsystem or network and then, without permission, \u201cdownload[s], cop[ies], or\notherwise take[s] or make[s] use of\u201d data. (Italics added.) The use of \u201cor\u201d in\nthe subdivision makes clear that only one of the listed activities must take\nplace\u2014either, the downloading, copying, taking or making use of data\u2014for a\nviolation to occur. Strata\u2019s cross-complaint specifically alleges that Persky\nviolated this subdivision by accessing Strata\u2019s computer network and\ndatabases, and without permission \u201cdownload[ing], copy[ing], or otherwise\ntak[ing]\u201d data that belonged to Strata. The allegation of Persky\u2019s motive\u2014\nthat he downloaded, copied or took the data for a particular purpose, i.e., \u201cfor\nhis own use in his lawsuit against\u201d Strata\u2014is unnecessary to the claim, as\nsubdivision (c)(2) does not require that the data be downloaded, copied, or\ntaken for any particular purpose. Thus, this aspect of the allegation merely\nprovides context as to Persky\u2019s possible reason for engaging in the activity\nthat constitutes the wrong complained of\u2014i.e., the accessing and\nimpermissibly downloading/copying/taking data\u2014but is not itself the\nactionable wrong and it is therefore not the subject of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute. (See Baral, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4020411\"><a href=\"/opinion/4243150/baral-v-schnitt/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 1 Cal.5th at p. 394.)\n      The allegations regarding the damages Strata asserts that it suffered\nas a result of Persky\u2019s violative conduct further demonstrate that Strata is\nnot seeking recovery based on Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity, but is\ninstead claiming damages arising from Persky\u2019s noncommunicative conduct.\nStrata alleges that it has been damaged \u201cby the costs necessary to conduct\n\n\n                                       15\n\fthe investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion and the damages caused thereby, including [reasonable] attorneys\u2019\nfees arising therefrom,\u201d and further asserts that Persky\u2019s \u201cactions were a\nsubstantial factor in th[is] harm to Strata Global because, as a direct result of\nhis actions, Strata Global has been forced to divert other employees from\ntheir regular tasks and retain a computer forensic analysis firm to perform\nan internal investigation to ascertain the full extent of Mr. Persky\u2019s unlawful\nintrusion into Strata Global\u2019s computer network, file databases, and data\nfiles.\u201d Strata is not seeking damages related to any possible harm to its\nlitigation position as result of Persky\u2019s sharing the contents of the invoice,\nnor is it requesting any injunctive relief in connection with the Persky\n\nlitigation.6\n      We also conclude that, like Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(2) of\nsection 502, Strata\u2019s claim under subdivision (c)(1)(B) does not arise from\nprotected conduct. The elements necessary to set out a claim for a violation\nof subdivision (c)(1)(B) are three-fold: (1) the individual must \u201c[k]nowingly\naccess[ ] . . . any data, computer, computer system, or computer network\u201d;\n(2) the individual must \u201cwithout permission alter[ ], damage[ ], delete[ ],\ndestroy[ ], or otherwise use[ ]\u201d that same \u201cdata, computer, computer system,\nor computer network\u201d; and (3) the accessing and \u201calter[ing], damage[ing],\ndelet[ing], destroy[ing], or otherwise us[ing]\u201d of the \u201cdata, computer,\ncomputer system, or computer network\u201d must have been done for a specific\n\n\n6     In fact, the cross-complaint does not set forth an allegation that Persky\nshared the invoice itself, or any information contained within the invoice,\nwith his attorney. The cross complaint merely explains how Strata learned\nabout the allegedly unlawful conduct by asserting that Persky\u2019s attorney\nadvised Strata\u2019s counsel that Persky had \u201cgained access to\u201d legal invoices,\nand that the attorney \u201cprovide[d] the file path for the folder that Mr. Persky\naccessed.\u201d\n                                       16\n\fpurpose\u2014i.e., it must have been done \u201cin order to . . . wrongfully control or\nobtain money, property, or data.\u201d\n      Persky assumes that Strata is alleging that the basis for the first and\nsecond elements is his intentional accessing of Strata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d (i.e., the\ninvoice) and his unauthorized \u201cuse\u201d of that same \u201cdata.\u201d Persky again\nassumes that Strata\u2019s complaint must be read as alleging that he \u201cused\u201d\nStrata\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d in his lawsuit, relying on the allegation that he downloaded or\ncopied the data \u201cfor use against [Strata] in this litigation.\u201d But we do not\nread Strata\u2019s cross-complaint this way, particularly when we consider the\nnature of the damages that Strata identifies in its pleading. Rather,\nsubdivision (c)(1)(B) may be satisfied not only by knowingly accessing \u201cdata,\u201d\nbut also by knowingly accessing a computer or computer system or network.\nAnd Strata is alleging that accessing a computer or computer system is\nprecisely what Persky did: \u201cMr. Persky knowingly accessed Strata Global\u2019s\ncomputer network and file databases.\u201d And the allegations in the cross-\ncomplaint further assert that Persky used the computer network and file\ndatabases to \u201cwrongfully . . . obtain . . . data\u201d (\u00a7 502, subd. (c)(1)(B), italics\nadded). In other words, Strata is alleging that Persky knowingly accessed\nand then impermissibly used the computer network in order to wrongfully\n\nobtain (by downloading or copying) an electronic copy of the invoice.7 This\nunderstanding of the allegations of the cross-complaint is consistent with the\nlimited recovery Strata is seeking\u2014i.e., compensatory damages to recover the\ncosts involved in connection with investigating and repairing anything\n\n\n7      We do not decide whether such an allegation would\u2014or would not\u2014\nsuffice to state a claim under section 502, subdivision (c)(1), as that issue is\nnot before us. Rather, we are merely identifying the conduct underlying\nStrata\u2019s asserted claim under this subdivision for purposes of determining\nwhether the claim must be stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n                                         17\n\fdamaged as a result of Persky\u2019s intrusion into its confidential data files on its\ncomputer network.\n      We therefore agree with the trial court that none of Strata\u2019s claims\narise from Persky\u2019s speech or petitioning activity so as to be subject to an\nanti-SLAPP motion. Strata is instead seeking to hold Persky liable under all\nthree identified subdivisions of section 502 based on his unauthorized\naccessing and use of Strata\u2019s computer network. Because Persky did not\nmeet his prong one burden as to any of the claims for relief asserted in\nStrata\u2019s cross-complaint, the trial court properly denied his motion without\nreaching prong two.

(the Corporation;\ncollectively, the Williams plaintiffs), appeal from an order of\ndismissal entered as to defendants Buchalter APC and Carol\nLucas (collectively, the Buchalter defendants) after the trial\ncourt sustained without leave to amend the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint. The Williams plaintiffs\nasserted causes of action for conspiracy to defraud, financial elder\nabuse, and declaratory relief against the Buchalter defendants\nbased on allegations that Lucas, an attorney and shareholder at\nBuchalter, conspired with Sevana Petrosian, who was Williams\u2019s\nbusiness partner and managed several medical clinics where\nWilliams conducted his medical practice, to deceive Williams into\nbelieving Buchalter represented him and to induce him to enter\ncontracts that allowed Petrosian to embezzle more than $11\nmillion dollars from the Corporation. In sustaining the\ndemurrer, the trial court found all claims against the Buchalter\ndefendants were barred by the one-year statute of limitations\ngoverning claims against an attorney \u201cfor a wrongful act or\nomission, other than actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 340.6, subdivision (a).2\n\n\n\n\n1     Williams died during the pendency of this appeal. On\nMay 12, 2023 we granted the motion of his widow Gail Dee Lew-\nWilliams to be substituted in place of Williams as his successor in\ninterest.\n2    All further undesignated statutory references are to the\nCode of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\f      On appeal, the Williams plaintiffs contend the one-year\nstatute of limitations under section 340.6, subdivision (a), does\nnot apply to their claims because the gravamen of their action is\nactual fraud. We agree the complaint sufficiently alleged the\nBuchalter defendants conspired to commit actual fraud, such that\nsection 340.6 does not apply and the Corporation\u2019s conspiracy\ncause of action survives demurrer. However, Williams\u2019s\nindividual conspiracy claim fails because, as alleged, only the\nCorporation was defrauded. Moreover, the complaint fails to\nstate claims for financial elder abuse and declaratory relief.\n      We reverse the order of dismissal and the order sustaining\nthe demurrer and direct the trial court to enter a new order\noverruling the demurrer to the Corporation\u2019s cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud and sustaining without leave to amend the\ndemurrer to the Corporation\u2019s remaining causes of action and\nWilliams\u2019s cause of action for conspiracy to defraud.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Complaint\n      The Williams plaintiffs filed this action on May 4, 2022\nagainst the Buchalter defendants and Petrosian, her associates\nSalina Ranjbar, Vana Mehrabian, and Staforde Palmer,\nPetrosian\u2019s wholly owned company Petrosian Esthetic\nEnterprises LLC (Petrosian Esthetic), and seven limited liability\ncompanies Petrosian formed to operate individual medical spas\nunder the name \u201cSEV Laser Aesthetics\u201d (the SEV companies;\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fcollectively, the Petrosian defendants).3 The complaint alleged\nsix causes of action, three of which were asserted against Lucas\nor the Buchalter defendants: the first cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud, the third cause of action for financial elder\nabuse, and the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief.4\n\n3      On September 22, 2021 the Williams plaintiffs filed a\npetition, including a draft complaint, seeking court approval to\nfile an action against the Buchalter defendants for civil\nconspiracy with a client pursuant to Civil Code section 1714.10.\n(Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Carol Lucas, et al. (Super.\nCt. Los Angeles County, 2021, No. 20STCP03133).) On February\n3, 2022 the trial court found the alleged conspiracy to defraud the\nWilliams plaintiffs arose from \u201ctransactional activities\u201d carried\nout by the Buchalter defendants and did not arise \u201cfrom any\nattempt to contest or compromise a claim or dispute\u201d within the\nscope of Civil Code section 1714.10, subdivision (a), and therefore\nthe Williams plaintiffs could file their complaint without\nobtaining court approval.\n4      The complaint also asserted causes of action for breach of\ncontract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nand conspiracy to defraud against one or more of the Petrosian\ndefendants. The allegations asserted against these defendants\noverlap with allegations by the Williams plaintiffs in the related\nactions Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Sevana Petrosian, et\nal. (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV14137) and\nWilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n(Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV15993).\n      The Buchalter defendants request we take judicial notice of\nthe Los Angeles Superior Court online case summaries for these\nrelated actions for the purpose of establishing the date on which\nthe actions were filed. The Buchalter defendants made a similar\nrequest in the trial court that the court take judicial notice of\nvarious pleadings in the related actions, but the court did not\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f       As alleged in the complaint, in late 2013 Williams and\nPetrosian entered into discussions for Petrosian to act as the non-\nmedical manager of medical spas where Williams would conduct\nhis practice. Williams was then 77 years old and in apparent\npoor health. Williams and Petrosian \u201cdecided to act through\ntheir respective corporations.\u201d Williams\u2019s longstanding\naccountant, Leila Aquino, met with Petrosian to discuss the\npreparation of a contract that would govern the parties\u2019\narrangement and suggested a few law firms to assist them.\nHowever, Petrosian stated she already had contacted a lawyer,\nlater identified as Lucas, \u201cwho agreed to represent both parties\nand prepare a contract that is fair to both parties.\u201d Petrosian set\nup a meeting with Lucas.\n       On April 12, 2014 Williams and Aquino met with Petrosian\nand Lucas at Buchalter\u2019s offices (April 12 meeting). Lucas did\nnot tell Williams that she did not represent him, nor did she ask\nhim if he was represented by counsel. Lucas\u2019s statements and\nconduct during the meeting led Williams and Aquino \u201cto believe\nPetrosian\u2019s representations to them, that Lucas represented both\nParties and prepared a fair contract.\u201d Lucas never disclosed that\nshe had been representing Petrosian for over a year.\n\n\n\n\nrule on their request. We deny the request to take judicial notice\nof any trial court records in the related actions because the\nrecords are not relevant to our resolution of this appeal. Because\nwe find the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 claims were filed within the\napplicable statute of limitations, we do not reach the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 arguments that the pleadings in the related actions\ncontain admissions bearing on accrual of the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      During the meeting, Lucas had in front of her a\n\u201cManagement Services Agreement\u201d that she referred to a few\ntimes. She briefly explained to Williams that the laws governing\nthe corporate practice of medicine prohibit non-physicians from\nowning a medical practice, and then she \u201cimmediately moved to\nconvince and advise Dr. Williams to grant [Petrosian Esthetic] a\npower of attorney and Petrosian the right to sign checks and to\npay bills,\u201d explaining this would be necessary for Petrosian\nEsthetic to operate a clinic, collect patient payments, and make\nbank deposits on behalf of Williams\u2019s medical practice. \u201cIn\nreliance on Petrosian\u2019s representation that Lucas represented\nboth Parties and prepared a fair contract, reinforced by Lucas\u2019s\nconduct and statements during the meeting,\u201d on April 12, 2014\nWilliams signed the management services agreement without\nreading it.\n      A copy of the executed management services agreement\nbetween the Corporation and Petrosian Esthetic was attached to\nthe complaint. The recitals state the Corporation \u201cdesires to\nengage the services of [Petrosian Esthetic] to perform certain\nnon-professional functions for [the Corporation], in order to\npermit [the Corporation] to concentrate its efforts on the\nPractice.\u201d\u2019 The \u201cPractice\u201d was defined as the provision of medical\ncosmetic services at medical spa locations in Glendale and West\nHollywood. Under the agreement, the Corporation appointed\nPetrosian Esthetic as its attorney-in-fact for a wide range of non-\nmedical functions, including collecting payments, making\ndeposits, and other banking functions on the account of the\nCorporation (including making payments to Petrosian Esthetic\nfor management services and expenses). Petrosian Esthetic was\nresponsible for providing numerous services on behalf of the\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fCorporation with respect to the practice, including accounting,\nfinancial, and legal services, the employment of non-physician\npersonnel, providing and maintaining furniture, fixtures and\nequipment, and marketing. The agreement also provided\nPetrosian Esthetic would sublease space to the Corporation.\nUnder the agreement, a copy of any notices served pursuant to\nthe agreement would be sent to the attention of Lucas at\nBuchalter\u2019s Los Angeles office.\n      The complaint alleged on information and belief that \u201cfrom\nthe onset Lucas knew of Petrosian\u2019s intent to own the Practice,\ntake all the profits and pay Dr. Williams some kind of salary and,\nupon termination of the agreement, Petrosian intended to take\nover the Practice,\u201d and Lucas drafted the management services\nagreement \u201cin a way to allow Petrosian to achieve her intended\nscheme.\u201d\n      Beginning in 2016 the medical practice expanded to seven\nnew clinic locations, and Lucas, on behalf of Petrosian, formed\nand registered the SEV companies, one for each new location.\nEach of the SEV companies then entered into a management\nservices agreement with the Corporation regarding Williams\u2019s\nmedical practice at the individual locations. Relying on\nPetrosian\u2019s representation that the seven management services\nagreement were identical to the April 12, 2014 management\nservices agreement and that they were prepared by Lucas,\nWilliams signed each agreement on behalf of the Corporation,\nagain without reading the agreements. Each of the management\nservices agreements provided that the respective SEV company\nwould be entitled to actual out-of-pocket costs in providing\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fmanagement services plus a management fee of 15 percent of\nthose costs.5\n       In January 2020 the Corporation received a tax form from\nits credit card processing company indicating the practice had\ncollected credit card payments exceeding $7.5 million in 2019,\nalthough in 2019 the Williams plaintiffs had only received\n$155,000 from the Petrosian defendants. Petrosian had claimed\nthe $155,000 was the net profit from operations. Williams was\nsurprised by the disparity and consulted an attorney in February\n2020. With the help of an accountant, Williams reviewed the\nCorporation\u2019s bank records and determined gross income to the\nCorporation during 2019 exceeded $10.2 million, with estimated\nprofits of about $6 million.\n       On February 17, 2020 the parties mutually agreed to\nterminate their relationship effective April 30, 2020. Following\nthe termination, Petrosian allegedly \u201ctook over\u201d the entire\npractice, including the equipment, patients and employees,\nwithout compensating Williams, and she denied Williams access\nto the clinics. The Petrosian defendants relied on a provision of\nthe management services agreements to claim ownership of the\npractice.6\n\n\n5     A copy of the October 29, 2018 management services\nagreement between the Corporation and SEV Laser Aesthetics-\nSan Jose, LLC was attached to the complaint as an example of\nthe post-2018 management services agreements the Corporation\nentered into with the SEV companies.\n6     Paragraph 4.8 of the management services agreement\nprovides, \u201c[Petrosian Esthetic] has the legal right to occupy the\nspace occupied by the Practice . . . and grants to [Corporation] the\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f        The Williams plaintiffs calculated that between January 1,\n2017 and March 31, 2020, the practice generated gross revenues\nof about $20 million, with estimated overhead of $8 million, but\nthey only received about $400,000 in purported net profits during\nthis period. The complaint alleges on this basis the Petrosian\ndefendants embezzled about $11.4 million from the Corporation.\n       Moreover, in early 2020 the Petrosian defendants withdrew\nabout $2.2 million from the Corporation\u2019s bank accounts,\nincluding more than $700,000 in cash withdrawals. In response\nto an inquiry from the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 attorney about the\nwithdrawals, Lucas stated the funds were charged by Petrosian\nas a \u201clicense fee,\u201d and Lucas produced a set of agreements\nexecuted in 2019 between the SEV companies and Petrosian\nEsthetic under which each SEV company licensed the intellectual\nproperty relating to the \u201cSEV Laser\u201d brand from Petrosian\nEsthetic. Williams was previously unaware of these agreements,\nunder which the Petrosian defendants collected $2.1 million a\nyear in intellectual property license fees.\n       Lucas denied ever representing Williams or the\nCorporation, and she denied preparing the management services\nagreements. Lucas also claimed Buchalter had never billed the\nCorporation for legal services. However, in 2017 Petrosian\nEsthetic paid nearly $8,000 to Buchalter, and in 2018 two of the\nSEV companies paid nearly $30,000 in \u201clegal fees\u201d to the firm.\nThus, \u201cLucas has been paid dozens of thousands of dollars every\nyear by the [p]ractice of Dr Williams, at the same time Lucas was\n\n\n\n\nright to use the Premises for the Practice for as long as this\nAgreement remains in effect (the \u2018Sublease\u2019).\u201d\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fconspiring with Petrosian against Dr. Williams and his\n[p]ractice.\u201d\n      The first cause of action for conspiracy to defraud sought to\nvoid the management services agreements based on Lucas\u2019s and\nPetrosian\u2019s false inducements to cause Williams to enter the\nagreements; damages exceeding $11 million for the\nembezzlement of Corporation funds pursuant to the agreements\nand the overbroad powers of attorney granted to the Petrosian\ndefendants therein; damages for the severe emotional distress\nWilliams suffered as a result of the defendants\u2019 scheme; punitive\nand exemplary damages based on the defendants\u2019 malice; and\nenhanced damages pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 15657.5.\n      The third cause of action for financial elder abuse pursuant\nto Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610 is based on the\nsame factual allegations regarding the Buchalter defendants\u2019\nconduct. The sixth cause of action for declaratory relief, although\nasserted against both the Buchalter defendants and the\nPetrosian defendants, alleges \u201c[a]n actual controversy exists\nbetween Plaintiffs and the [Petrosian defendants]. Plaintiffs\ncontend that the [Petrosian defendants] should be held liable for\nPlaintiffs losses of about $11.5 million. Plaintiffs also contend\nthat they own the Practice, the leases to the clinics, the\nequipment and the electronic communication, as well as the\nwebsite. Plaintiffs also contend that they are entitled to all the\nincome generated from the Practice since May 1, 2020.\nDefendants contend otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fB.     The Buchalter Defendants\u2019 Demurrer and the Trial Court\u2019s\n       Order\n       On July 15, 2022 the Buchalter defendants demurred to all\ncauses of action in the complaint. They argued the claims\nagainst them were barred under the one-year statute of\nlimitations in section 340.6, subdivision (a), which governs claims\n\u201cfor a wrongful act or omission, other than actual fraud, arising\nin the performance of professional services\u201d by an attorney. They\nasserted that, as alleged in the complaint, the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims accrued no later than February 17, 2020, when the parties\nagreed to terminate their relationship based on disputes over\npayments to the Corporation, but the claims against the\nBuchalter defendants were not filed until May 2022.\n       The Buchalter defendants also argued with respect to the\nconspiracy cause of action that the Williams plaintiffs failed to\nsufficiently allege the Buchalter defendants were aware of, or\nknowingly agreed to a \u201c\u2018common and unlawful plan\u2019\u201d to embezzle\nmoney from the Williams plaintiffs. Rather, \u201c[t]hey simply allege\nthat Buchalter performed legal services\u2014such as forming LLCs,\nparticipating in an exchange of information regarding a proposed\nbusiness arrangement during an April 12, 2014 meeting, and\ndrafting agreements\u2014for its client, Sevana Petrosian.\u201d\nMoreover, the \u201cagent\u2019s immunity rule\u201d shielded the Buchalter\ndefendants from liability for acts of misconduct performed as an\nagent of Petrosian, because the Buchalter defendants did not owe\nan independent legal duty to Williams, and further, their acts did\nnot \u201c\u2018go beyond the performance of a professional duty to serve\nthe client and [did not] involve a conspiracy to violate a legal duty\nin furtherance of the attorney\u2019s financial gain.\u2019\u201d In addition,\nWilliams\u2019s individual claim for conspiracy failed because the\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fcomplaint did not allege harm he suffered given that all of the\nfunds were allegedly embezzled from the Corporation.\n       Similarly, the complaint failed to state a cause of action for\nfinancial elder abuse because the complaint alleged\nembezzlement of money only from the Corporation, not from\nWilliams personally. Finally, the declaratory relief cause of\naction did not seek a declaration of rights to prevent a future\nbreach; rather, it sought redress for alleged past wrongs.\n       In their opposition, the Williams plaintiffs argued the\ncomplaint adequately alleged a conspiracy to embezzle funds, and\nthe Buchalter defendants were not insulated by the agent\u2019s\nimmunity rule because the complaint alleged tortious and\nfraudulent acts by Lucas that \u201cwent far beyond the performance\nof a professional duty to serve the client.\u201d (Capitalization\nomitted.) Financial elder abuse was actionable because Williams\nwas the sole shareholder of the Corporation, and \u201call the funds\ndeposited in the [the Corporation] were generated by his medical\npractice.\u201d The interests of Williams and the Corporation \u201cfully\ncoincide,\u201d and the two \u201cshould not be regarded as legally\ndistinct.\u201d Declaratory relief was proper because the complaint\nhad the prospective effect \u201cto stop any further misappropriation\nof the income\u201d from the medical practice. Finally, the one-year\nstatute of limitations in section 340.6 did not apply to the claims\nin the complaint because the complaint did not allege a cause of\naction for legal malpractice.\n       In their reply, the Buchalter defendants argued, in part,\nthat section 340.6 is not limited to claims for legal malpractice\nbut instead governs any claim, however styled, that depends on\nproof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fcourse of providing professional services, as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225 (Lee).\n       At the September 12, 2022 hearing on the demurrer, the\ntrial court announced its tentative ruling was to sustain the\ndemurrer without leave to amend.7 The court stated, \u201cI do think\nthe one-year statute of limitations applies based on the Lee\nversus Hanley case. And . . . according to your allegations you\ndiscovered the facts at the latest on February 17th of 2020, but\ndidn\u2019t file the suit until May 4th of 2022, which was over a year\nlater.\u201d After hearing argument of counsel, the court adopted its\ntentative ruling and sustained the demurrer to the causes of\naction for conspiracy, financial elder abuse, and declaratory relief\nwithout leave to amend.\n       On September 12, 2022 the trial court entered an order of\ndismissal in favor of the Buchalter defendants. The Williams\nplaintiffs timely appealed.8\n\n\n7     We previously deemed the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 September 1,\n2023 motion to augment the record to include the reporter\u2019s\ntranscript of the September 12, 2022 hearing as a motion to\ndesignate the record on appeal but deferred a ruling on the\nmotion. We now grant the motion.\n8      The Williams plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal states they are\nappealing from a judgment of dismissal after an order sustaining\na demurrer.

The Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the Demurrer Based\n       on the One-year Statute of Limitations Governing Attorney\n       Misconduct\n       Section 340.6, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part,\n\u201cAn action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,\nother than for actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services shall be commenced within one year after\nthe plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence\nshould have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or\nomission . . . .\u201d The Williams plaintiffs contend that contrary to\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply to their claims because the complaint alleges the Buchalter\ndefendants engaged in fraud and embezzlement. The Buchalter\ndefendants argue the claims against them arise solely from their\nperformance of legal services for their client, Petrosian, and the\n\u201cactual fraud\u201d exception in section 340, subdivision (a), does not\napply. The Williams plaintiffs have the better argument.9\n\n\n9     Because we find section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply, we do not reach the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 argument their\nclaims accrued later than February 2020 and were timely even\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f       In Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pages 1233 to 1236, the\nSupreme Court examined the scope of section 340.6,\nsubdivision (a), in considering whether the trial court properly\nsustained without leave to amend on statute of limitations\ngrounds the demurrer filed by an attorney (William Hanley) to\nthe complaint filed by his client (Nancy Lee) in an action to\nrecover unspent attorneys\u2019 fees where Lee alleged Hanley\nconverted the funds by refusing to return them after Lee\nterminated him. The Supreme Court held after examining the\nlegislative history that \u201csection 340.6(a)\u2019s time bar applies to\nclaims whose merits necessarily depend on proof that an attorney\nviolated a professional obligation in the course of providing\nprofessional services. In this context, a \u2018professional obligation\u2019 is\nan obligation that an attorney has by virtue of being an attorney,\nsuch as fiduciary obligations, the obligation to perform\ncompetently, the obligation to perform the services contemplated\nin a legal services contract into which an attorney has entered,\n\nunder a one-year limitations period. The statutes of limitations\napplicable here are all three years or longer: three years for\nconspiracy to commit fraud or embezzlement (\u00a7 338, subds. (c)(1),\n(d); see Filmservice Laboratories, Inc. v. Harvey Bernhard\nEnterprises, Inc. (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1297, 1309 [timeliness of\na civil conspiracy claim \u201cmust be determined by reference to the\nstatute of limitations applicable to the underlying cause of\naction\u201d]); four years for financial elder abuse (Welf. & Inst. Code,\n\u00a7 15657.7; Dennison v. Rosland Capital LLC (2020)\n47 Cal.App.5th 204, 212); and three or four years for declaratory\nrelief (Bank of New York Mellon v. Citibank, N.A. (2017)\n8 Cal.App.5th 935, 943 [\u201cA claim for declaratory relief is subject\nto the same statute of limitations as the legal or equitable claim\non which it is based.\u201d]). It is undisputed the complaint was filed\nwithin three years of accrual of the claims.\n\n\n\n                                 16\n\fand the obligations embodied in the Rules of Professional\nConduct.\u201d (Lee, at pp. 1236-1237.)\n      By contrast, the Lee court reasoned, \u201c[S]ection 340.6(a) does\nnot bar a claim for wrongdoing\u2014for example, garden-variety\ntheft\u2014that does not require proof that the attorney has violated a\nprofessional obligation, even if the theft occurs while the attorney\nand the victim are discussing the victim\u2019s legal affairs.\u201d (Lee,\nsupra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1237.) Moreover, section 340.6 does not\napply merely because an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201coccurs during\nthe period of legal representation or because the representation\nbrought the parties together and thus provided the attorney the\nopportunity to engage in the misconduct. . . . Nor does\nsection 340.6(a) necessarily apply whenever a plaintiff\u2019s\nallegations, if true, would entail a violation of an attorney\u2019s\nprofessional obligations. The obligations that an attorney has by\nvirtue of being an attorney are varied and often overlap with\nobligations that all persons subject to California\u2019s laws have. . . .\nFor purposes of section 340.6(a), . . . the question is whether the\nclaim, in order to succeed, necessarily depends on proof that an\nattorney violated a professional obligation as opposed to some\ngenerally applicable nonprofessional obligation.\u201d (Lee, at\np. 1238.)10\n\n10    The Supreme Court in Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at page 1236\nemphasized that section 340.6, subdivision (a), was designed \u201cso\nthat the applicable limitations period for such claims would turn\non the conduct alleged and ultimately proven, not on the way the\ncomplaint was styled,\u201d citing appellate decisions applying\nsection 340.6. subdivision (a), to malpractice-based claims against\nattorneys styled as claims for breach of fiduciary duty (e.g.,\nPrakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014)\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\f      Based on these principles, the Lee court held the trial court\nerred in sustaining the demurrer to Lee\u2019s complaint without\nleave to amend because although \u201cLee\u2019s allegations, if true, would\nshow that Hanley has violated certain professional obligations in\nthe course of providing professional services\u201d (and any claim\nbased on this violation would be time-barred), the complaint\ncould \u201calso be construed to allege a claim for conversion whose\nultimate proof at trial may not depend on the assertion that\nHanley violated a professional obligation. Thus, on at least one\nreasonable construction of the complaint, at least one of Lee\u2019s\nclaims is not time-barred.\u201d (Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 1229-\n1230; see id. at p. 1240 [\u201cOf course, Lee\u2019s allegations, if true, may\nalso establish that Hanley has violated certain professional\nobligations, such as the duty to refund unearned fees at the\ntermination of the representation (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct,\nrule 3-700(D)(2)), just as an allegation of garden-variety theft, if\ntrue, may also establish a violation of an attorney\u2019s duty to act\nwith loyalty and good faith toward a client.\u201d].)\n      The trial court here erred in finding the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Lee required application of section 340.6,\nsubdivision (a). The complaint, like the complaint in Lee, can be\nreasonably construed to allege Lucas violated obligations she\nowed to the Williams plaintiffs under California law not to\ndefraud them, and not simply her professional obligations as an\nattorney. The central allegations against the Buchalter\ndefendants are that Lucas \u201cknew of Petrosian\u2019s intent to own the\n\n223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1121-1122), malicious prosecution (e.g.,\nYee v. Cheung (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 184, 195-196), and breach\nof contract (e.g., Southland Mechanical Constructors Corp. v.\nNixen (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 417, 427).\n\n\n\n                                 18\n\fPractice, take all the profits and pay Dr. Williams some kind of\nsalary and, upon termination of the agreement, Petrosian\nintended to take over the Practice,\u201d and Lucas drafted the\nmanagement services agreement \u201cin a way to allow Petrosian to\nachieve her intended scheme.\u201d11 Specifically, Lucas knew\nWilliams had been misinformed by Petrosian that Lucas was\nrepresenting both parties, Lucas perpetuated the\nmispresentation during the April 12 meeting through her words\nand conduct, and she took advantage of the misrepresentation to\ninduce Williams to sign the management services agreements\nand to execute powers of attorney. Contrary to the argument by\nthe Buchalter defendants, the allegations that Lucas conspired\nwith Petrosian to deceive and defraud Williams go beyond the\nperformance of ordinary legal services.12\n\n\n\n\n11   Buchalter does not dispute its liability for Lucas\u2019s conduct\nunder principles of respondeat superior.\n12    The Buchalter defendants also argue that Williams\u2019s claims\nmust fail because the Buchalter defendants did not \u201cderive any\npersonal financial benefit from [their] legal work \u2018over and above\u2019\nand \u2018monetary compensation\u2019 that Buchalter received as payment\nfor professional services.\u201d But \u201c\u2018\u201c[i]t is not essential to liability\nthat the person charged with fraud should have received any\nbenefit therefrom.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Fort v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance\n(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 12, 19-20; accord, Lone Star Security &\nVideo, Inc. v. Bureau of Security & Investigative Services (2012)\n209 Cal.App.4th 445, 457.)\n\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f       Certainly, Lucas\u2019s alleged misconduct could constitute\nviolations of her professional obligations, \u201csuch as fiduciary\nobligations, the obligation to perform competently, the obligation\nto perform the services contemplated in a legal services\ncontract . . . and the obligations embodied in the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct\u201d (Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1237), and\nfurther, the misconduct occurred in the course of Lucas\u2019s legal\nrepresentation, which provided the opportunity to deceive\nWilliams (id. at p. 1238). But the Williams plaintiffs do not need\nto prove any professional violation to prevail. Rather, they have\nalleged a garden-variety fraudulent scheme. Indeed, the\ncomplaint would be essentially unchanged if Lucas were simply\nan actor who came to the April 12 meeting pretending to be a\nlawyer who would protect Williams\u2019s interests, while tricking\nWilliams into signing the agreement. This would be consistent\nwith the allegation in the complaint that Lucas\u2019s statements and\nconduct during the meeting led the Williams plaintiffs to believe\nshe drafted the management services agreement.\n       Moreover, as we discuss below, the first cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud adequately states a claim for intentional\nfraud; thus, even if the claim arose from the provision of legal\nservices, the claim falls within the \u201cactual fraud\u201d exception in\nsection 340.6. (See Quintilliani v. Mannerino (1998)\n62 Cal.App.4th 54, 69-70 [\u201cthe exception for actual fraud in\nsection 340.6 was intended to apply to intentional fraud, not\nconstructive fraud resulting from negligent misrepresentation\u201d];\naccord, Nguyen v. Ford (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 1, 17 [same].) The\nBuchalter defendants do not cite, and we are not aware of any,\ncase holding that an otherwise sufficient cause of action for\nintentional fraud by an attorney is subject to section 340.6\u2019s one-\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fyear statute of limitations. (Cf. Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1239\n[\u201cSection 340.6(a) applies to claims that necessarily depend on\nproof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the\ncourse of providing professional services unless the claim is for\nactual fraud.\u201d].)\n\nC.

To survive a\n\n\n\n                                 21\n\fdemurrer, a plaintiff must allege facts constituting each element\nof fraud with particularity. (Kalnoki v.

Superior Court (1989) 49 Cal.3d\n39, 44 (Doctors\u2019 Co.); accord, Favila, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at\np. 208.) In Doctors\u2019 Co., the Supreme Court held that the\nclaimant, whose malpractice claims against his doctor were\nsuccessfully tried to a jury, could not state a claim against the\nattorney for the doctor\u2019s insurer and the insurer\u2019s expert for\nconspiring with the insurer to violate an Insurance Code\n\n\nwas representing him lacks sufficient particularity, standing\nalone, to allege the inducement element, it is sufficient in\ncombination with the allegation that Lucas falsely advised\nWilliams that he had to sign the management services agreement\nand powers of attorney for Petrosian to manage the practice.\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fprovision requiring good faith efforts to settle a valid claim\n\u201c[b]ecause the noninsurer defendants [(the attorney and expert)]\nare not subject to that duty [under the Insurance Code] and were\nacting merely as agents of the insurer \u2018and not as individuals for\ntheir individual advantage.\u2019\u201d (Doctors\u2019 Co., at p. 45.) But the\ncourt clarified, \u201cIt remains true, of course, that under other sets of\ncircumstances \u2018[attorneys] may be liable for participation in\ntortious acts with their clients, and such liability may rest on a\nconspiracy\u2019 [citations]. For example, an attorney who conspires\nto cause a client to violate a statutory duty peculiar to the client\nmay be acting not only in the performance of a professional duty\nto serve the client but also in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s own\nfinancial gain.\u201d (Id. at p. 46.) Also, a claim may lie \u201cagainst an\nattorney for conspiring with his or her client to cause injury by\nviolating the attorney\u2019s own duty to the plaintiff.\u201d (Id. at p. 47.)\n       Shortly after the Supreme Court decided Doctors\u2019 Co., the\nLegislature amended Civil Code section 1714.10 (setting forth\nprefiling requirements for certain claims against an attorney\nalleging a civil conspiracy with his or her client) to add\nsubdivision (c), which sets forth the two exceptions to the agent\u2019s\nimmunity rule articulated in Doctors\u2019 Co. and provides that they\nare likewise exceptions to the prefiling requirements for civil\nconspiracy claims. Under subdivision (c), the prefiling\nrequirements do not apply to a cause of action \u201cagainst an\nattorney for a civil conspiracy with his or her client arising from\nany attempt to contest or compromise a claim or dispute\u201d where:\n\u201c(1) the attorney has an independent legal duty to the plaintiff, or\n(2) the attorney\u2019s acts go beyond the performance of a\n\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\fprofessional duty to serve the client and involve a conspiracy to\nviolate a legal duty in furtherance of the attorney\u2019s financial\ngain.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.10, subd. (c); see Favila, supra,\n188 Cal.App.4th at p. 209.)14\n       The allegations of the complaint are sufficient to establish\nthe conspiracy claim is not barred by the agent\u2019s immunity rule\nbecause Lucas (and Buchalter) had an independent legal duty not\nto defraud Williams. As discussed, the complaint alleges Lucas\nschemed to defraud the Williams plaintiffs by her statements and\nconduct at the April 12 meeting, which led Williams to believe\nshe represented him and Petrosian, and she induced Williams to\nbelieve the management services agreement and broad powers of\nattorney were necessary for Petrosian Esthetic to operate the\nmedical clinic. \u201cIt is well established that an attorney has an\nindependent legal duty to refrain from defrauding nonclients.\u201d\n(Rickley v. Goodfriend (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1136, 1151 [Civil\nCode section 1714.10 did not apply because attorneys had an\nindependent legal duty to third parties when holding client funds\nin a trust account with respect to dispersal of the funds to the\nclients and third parties]; see id. at p. 1153 [\u201cA license to practice\nlaw does not shield an attorney from liability when he or she\nengages in conduct that would be actionable if committed by a\nlayperson.

Hobbs actively participated in conduct that went\nway beyond the role of legal representative: self-help is not the\npractice of law.\u201d].)\n\nD.    Williams Fails To State an Individual Cause of Action for\n      Conspiracy To Defraud the Corporation\n      In their demurrer the Buchalter defendants argued, as they\ndo on appeal, that Williams cannot state an individual cause of\naction for conspiracy because the complaint does not allege any\nharm to him personally from the conspiracy: instead, the parties\nare alleged to have \u201cacted through their respective corporations,\u201d\nand all of the revenues and assets of the practice were taken from\nCorporation.15 The Williams plaintiffs did not address this\nargument in their opposition to the demurrer, and they do not\naddress it in their opening or reply briefs on appeal. They have\n\n\n15    The complaint includes a conclusory allegation that\nWilliams suffered \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d as a result of the\nBuchalter defendants\u2019 misconduct, seeking damages on that\nbasis. But there are no particularized allegations as to how the\nBuchalter defendants caused emotional distress and how the\ndistress manifested. In any event, the Williams plaintiffs do not\nargue the emotional distress allegation is sufficient to support an\nindividual claim.\n\n\n\n                                26\n\ftherefore forfeited this contention. (See Tiernan v. Trustees of\nCal. State University & Colleges (1982) 33 Cal.3d 211, 216, fn. 4\n[issue not raised on appeal \u201cdeemed waived\u201d]; Swain v.\nLaserAway Medical Group, Inc.

Although the trial court did not reach the issue,\nthe demurrer to Williams\u2019s individual cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud was properly sustained. (Carman v.\nAlvord, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 324.)\n\nE.     The Complaint Fails To State a Cause of Action for\n       Financial Elder Abuse\n       Financial elder abuse occurs when a person \u201c[t]akes,\nsecretes, appropriates, obtains or retains real or personal\nproperty of an elder,\u201d or assists in these activities, either \u201cfor a\nwrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both,\u201d or \u201cby undue\ninfluence.\u201d (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 15610.30, subds. (a)(1), (3).) An\n\u201c\u2018[e]lder\u2019\u201d is \u201cany person residing in this state, 65 years of age or\nolder.\u201d (Id., \u00a7 15610.27.)\n       The complaint fails to state a claim for financial elder\nabuse because it does not allege funds were taken from a person\nover 65\u2014as alleged, the unauthorized withdrawals, embezzled\nprofits, and misappropriated assets were all taken from the\nCorporation.16 \u201cIt is fundamental that a corporation is a legal\n\n16     There are circumstances in which the taking of property\nnot held directly by an elder may be actionable. (See Welf. &\nInst. Code, \u00a7 15610.30, subd. (c) [financial elder abuse occurs\n\u201cwhen an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property\nright . . . , regardless of whether the property is held directly or\nby a representative of an elder or dependent adult.\u201d].)

The Williams\nplaintiffs misapprehend the alter ego doctrine.\n       \u201c\u2018\u201cUnder the alter ego doctrine, . . . where a corporation is\nused by an individual or individuals, or by another corporation, to\nperpetrate fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other\nwrongful or inequitable purpose, a court may disregard the\ncorporate entity and treat the corporation\u2019s acts as if they were\ndone by the persons actually controlling the corporation.\u201d\u2019\u201d\n\n\na \u201c\u2018representative\u2019\u201d is narrowly defined as \u201ca person or entity that\nis either . . . : [\u00b6] (1) [a] conservator, trustee, or other\nrepresentative of the estate of an elder or dependent adult [or]\n[\u00b6] (2) [a]n attorney-in-fact of an elder or dependent adult who\nacts within the authority of the power of attorney.\u201d (Id.,\n\u00a7 15610.30, subd. (d).) The Corporation does not fall within this\ndefinition of a representative.\n\n\n\n                                28\n\f(Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v. Morgan Creek Productions, Inc.

(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1517-1518.) \u201cThus,\nalter ego is used to prevent a corporation from using its statutory\nseparate corporate form as a shield from liability only where to\nrecognize its corporate status would defeat the rights and\nequities of third parties; it is not a doctrine that allows the\npersons who actually control the corporation to disregard the\ncorporate form.\u201d (Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995)\n35 Cal.App.4th 980, 994; accord, Butler America, LLC v. Aviation\nAssurance Co. LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 136, 147.)\n       As alleged, Williams and Petrosian \u201cdecided to act through\ntheir respective corporations,\u201d and the Buchalter defendants\nfraudulently induced Williams to enter into the management\nservices agreements and execute powers of attorney on behalf of\nthe Corporation. The Petrosian defendants withdrew money\nfrom the Corporation\u2019s bank accounts, overbilled the Corporation\nfor management services and reimbursements, and claimed\nownership of the Corporation\u2019s assets. The complaint does not\nallege the Corporation is Williams\u2019s alter ego, and the fact\nWilliams was the sole owner of the Corporation does not make\nthe Corporation his alter ego, let alone bring a corporation within\nthe scope of the elder abuse law.\n\nF.     The Complaint Fails To State a Cause of Action for\n       Declaratory Relief Against the Buchalter Defendants\n       \u201c\u2018A complaint for declaratory relief is legally sufficient if it\nsets forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy\nrelating to the legal rights and duties of the parties under a\nwritten instrument or with respect to property and requests that\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fthe rights and duties of the parties be adjudged by the court.\u2019\u201d\n(Market Lofts Community Assn. v. 9th Street Market Lofts, LLC\n(2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 924, 931.) \u201c\u2018Declaratory relief operates\nprospectively, serving to set controversies at rest. If there is a\ncontroversy which calls for a declaration of rights, it is no\nobjection that past wrongs are also to be redressed; but there is\nno basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are\ninvolved.\u2019\u201d (Baldwin v. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1978)\n79 Cal.App.3d 393, 407; accord, Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor &\nAssociates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1403.) The remedy of\ndeclaratory relief is unavailable where a \u201cplaintiff has a fully\nmatured cause of action for money, if any cause exists at all.\u201d\n(Jackson v. Teachers Ins. Co. (1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 341, 344;\naccord, Canova v. Trustees of Imperial Irrigation Dist. Employee\nPension Plan (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1497 [\u201cWhere, as\nhere, a party has a fully matured cause of action for money, the\nparty must seek the remedy of damages, and not pursue a\ndeclaratory relief claim.\u201d].)\n       The complaint alleges the Petrosian defendants, aided by\nthe Buchalter defendants, embezzled money from the\nCorporation and, after the April 30, 2020 termination of the\nrelationship, used the management services agreements to\nexclude Williams and take over the practice. The declaratory\nrelief cause of action alleges a controversy exists \u201cbetween the\nPlaintiffs and the Petrosian Defendants\u201d (a defined term in the\ncomplaint that does not include the Buchalter defendants)\nbecause the Williams plaintiffs contend they sustained losses of\n$11.5 million, they own the practice, including the leases,\nequipment, and intangible property, and they \u201care entitled to all\n\n\n\n\n                                30\n\fthe income generated from the [p]ractice since May 1, 2020,\u201d\nwhereas the defendants dispute those contentions.\n      The complaint therefore fails to allege an actual\ncontroversy respecting prospective rights between the Williams\nplaintiffs and the Buchalter defendants. The Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 alleged role in defrauding the Corporation may be\nredressed with damages. To the extent there is a prospective\ndispute about ownership of the practice and future revenues it\nmay generate, this dispute lies with the Petrosian defendants,\nnot the Buchalter defendants.

(the Corporation;\ncollectively, the Williams plaintiffs), appeal from an order of\ndismissal entered as to defendants Buchalter APC and Carol\nLucas (collectively, the Buchalter defendants) after the trial\ncourt sustained without leave to amend the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint. The Williams plaintiffs\nasserted causes of action for conspiracy to defraud, financial elder\nabuse, and declaratory relief against the Buchalter defendants\nbased on allegations that Lucas, an attorney and shareholder at\nBuchalter, conspired with Sevana Petrosian, who was Williams\u2019s\nbusiness partner and managed several medical clinics where\nWilliams conducted his medical practice, to deceive Williams into\nbelieving Buchalter represented him and to induce him to enter\ncontracts that allowed Petrosian to embezzle more than $11\nmillion dollars from the Corporation. In sustaining the\ndemurrer, the trial court found all claims against the Buchalter\ndefendants were barred by the one-year statute of limitations\ngoverning claims against an attorney \u201cfor a wrongful act or\nomission, other than actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 340.6, subdivision (a).2\n\n\n\n\n1     Williams died during the pendency of this appeal. On\nMay 12, 2023 we granted the motion of his widow Gail Dee Lew-\nWilliams to be substituted in place of Williams as his successor in\ninterest.\n2    All further undesignated statutory references are to the\nCode of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\f      On appeal, the Williams plaintiffs contend the one-year\nstatute of limitations under section 340.6, subdivision (a), does\nnot apply to their claims because the gravamen of their action is\nactual fraud. We agree the complaint sufficiently alleged the\nBuchalter defendants conspired to commit actual fraud, such that\nsection 340.6 does not apply and the Corporation\u2019s conspiracy\ncause of action survives demurrer. However, Williams\u2019s\nindividual conspiracy claim fails because, as alleged, only the\nCorporation was defrauded. Moreover, the complaint fails to\nstate claims for financial elder abuse and declaratory relief.\n      We reverse the order of dismissal and the order sustaining\nthe demurrer and direct the trial court to enter a new order\noverruling the demurrer to the Corporation\u2019s cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud and sustaining without leave to amend the\ndemurrer to the Corporation\u2019s remaining causes of action and\nWilliams\u2019s cause of action for conspiracy to defraud.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Complaint\n      The Williams plaintiffs filed this action on May 4, 2022\nagainst the Buchalter defendants and Petrosian, her associates\nSalina Ranjbar, Vana Mehrabian, and Staforde Palmer,\nPetrosian\u2019s wholly owned company Petrosian Esthetic\nEnterprises LLC (Petrosian Esthetic), and seven limited liability\ncompanies Petrosian formed to operate individual medical spas\nunder the name \u201cSEV Laser Aesthetics\u201d (the SEV companies;\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fcollectively, the Petrosian defendants).3 The complaint alleged\nsix causes of action, three of which were asserted against Lucas\nor the Buchalter defendants: the first cause of action for\nconspiracy to defraud, the third cause of action for financial elder\nabuse, and the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief.4\n\n3      On September 22, 2021 the Williams plaintiffs filed a\npetition, including a draft complaint, seeking court approval to\nfile an action against the Buchalter defendants for civil\nconspiracy with a client pursuant to Civil Code section 1714.10.\n(Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Carol Lucas, et al. (Super.\nCt. Los Angeles County, 2021, No. 20STCP03133).) On February\n3, 2022 the trial court found the alleged conspiracy to defraud the\nWilliams plaintiffs arose from \u201ctransactional activities\u201d carried\nout by the Buchalter defendants and did not arise \u201cfrom any\nattempt to contest or compromise a claim or dispute\u201d within the\nscope of Civil Code section 1714.10, subdivision (a), and therefore\nthe Williams plaintiffs could file their complaint without\nobtaining court approval.\n4      The complaint also asserted causes of action for breach of\ncontract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\nand conspiracy to defraud against one or more of the Petrosian\ndefendants. The allegations asserted against these defendants\noverlap with allegations by the Williams plaintiffs in the related\nactions Wilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Sevana Petrosian, et\nal. (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV14137) and\nWilbur Williams, Jr., M.D., et al. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n(Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2020, No. 20STCV15993).\n      The Buchalter defendants request we take judicial notice of\nthe Los Angeles Superior Court online case summaries for these\nrelated actions for the purpose of establishing the date on which\nthe actions were filed. The Buchalter defendants made a similar\nrequest in the trial court that the court take judicial notice of\nvarious pleadings in the related actions, but the court did not\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f       As alleged in the complaint, in late 2013 Williams and\nPetrosian entered into discussions for Petrosian to act as the non-\nmedical manager of medical spas where Williams would conduct\nhis practice. Williams was then 77 years old and in apparent\npoor health. Williams and Petrosian \u201cdecided to act through\ntheir respective corporations.\u201d Williams\u2019s longstanding\naccountant, Leila Aquino, met with Petrosian to discuss the\npreparation of a contract that would govern the parties\u2019\narrangement and suggested a few law firms to assist them.\nHowever, Petrosian stated she already had contacted a lawyer,\nlater identified as Lucas, \u201cwho agreed to represent both parties\nand prepare a contract that is fair to both parties.\u201d Petrosian set\nup a meeting with Lucas.\n       On April 12, 2014 Williams and Aquino met with Petrosian\nand Lucas at Buchalter\u2019s offices (April 12 meeting). Lucas did\nnot tell Williams that she did not represent him, nor did she ask\nhim if he was represented by counsel. Lucas\u2019s statements and\nconduct during the meeting led Williams and Aquino \u201cto believe\nPetrosian\u2019s representations to them, that Lucas represented both\nParties and prepared a fair contract.\u201d Lucas never disclosed that\nshe had been representing Petrosian for over a year.\n\n\n\n\nrule on their request. We deny the request to take judicial notice\nof any trial court records in the related actions because the\nrecords are not relevant to our resolution of this appeal. Because\nwe find the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 claims were filed within the\napplicable statute of limitations, we do not reach the Buchalter\ndefendants\u2019 arguments that the pleadings in the related actions\ncontain admissions bearing on accrual of the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      During the meeting, Lucas had in front of her a\n\u201cManagement Services Agreement\u201d that she referred to a few\ntimes. She briefly explained to Williams that the laws governing\nthe corporate practice of medicine prohibit non-physicians from\nowning a medical practice, and then she \u201cimmediately moved to\nconvince and advise Dr. Williams to grant [Petrosian Esthetic] a\npower of attorney and Petrosian the right to sign checks and to\npay bills,\u201d explaining this would be necessary for Petrosian\nEsthetic to operate a clinic, collect patient payments, and make\nbank deposits on behalf of Williams\u2019s medical practice. \u201cIn\nreliance on Petrosian\u2019s representation that Lucas represented\nboth Parties and prepared a fair contract, reinforced by Lucas\u2019s\nconduct and statements during the meeting,\u201d on April 12, 2014\nWilliams signed the management services agreement without\nreading it.\n      A copy of the executed management services agreement\nbetween the Corporation and Petrosian Esthetic was attached to\nthe complaint. The recitals state the Corporation \u201cdesires to\nengage the services of [Petrosian Esthetic] to perform certain\nnon-professional functions for [the Corporation], in order to\npermit [the Corporation] to concentrate its efforts on the\nPractice.\u201d\u2019 The \u201cPractice\u201d was defined as the provision of medical\ncosmetic services at medical spa locations in Glendale and West\nHollywood. Under the agreement, the Corporation appointed\nPetrosian Esthetic as its attorney-in-fact for a wide range of non-\nmedical functions, including collecting payments, making\ndeposits, and other banking functions on the account of the\nCorporation (including making payments to Petrosian Esthetic\nfor management services and expenses). Petrosian Esthetic was\nresponsible for providing numerous services on behalf of the\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fCorporation with respect to the practice, including accounting,\nfinancial, and legal services, the employment of non-physician\npersonnel, providing and maintaining furniture, fixtures and\nequipment, and marketing. The agreement also provided\nPetrosian Esthetic would sublease space to the Corporation.\nUnder the agreement, a copy of any notices served pursuant to\nthe agreement would be sent to the attention of Lucas at\nBuchalter\u2019s Los Angeles office.\n      The complaint alleged on information and belief that \u201cfrom\nthe onset Lucas knew of Petrosian\u2019s intent to own the Practice,\ntake all the profits and pay Dr. Williams some kind of salary and,\nupon termination of the agreement, Petrosian intended to take\nover the Practice,\u201d and Lucas drafted the management services\nagreement \u201cin a way to allow Petrosian to achieve her intended\nscheme.\u201d\n      Beginning in 2016 the medical practice expanded to seven\nnew clinic locations, and Lucas, on behalf of Petrosian, formed\nand registered the SEV companies, one for each new location.\nEach of the SEV companies then entered into a management\nservices agreement with the Corporation regarding Williams\u2019s\nmedical practice at the individual locations. Relying on\nPetrosian\u2019s representation that the seven management services\nagreement were identical to the April 12, 2014 management\nservices agreement and that they were prepared by Lucas,\nWilliams signed each agreement on behalf of the Corporation,\nagain without reading the agreements. Each of the management\nservices agreements provided that the respective SEV company\nwould be entitled to actual out-of-pocket costs in providing\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fmanagement services plus a management fee of 15 percent of\nthose costs.5\n       In January 2020 the Corporation received a tax form from\nits credit card processing company indicating the practice had\ncollected credit card payments exceeding $7.5 million in 2019,\nalthough in 2019 the Williams plaintiffs had only received\n$155,000 from the Petrosian defendants. Petrosian had claimed\nthe $155,000 was the net profit from operations. Williams was\nsurprised by the disparity and consulted an attorney in February\n2020. With the help of an accountant, Williams reviewed the\nCorporation\u2019s bank records and determined gross income to the\nCorporation during 2019 exceeded $10.2 million, with estimated\nprofits of about $6 million.\n       On February 17, 2020 the parties mutually agreed to\nterminate their relationship effective April 30, 2020. Following\nthe termination, Petrosian allegedly \u201ctook over\u201d the entire\npractice, including the equipment, patients and employees,\nwithout compensating Williams, and she denied Williams access\nto the clinics. The Petrosian defendants relied on a provision of\nthe management services agreements to claim ownership of the\npractice.6\n\n\n5     A copy of the October 29, 2018 management services\nagreement between the Corporation and SEV Laser Aesthetics-\nSan Jose, LLC was attached to the complaint as an example of\nthe post-2018 management services agreements the Corporation\nentered into with the SEV companies.\n6     Paragraph 4.8 of the management services agreement\nprovides, \u201c[Petrosian Esthetic] has the legal right to occupy the\nspace occupied by the Practice . . . and grants to [Corporation] the\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f        The Williams plaintiffs calculated that between January 1,\n2017 and March 31, 2020, the practice generated gross revenues\nof about $20 million, with estimated overhead of $8 million, but\nthey only received about $400,000 in purported net profits during\nthis period. The complaint alleges on this basis the Petrosian\ndefendants embezzled about $11.4 million from the Corporation.\n       Moreover, in early 2020 the Petrosian defendants withdrew\nabout $2.2 million from the Corporation\u2019s bank accounts,\nincluding more than $700,000 in cash withdrawals. In response\nto an inquiry from the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 attorney about the\nwithdrawals, Lucas stated the funds were charged by Petrosian\nas a \u201clicense fee,\u201d and Lucas produced a set of agreements\nexecuted in 2019 between the SEV companies and Petrosian\nEsthetic under which each SEV company licensed the intellectual\nproperty relating to the \u201cSEV Laser\u201d brand from Petrosian\nEsthetic. Williams was previously unaware of these agreements,\nunder which the Petrosian defendants collected $2.1 million a\nyear in intellectual property license fees.\n       Lucas denied ever representing Williams or the\nCorporation, and she denied preparing the management services\nagreements. Lucas also claimed Buchalter had never billed the\nCorporation for legal services. However, in 2017 Petrosian\nEsthetic paid nearly $8,000 to Buchalter, and in 2018 two of the\nSEV companies paid nearly $30,000 in \u201clegal fees\u201d to the firm.\nThus, \u201cLucas has been paid dozens of thousands of dollars every\nyear by the [p]ractice of Dr Williams, at the same time Lucas was\n\n\n\n\nright to use the Premises for the Practice for as long as this\nAgreement remains in effect (the \u2018Sublease\u2019).\u201d\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fconspiring with Petrosian against Dr. Williams and his\n[p]ractice.\u201d\n      The first cause of action for conspiracy to defraud sought to\nvoid the management services agreements based on Lucas\u2019s and\nPetrosian\u2019s false inducements to cause Williams to enter the\nagreements; damages exceeding $11 million for the\nembezzlement of Corporation funds pursuant to the agreements\nand the overbroad powers of attorney granted to the Petrosian\ndefendants therein; damages for the severe emotional distress\nWilliams suffered as a result of the defendants\u2019 scheme; punitive\nand exemplary damages based on the defendants\u2019 malice; and\nenhanced damages pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 15657.5.\n      The third cause of action for financial elder abuse pursuant\nto Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610 is based on the\nsame factual allegations regarding the Buchalter defendants\u2019\nconduct. The sixth cause of action for declaratory relief, although\nasserted against both the Buchalter defendants and the\nPetrosian defendants, alleges \u201c[a]n actual controversy exists\nbetween Plaintiffs and the [Petrosian defendants]. Plaintiffs\ncontend that the [Petrosian defendants] should be held liable for\nPlaintiffs losses of about $11.5 million. Plaintiffs also contend\nthat they own the Practice, the leases to the clinics, the\nequipment and the electronic communication, as well as the\nwebsite. Plaintiffs also contend that they are entitled to all the\nincome generated from the Practice since May 1, 2020.\nDefendants contend otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fB.     The Buchalter Defendants\u2019 Demurrer and the Trial Court\u2019s\n       Order\n       On July 15, 2022 the Buchalter defendants demurred to all\ncauses of action in the complaint. They argued the claims\nagainst them were barred under the one-year statute of\nlimitations in section 340.6, subdivision (a), which governs claims\n\u201cfor a wrongful act or omission, other than actual fraud, arising\nin the performance of professional services\u201d by an attorney. They\nasserted that, as alleged in the complaint, the Williams plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims accrued no later than February 17, 2020, when the parties\nagreed to terminate their relationship based on disputes over\npayments to the Corporation, but the claims against the\nBuchalter defendants were not filed until May 2022.\n       The Buchalter defendants also argued with respect to the\nconspiracy cause of action that the Williams plaintiffs failed to\nsufficiently allege the Buchalter defendants were aware of, or\nknowingly agreed to a \u201c\u2018common and unlawful plan\u2019\u201d to embezzle\nmoney from the Williams plaintiffs. Rather, \u201c[t]hey simply allege\nthat Buchalter performed legal services\u2014such as forming LLCs,\nparticipating in an exchange of information regarding a proposed\nbusiness arrangement during an April 12, 2014 meeting, and\ndrafting agreements\u2014for its client, Sevana Petrosian.\u201d\nMoreover, the \u201cagent\u2019s immunity rule\u201d shielded the Buchalter\ndefendants from liability for acts of misconduct performed as an\nagent of Petrosian, because the Buchalter defendants did not owe\nan independent legal duty to Williams, and further, their acts did\nnot \u201c\u2018go beyond the performance of a professional duty to serve\nthe client and [did not] involve a conspiracy to violate a legal duty\nin furtherance of the attorney\u2019s financial gain.\u2019\u201d In addition,\nWilliams\u2019s individual claim for conspiracy failed because the\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fcomplaint did not allege harm he suffered given that all of the\nfunds were allegedly embezzled from the Corporation.\n       Similarly, the complaint failed to state a cause of action for\nfinancial elder abuse because the complaint alleged\nembezzlement of money only from the Corporation, not from\nWilliams personally. Finally, the declaratory relief cause of\naction did not seek a declaration of rights to prevent a future\nbreach; rather, it sought redress for alleged past wrongs.\n       In their opposition, the Williams plaintiffs argued the\ncomplaint adequately alleged a conspiracy to embezzle funds, and\nthe Buchalter defendants were not insulated by the agent\u2019s\nimmunity rule because the complaint alleged tortious and\nfraudulent acts by Lucas that \u201cwent far beyond the performance\nof a professional duty to serve the client.\u201d (Capitalization\nomitted.) Financial elder abuse was actionable because Williams\nwas the sole shareholder of the Corporation, and \u201call the funds\ndeposited in the [the Corporation] were generated by his medical\npractice.\u201d The interests of Williams and the Corporation \u201cfully\ncoincide,\u201d and the two \u201cshould not be regarded as legally\ndistinct.\u201d Declaratory relief was proper because the complaint\nhad the prospective effect \u201cto stop any further misappropriation\nof the income\u201d from the medical practice. Finally, the one-year\nstatute of limitations in section 340.6 did not apply to the claims\nin the complaint because the complaint did not allege a cause of\naction for legal malpractice.\n       In their reply, the Buchalter defendants argued, in part,\nthat section 340.6 is not limited to claims for legal malpractice\nbut instead governs any claim, however styled, that depends on\nproof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fcourse of providing professional services, as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Lee v.

The Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the Demurrer Based\n       on the One-year Statute of Limitations Governing Attorney\n       Misconduct\n       Section 340.6, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part,\n\u201cAn action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,\nother than for actual fraud, arising in the performance of\nprofessional services shall be commenced within one year after\nthe plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence\nshould have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or\nomission . . . .\u201d The Williams plaintiffs contend that contrary to\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling, section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply to their claims because the complaint alleges the Buchalter\ndefendants engaged in fraud and embezzlement. The Buchalter\ndefendants argue the claims against them arise solely from their\nperformance of legal services for their client, Petrosian, and the\n\u201cactual fraud\u201d exception in section 340, subdivision (a), does not\napply. The Williams plaintiffs have the better argument.9\n\n\n9     Because we find section 340.6, subdivision (a), does not\napply, we do not reach the Williams plaintiffs\u2019 argument their\nclaims accrued later than February 2020 and were timely even\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f       In Lee, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pages 1233 to 1236, the\nSupreme Court examined the scope of section 340.6,\nsubdivision (a), in considering whether the trial court properly\nsustained without leave to amend on statute of limitations\ngrounds the demurrer filed by an attorney (William Hanley) to\nthe complaint filed by his client (Nancy Lee) in an action to\nrecover unspent attorneys\u2019 fees where Lee alleged Hanley\nconverted the funds by refusing to return them after Lee\nterminated him. The Supreme Court held after examining the\nlegislative history that \u201csection 340.6(a)\u2019s time bar applies to\nclaims whose merits necessarily depend on proof that an attorney\nviolated a professional obligation in the course of providing\nprofessional services. In this context, a \u2018professional obligation\u2019 is\nan obligation that an attorney has by virtue of being an attorney,\nsuch as fiduciary obligations, the obligation to perform\ncompetently, the obligation to perform the services contemplated\nin a legal services contract into which an attorney has entered,\n\nunder a one-year limitations period. The statutes of limitations\napplicable here are all three years or longer: three years for\nconspiracy to commit fraud or embezzlement (\u00a7 338, subds.

Moreover, section 340.6 does not\napply merely because an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201coccurs during\nthe period of legal representation or because the representation\nbrought the parties together and thus provided the attorney the\nopportunity to engage in the misconduct. . . . Nor does\nsection 340.6(a) necessarily apply whenever a plaintiff\u2019s\nallegations, if true, would entail a violation of an attorney\u2019s\nprofessional obligations.

BACKGROUND\n\n       Mr. Vasquez-Castro is a citizen of Guatemala. He was born in Guatemala in\n\n July 1993. When Mr. Vasquez-Castro was approximately fifteen years old, his family\n\n asked whether he was willing to live and work with one of his brothers in the United\n\n States. Mr. Vasquez-Castro agreed to move, although he does not remember who\n\n brought him to the United States without inspection. Mr. Vasquez-Castro reportedly\n\n lived in Memphis, Tennessee, for three years before moving to Dodge City, Kansas,\n\n with his brother and his brother\u2019s family.\n\n       In 2017, Mr. Vasquez-Castro was convicted of attempted rape of his twelve-\n\n year-old niece. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in the instant case\n\n provides that, in April 2017, a faculty member at Dodge City Middle School\n\n contacted the police to report allegations of sexual assault made by a female student.\n\n According to an official affidavit, the defendant kissed his twelve-year-old niece on\n\n the mouth, tried to take off her shirt, touched her breasts, and touched her vagina\n\n beneath her clothing. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then bought the victim a cell phone and\n\n told her not to tell anyone about the incident. Mr. Vasquez-Castro was arrested and\n\n interviewed by the police, at which point he admitted to forcing a kiss on the victim,\n\n grabbing her by the arms, and holding her still, while he tried to lift her shirt. He\n\n stated he used his hands to feel the victim\u2019s belly, breast, and front torso, and\n\n subsequently touched the victim under her clothing, touching her breasts and vagina.\n\n He then digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina. He reported he gained an erection\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01/19/2024       Page: 3\n\n\n\n from this, but let the victim go because he wanted to have sex with her and knew it\n\n was wrong.\n\n        Later, in November 2017, during an evaluation with the Kansas Department of\n\n Corrections, Mr. Vasquez-Castro denied the incident and stated he only gave the\n\n victim a cell phone. He admitted to telling the police he touched the victim in a\n\n sexually inappropriate manner, but stated he admitted to having done so because the\n\n police repeatedly asked him the same question and Mr. Vasquez-Castro thought that\n\n by admitting to the incident, the police would let him go. He alleged the victim\n\n engaged in sexual behavior with a friend with the same name as Mr. Vasquez-Castro.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro was charged with attempted rape in Kansas state court and\n\n pleaded no contest to the charge. The standard presumptive sentence for the offense\n\n was 59 months of incarceration. However, the court sentenced him to 48 months\u2019\n\n incarceration, departing downward based on the victim\u2019s request, Mr. Vasquez-\n\n Castro\u2019s age, and Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s criminal history. He was subsequently\n\n deported from the United States on October 21, 2020.\n\n        On October 8, 2022, United States Border Patrol agents found\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro, in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico, attempting to conceal\n\n himself. He admitted to being a citizen of Guatemala without legal authorization to\n\n enter or remain in the United States. Mr. Vazquez was charged with reentry of a\n\n removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). He entered a\n\n guilty plea.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024       Page: 4\n\n\n\n       The PSR calculated Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s total offense level as 13 and his\n\n criminal history category as III, resulting in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 18 to\n\n 24 months. Neither party objected to the PSR. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a low-\n\n end Guidelines sentence, or downward variance, asserting that such a sentence would\n\n be sufficient. The Government opposed Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s request and asked that\n\n the court sentence Mr. Vasquez-Castro at the high end of the Guidelines range. The\n\n district court notified the parties before sentencing that it was contemplating an\n\n upward variance.\n\n       The district court sentenced Mr. Vasquez-Castro on April 11, 2023. The court\n\n reiterated at the sentencing hearing that it was considering an upward variance. The\n\n Government stated its position that a high-end sentence of 24 months would be\n\n sufficient to protect the public and deter Mr. Vasquez-Castro from returning to the\n\n United States again. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a sentence on the lower end or\n\n below the Guidelines range, arguing through counsel that he had been a model\n\n prisoner, he has family in his home country, he was very isolated at the time of his\n\n 2017 conviction, his relationship with his twelve-year-old niece was not sexual in\n\n nature, and he pleaded guilty to molesting her because he was frightened of getting a\n\n more severe sentence. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then addressed the court directly. He\n\n apologized for entering the country illegally, explained that he had gotten married\n\n and had a child since he was deported in 2020, and stated that he returned to the\n\n United States in search of employment to provide for his family. He requested the\n\n opportunity to be reunited with his wife and child. At the district court\u2019s request,\n\n                                             4\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024     Page: 5\n\n\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro then explained the events leading up to his 2017 conviction,\n\n reiterating that he never had a sexual relationship with his niece.\n\n       The district court then described the facts it was considering in determining an\n\n appropriate sentence for Mr. Vasquez-Castro. The court noted that it was\n\n \u201cconsidering all [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] arguments,\u201d including that he \u201cwas coming\n\n to [the] United States to work, that economic circumstances in his home country are\n\n very difficult, and he has a family to support; [his] argument made in his motion that\n\n his travel to the United States was very difficult, including having to pay human\n\n smugglers; [and] that [he] speaks Spanish[.]\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. VI at 16\u201317. The court\n\n did not find \u201cany [of] these factors merit a lower sentencing, given [Mr. Vasquez-\n\n Castro\u2019s] behavior while in the United States committing now his second felony in\n\n the United States.\u201d Id. at 17.\n\n       The district court also \u201cconsider[ed] that [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] denies sexually\n\n assaulting the 12-year-old victim in his prior State case, even though [he] admitted to\n\n at least some of the . . . allegations against him.\u201d Id. The court considered\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument \u201cthat he was young when he committed these State\n\n crimes and he was culturally isolated,\u201d although the court \u201cnote[d] that\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] came to live in the United States with his older brother and\n\n was a member of a church which apparently had other Guatemalans in it, so he was\n\n not completely isolated; he had family and church surrounding him.\u201d Id. The district\n\n court also \u201cconsider[ed] [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] argument that he has worked at the\n\n detention center and that he\u2019s a model prisoner and that the State will extradite\n\n                                             5\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01/19/2024    Page: 6\n\n\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] for his State crime,\u201d as well as \u201c[his] argument that he has\n\n family in his home country that supports him\u201d and \u201cfamily here in the U.S. that\n\n supports him as well.\u201d Id.\n\n       The court noted it was considering \u201cthe argument that [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] is\n\n innocent of the crime against the little girl and that he pled because he was frightened\n\n and this was actually just some confusion about a child having a cell phone\u201d and\n\n \u201cthat the victim in that case may have asked for less time, which is why\n\n [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] only got a 48-month sentence in his State case.\u201d Id. at 17\u201318.\n\n The court also considered that the Government was asking for a higher-end sentence.\n\n       The district court considered Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s history and the nature and\n\n circumstances of the offense, noting that his history \u201cincludes a 2017 conviction for\n\n attempted rape where [he] molested his 12-year-old step-niece.\u201d Id. at 18. The court\n\n considered \u201cthat this offense is of [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] returning to the country in\n\n which he committed this serious crime while still on probation for that crime,\n\n returning only two years after his release for the State sentence.\u201d Id.\n\n       The district court also considered \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to\n\n provide just punishment, respect for the law, adequate deterrence, and protection of\n\n the public.\u201d1 Id.

The court explained that it was \u201cnot re-punishing him for his State crime or\n\n trying to make up for a lenient sentence in his State court [case],\u201d and instead was\n\n \u201cjust noting that the lenient sentence in his prior case did not prevent him from\n\n coming to the United States so quickly upon release; thereby committing another\n\n felony\u201d and \u201cconsidering the need to protect the public\u201d because Mr. Vasquez-Castro\n\n \u201cha[d] shown his ability to molest children.\u201d Id. Thus, district court concluded that\n\n \u201cjust punishment requires the Court to give a higher-than-Guideline[s] sentence\n\n because [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] reentered the country illegally after having committed\n\n a very serious crime while in the country\u201d and \u201che was released from prison on that\n\n crime only about two years before he committed this crime.\u201d Id.\n\n        The court also \u201cconsider[ed] the kinds of sentences available, sentencing\n\n range, and the Guideline[s] policies\u201d and \u201cthe need[] to avoid unwarranted\n\n sentencing disparities.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320. It explained that Mr. Vasquez-Castro \u201creceived\n\n a somewhat lower sentence for his prior sex offense, a lower sentence than . . . most\n\n defendants are given,\u201d thus finding that \u201cthis sentence, in part, will avoid\n\n unwarranted sentencing disparities because many defendants would have received a\n\n higher sentence.\u201d Id. at 20. All the same, \u201cif there is any sentencing disparity,\u201d the\n\n court found that such a disparity \u201cis, in fact, warranted by the facts in this case.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01/19/2024       Page: 8\n\n\n\n       The court then sentenced Mr. Vasquez-Castro to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n This represented an upward variance from the Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months.\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro timely appealed, challenging the substantive reasonableness of\n\n the sentence imposed.\n\n                                II.      DISCUSSION\n\n                                A.     Standard of Review\n\n        \u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the\n\n Guidelines range, [we] must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion\n\n standard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). The substantive\n\n reasonableness of a sentence centers on \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is\n\n reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in\n\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d United States v. Conlan, 500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n The factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\n\n defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the\n\n seriousness of the crime, deter future criminal conduct, protect the public from the\n\n defendant\u2019s further crimes, and provide training, medical care, or rehabilitation;\n\n (3) the sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines; (5) the Sentencing\n\n Commission\u2019s policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n disparities; and (7) the need for restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); see also United\n\n States v. Barnes, 890 F.3d 910, 915 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\n       \u201cWe give substantial deference to the district court\u2019s weighing of these\n\n factors.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 915. Thus, \u201c[w]e do not reweigh the sentencing factors\n\n                                             8\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353         Date Filed: 01/19/2024      Page: 9\n\n\n\n but instead ask whether the sentence fell within the range of rationally available\n\n choices that [the] facts and the law at issue can fairly support.\u201d United States v. Blair,\n\n 933 F.3d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). We \u201cwill\n\n only overturn a sentence that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly\n\n unreasonable,\u201d United States v. Williams, 994 F.3d 1176, 1180 (10th Cir. 2021)\n\n (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       \u201cIf [the district court] decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is\n\n warranted, [it] must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\n\n justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d Gall,\n\n 552 U.S. at 50. \u201c[A] major departure should be supported by a more significant\n\n justification than a minor one.\u201d Id.; see also United States v. Lente, 759 F.3d 1149,\n\n 1158 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201cA \u2018major\u2019 variance should have \u2018a more significant\n\n justification than a minor one.\u2019\u201d (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 50)). All the same, while\n\n we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation,\u201d we \u201cmay not apply a presumption of\n\n unreasonableness.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. To the contrary, \u201cwe uphold even\n\n substantial variances when the district court properly weighs the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\n\n and offers valid reasons for the chosen sentence.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 916. \u201cStill, we\n\n do not just provide a rubber stamp of approval and therefore must determine if the\n\n district court\u2019s proffered rationale, on aggregate, justifies the magnitude of the\n\n sentence.\u201d United States v. Walker, 74 F.4th 1163, 1202 (10th Cir. 2023) (internal\n\n quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024    Page: 10\n\n\n\n                                       B.   Application\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro asserts that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.\n\n  He argues the district court abused its discretion when it varied upward from the\n\n  Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months and sentenced him to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n  Specifically, Mr. Vasquez-Castro claims \u201c[t]here was insufficient cause to issue an\n\n  upward variance and the sentence was otherwise substantively unreasonable,\u201d\n\n  arguing the district court did not properly weigh the mitigating factors Mr. Vasquez-\n\n  Castro identified. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He also asserts the district court \u201cmyopically\n\n  focused\u201d on his 2017 conviction. Id.\n\n        Failure to Consider Mitigating Factors\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro first asserts the district court did not consider the\n\n  mitigating factors in this case. He notes there was nothing aggravating about the\n\n  conduct in the instant offense. Additionally, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues the district\n\n  court did not properly consider his personal history and the circumstances of this\n\n  case, including that he has been a model prisoner and has family to support in\n\n  Guatemala. Mr. Vasquez-Castro also notes that he was here for economic reasons, he\n\n  did not commit any new crimes while in the United States, this is his first\n\n  immigration offense, he has no criminal history beyond the 2017 conviction, and\n\n  there is a low risk of recidivism.\n\n        When imposing sentences, district courts \u201cshould engage in a holistic inquiry\n\n  of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d Lente, 759 F.3d at 1174 (quotation marks omitted), and\n\n  \u201cconsider every convicted person as an individual,\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 52 (quoting\n\n                                             10\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024    Page: 11\n\n\n\n  Koon v United States, 518 U.S. 81, 113 (1996)). But while the court should not focus\n\n  solely on one factor, United States v. Walker, 844 F.3d 1253, 1259 (10th Cir. 2017),\n\n  it \u201cneed not afford equal weight to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d United States v. Cookson,\n\n  922 F.3d 1079, 1094 (10th Cir. 2019). \u201c[W]e must . . . defer not only to a district\n\n  court\u2019s factual findings but also to its determinations of the weight to be afforded to\n\n  such findings.\u201d United States v. Smart, 518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir. 2008). Where a\n\n  district court decides to vary, it \u201cproperly engages in [the \u00a7 3553(a)] inquiry when it\n\n  bases its decision on specific, articulable facts supporting the variance and does not\n\n  employ an impermissible methodology or rely on facts that would make the decision\n\n  out of bounds.\u201d Barnes, 890 F.3d at 916.\n\n        In this case, the district court expressly discussed and considered the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\n  factors, including the allegedly mitigating factors identified by Mr. Vasquez-Castro.\n\n  For example, the court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and\n\n  Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s history and characteristics, noting that \u201c[Mr. Vasquez-Castro]\n\n  was coming to [the] United States to work, that economic circumstances in his home\n\n  country are very difficult, and he has a family to support,\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. IV at 16,\n\n  and \u201cthat [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] has worked at the detention center and that he\u2019s a\n\n  model prisoner,\u201d id. at 17. Despite considering these facts, the district court\n\n  determined that \u201can increased sentence is just punishment,\u201d noting that it would help\n\n  protect the public and provide adequate deterrence. Id. at 18. The district court also\n\n  considered the kinds of sentences available, the Guidelines range, and the Guidelines\n\n  policy statements, concluding that the presumptive reasonableness of the Guidelines\n\n                                             11\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024     Page: 12\n\n\n\n  range of 18 to 24 months was overcome by the facts of the case, particularly\n\n  Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s prior conviction and his reentry into the country shortly after\n\n  his release. Finally, the court found that an increased sentence would avoid any\n\n  unwarranted sentencing disparity because Mr. Vasquez-Castro received a lower\n\n  sentence for his 2017 conviction than most defendants are given.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro disagrees with how the district court weighed each these\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But the record reflects that the district court considered each of the\n\n  factors, and we must defer to the weight the court afforded to them. United States v.\n\n  Gross, 44 F.4th 1298, 1305 (10th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e will not examine the weight a\n\n  district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the\n\n  balance between them anew.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because the\n\n  district court properly explained its decision to vary upward and based that decision\n\n  on appropriate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the resulting sentence was\n\n  substantively reasonable.\n\n        Focus on the 2017 Conviction\n\n        In addition, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues the district court \u201cmyopically focused\n\n  on [his] prior State sex offense and re-punished him for . . . what it perceived to be\n\n  too low of a sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He argues the Guidelines already took\n\n  his prior conviction fully into consideration when the court calculated his criminal\n\n  history category. Thus, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues that the district court\u2019s upward\n\n  variance essentially double-counted his 2017 conviction.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353          Date Filed: 01/19/2024      Page: 13\n\n\n\n         Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the court improperly focused on his prior\n\n  conviction is without merit. As has been addressed, the district court considered the\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors at length. There is \u201c[n]o limitation\u201d placed on the information that a\n\n  district court may consider \u201cconcerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d of a\n\n  defendant at sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. Further, we must defer to the district\n\n  court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s discussion of his 2017\n\n  conviction does not alone render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively\n\n  unreasonable.\n\n         In addition, contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s assertion, the district court did\n\n  not repunish him for his 2017 conviction. The court expressly stated that it was\n\n  \u201csentencing [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] only for this crime,\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. IV at 20,\n\n  and that it was \u201cnot re-punishing him for his State crime or trying to make up for a\n\n  lenient sentence in his State court [case],\u201d id. at 19. Instead, the district court\n\n  explained that it was \u201cconsidering [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] past behavior in imposing\n\n  a sentence that will deter [him], protect the public, and satisfy the other 3553(a)\n\n  factors.\u201d Id. at 20. And the court noted \u201cthat the lenient sentence in his prior case did\n\n  not prevent him from coming to the United States so quickly upon release; thereby\n\n  committing another felony.\u201d Id. at 19.\n\n         Finally, Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n  already counted his 2017 conviction, and that the district court\u2019s further\n\n  consideration of that conviction resulting in a \u201cdouble counting,\u201d is unavailing. The\n\n  Sentencing Guidelines themselves reflect that a defendant\u2019s criminal history may\n\n                                              13\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024     Page: 14\n\n\n\n  justify a sentence above the Guidelines range. For example, the Guidelines explicitly\n\n  consider the possibility of upward variances when \u201creliable information indicates that\n\n  the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the\n\n  seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant\n\n  will commit other crimes.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\n\n  Manual, \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) (Nov. 2021). Similarly, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2), when a\n\n  defendant engaged in criminal conduct resulting in a felony conviction prior to his\n\n  first order of deportation or removal, his offense level for illegal reentry will increase\n\n  by an amount calculated based on the length of the sentence imposed for the prior\n\n  felony conviction. The comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 explain \u201c[t]here may be cases\n\n  in which the offense level provided by an enhancement in subsection (b)(2)\n\n  . . . substantially understates or overstates the seriousness of the conduct underlying\n\n  the prior offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). When \u201cthe length of the sentence\n\n  imposed does not reflect the seriousness of the prior offense[,] . . . a departure may\n\n  be warranted.\u201d Id. Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of the 2017 conviction does\n\n  not render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable.\n\n                               III.       CONCLUSION\n\n        Contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s arguments, the district court\u2019s weighing of\n\n  the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, consideration of his prior offense conduct, and resulting\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01/19/2024   Page: 15\n\n\n\n  sentencing decision was substantively reasonable.

BACKGROUND\n\n       Mr. Vasquez-Castro is a citizen of Guatemala. He was born in Guatemala in\n\n July 1993. When Mr. Vasquez-Castro was approximately fifteen years old, his family\n\n asked whether he was willing to live and work with one of his brothers in the United\n\n States. Mr. Vasquez-Castro agreed to move, although he does not remember who\n\n brought him to the United States without inspection. Mr. Vasquez-Castro reportedly\n\n lived in Memphis, Tennessee, for three years before moving to Dodge City, Kansas,\n\n with his brother and his brother\u2019s family.\n\n       In 2017, Mr. Vasquez-Castro was convicted of attempted rape of his twelve-\n\n year-old niece. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in the instant case\n\n provides that, in April 2017, a faculty member at Dodge City Middle School\n\n contacted the police to report allegations of sexual assault made by a female student.\n\n According to an official affidavit, the defendant kissed his twelve-year-old niece on\n\n the mouth, tried to take off her shirt, touched her breasts, and touched her vagina\n\n beneath her clothing. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then bought the victim a cell phone and\n\n told her not to tell anyone about the incident. Mr. Vasquez-Castro was arrested and\n\n interviewed by the police, at which point he admitted to forcing a kiss on the victim,\n\n grabbing her by the arms, and holding her still, while he tried to lift her shirt. He\n\n stated he used his hands to feel the victim\u2019s belly, breast, and front torso, and\n\n subsequently touched the victim under her clothing, touching her breasts and vagina.\n\n He then digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina. He reported he gained an erection\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01/19/2024       Page: 3\n\n\n\n from this, but let the victim go because he wanted to have sex with her and knew it\n\n was wrong.\n\n        Later, in November 2017, during an evaluation with the Kansas Department of\n\n Corrections, Mr. Vasquez-Castro denied the incident and stated he only gave the\n\n victim a cell phone. He admitted to telling the police he touched the victim in a\n\n sexually inappropriate manner, but stated he admitted to having done so because the\n\n police repeatedly asked him the same question and Mr. Vasquez-Castro thought that\n\n by admitting to the incident, the police would let him go. He alleged the victim\n\n engaged in sexual behavior with a friend with the same name as Mr. Vasquez-Castro.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro was charged with attempted rape in Kansas state court and\n\n pleaded no contest to the charge. The standard presumptive sentence for the offense\n\n was 59 months of incarceration. However, the court sentenced him to 48 months\u2019\n\n incarceration, departing downward based on the victim\u2019s request, Mr. Vasquez-\n\n Castro\u2019s age, and Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s criminal history. He was subsequently\n\n deported from the United States on October 21, 2020.\n\n        On October 8, 2022, United States Border Patrol agents found\n\n Mr. Vasquez-Castro, in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico, attempting to conceal\n\n himself. He admitted to being a citizen of Guatemala without legal authorization to\n\n enter or remain in the United States. Mr. Vazquez was charged with reentry of a\n\n removed alien, in violation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). He entered a\n\n guilty plea.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024       Page: 4\n\n\n\n       The PSR calculated Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s total offense level as 13 and his\n\n criminal history category as III, resulting in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 18 to\n\n 24 months. Neither party objected to the PSR. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a low-\n\n end Guidelines sentence, or downward variance, asserting that such a sentence would\n\n be sufficient. The Government opposed Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s request and asked that\n\n the court sentence Mr. Vasquez-Castro at the high end of the Guidelines range. The\n\n district court notified the parties before sentencing that it was contemplating an\n\n upward variance.\n\n       The district court sentenced Mr. Vasquez-Castro on April 11, 2023. The court\n\n reiterated at the sentencing hearing that it was considering an upward variance. The\n\n Government stated its position that a high-end sentence of 24 months would be\n\n sufficient to protect the public and deter Mr. Vasquez-Castro from returning to the\n\n United States again. Mr. Vasquez-Castro requested a sentence on the lower end or\n\n below the Guidelines range, arguing through counsel that he had been a model\n\n prisoner, he has family in his home country, he was very isolated at the time of his\n\n 2017 conviction, his relationship with his twelve-year-old niece was not sexual in\n\n nature, and he pleaded guilty to molesting her because he was frightened of getting a\n\n more severe sentence. Mr. Vasquez-Castro then addressed the court directly. He\n\n apologized for entering the country illegally, explained that he had gotten married\n\n and had a child since he was deported in 2020, and stated that he returned to the\n\n United States in search of employment to provide for his family. He requested the\n\n opportunity to be reunited with his wife and child.

Despite considering these facts, the district court\n\n  determined that \u201can increased sentence is just punishment,\u201d noting that it would help\n\n  protect the public and provide adequate deterrence. Id. at 18. The district court also\n\n  considered the kinds of sentences available, the Guidelines range, and the Guidelines\n\n  policy statements, concluding that the presumptive reasonableness of the Guidelines\n\n                                             11\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024     Page: 12\n\n\n\n  range of 18 to 24 months was overcome by the facts of the case, particularly\n\n  Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s prior conviction and his reentry into the country shortly after\n\n  his release. Finally, the court found that an increased sentence would avoid any\n\n  unwarranted sentencing disparity because Mr. Vasquez-Castro received a lower\n\n  sentence for his 2017 conviction than most defendants are given.\n\n        Mr. Vasquez-Castro disagrees with how the district court weighed each these\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But the record reflects that the district court considered each of the\n\n  factors, and we must defer to the weight the court afforded to them. United States v.\n\n  Gross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">44 F.4th 1298</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (10th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e will not examine the weight a\n\n  district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the\n\n  balance between them anew.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because the\n\n  district court properly explained its decision to vary upward and based that decision\n\n  on appropriate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the resulting sentence was\n\n  substantively reasonable.\n\n        Focus on the 2017 Conviction\n\n        In addition, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues the district court \u201cmyopically focused\n\n  on [his] prior State sex offense and re-punished him for . . . what it perceived to be\n\n  too low of a sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He argues the Guidelines already took\n\n  his prior conviction fully into consideration when the court calculated his criminal\n\n  history category. Thus, Mr. Vasquez-Castro argues that the district court\u2019s upward\n\n  variance essentially double-counted his 2017 conviction.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353          Date Filed: 01/19/2024      Page: 13\n\n\n\n         Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the court improperly focused on his prior\n\n  conviction is without merit. As has been addressed, the district court considered the\n\n  \u00a7 3553(a) factors at length. There is \u201c[n]o limitation\u201d placed on the information that a\n\n  district court may consider \u201cconcerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d of a\n\n  defendant at sentencing. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Further, we must defer to the district\n\n  court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s discussion of his 2017\n\n  conviction does not alone render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively\n\n  unreasonable.\n\n         In addition, contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s assertion, the district court did\n\n  not repunish him for his 2017 conviction. The court expressly stated that it was\n\n  \u201csentencing [Mr. Vasquez-Castro] only for this crime,\u201d Supp. ROA Vol. IV at 20,\n\n  and that it was \u201cnot re-punishing him for his State crime or trying to make up for a\n\n  lenient sentence in his State court [case],\u201d id. at 19. Instead, the district court\n\n  explained that it was \u201cconsidering [Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s] past behavior in imposing\n\n  a sentence that will deter [him], protect the public, and satisfy the other 3553(a)\n\n  factors.\u201d Id. at 20. And the court noted \u201cthat the lenient sentence in his prior case did\n\n  not prevent him from coming to the United States so quickly upon release; thereby\n\n  committing another felony.\u201d Id. at 19.\n\n         Finally, Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n  already counted his 2017 conviction, and that the district court\u2019s further\n\n  consideration of that conviction resulting in a \u201cdouble counting,\u201d is unavailing. The\n\n  Sentencing Guidelines themselves reflect that a defendant\u2019s criminal history may\n\n                                              13\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067     Document: 010110986353        Date Filed: 01/19/2024     Page: 14\n\n\n\n  justify a sentence above the Guidelines range. For example, the Guidelines explicitly\n\n  consider the possibility of upward variances when \u201creliable information indicates that\n\n  the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the\n\n  seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant\n\n  will commit other crimes.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\n\n  Manual, \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) (Nov. 2021). Similarly, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2), when a\n\n  defendant engaged in criminal conduct resulting in a felony conviction prior to his\n\n  first order of deportation or removal, his offense level for illegal reentry will increase\n\n  by an amount calculated based on the length of the sentence imposed for the prior\n\n  felony conviction. The comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 explain \u201c[t]here may be cases\n\n  in which the offense level provided by an enhancement in subsection (b)(2)\n\n  . . . substantially understates or overstates the seriousness of the conduct underlying\n\n  the prior offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). When \u201cthe length of the sentence\n\n  imposed does not reflect the seriousness of the prior offense[,] . . . a departure may\n\n  be warranted.\u201d Id. Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of the 2017 conviction does\n\n  not render Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable.\n\n                               III.       CONCLUSION\n\n        Contrary to Mr. Vasquez-Castro\u2019s arguments, the district court\u2019s weighing of\n\n  the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, consideration of his prior offense conduct, and resulting\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fAppellate Case: 23-2067    Document: 010110986353       Date Filed: 01/19/2024   Page: 15\n\n\n\n  sentencing decision was substantively reasonable.
