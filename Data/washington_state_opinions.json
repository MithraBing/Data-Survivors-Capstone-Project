The answer to that question is complicated. It is \u201cyes,\u201d except when a statute exempts\n\nthe State from liability for a particular filing fee, unless another provision requires a civil defendant\n\nto pay the fee if the State prevails. After our opinion on original submission, Appellant (the surety\n\n\n\n        1\n            Or in some cases, a criminal defendant.\n\f                               CONTINENTAL HERITAGE INSURANCE COMPANY \u2014 2\n\nin this case) filed a motion for rehearing.

BACKGROUND\n\n                                 A. Bond Forfeiture and Costs\n\n       Darrell David was indicted for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. David failed to\n\nappear at a trial setting, and a judgment nisi was entered for the forfeiture of a $10,000 bond. On\n\nOctober 9, 2020, a final judgment of forfeiture was signed, forfeiting the bond and requiring the\n\npayment of $100 interest, $396 in court costs, and any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by\n\nthe county for the return of the criminal defendant. The clerk\u2019s bill of costs, issued the same day,\n\nitemized the following:\n\n       JUDICIAL SALARY FEE                                           42.00\n       CLERK\u2019S FEE                                                   50.00\n       COURT REP SERV FEE                                            15.00\n       LAW LIBRARY                                                   20.00\n       BAILIFF\u2019S FEE                                                 20.00\n       APPELLATE FUND                                                5.00\n       STATE JUDICIAL FEE                                            50.00\n       DISPUTE MEDIATION                                             15.00\n       RECORDS PRESERVATION                                          10.00\n       DC ARCHIVE FEE                                                10.00\n       COURT HOUSE SEC FEE                                           5.00\n       RECORDS MGT & PRES                                            5.00\n       STATE INDIGENCY FEE                                           10.00\n       RECORDS MANAGEMENT                                            5.00\n       CIVIL COURTS BLDG IM                                          15.00\n       ST ELECTRONIC FILING                                          30.00\n       INTEREST ON BONF                                              100.00\n       CLERK\u2019S FEE - MISC                                            8.00\n\n\n       2\n          See Diamond v.

The\n\nmotion contended that the collection of civil filing fees was not authorized in bond forfeiture\n\nproceedings. It identified specific fees it claimed it should not have to pay, which were most of the\n\nfees in the bill of costs. The motion contended that authority to dispute costs was conferred by Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure article 103.008.3\n\n        The parties litigated the issue before the trial court. The State took the position that the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to revise costs under Article 103.008 and also argued that the costs were\n\nlegitimate. The surety took the position that the trial court had jurisdiction to address the costs and\n\nthat it should have to pay only some of the court costs, which the surety believed totaled $94. The\n\ntrial court ruled that it had jurisdiction to address the issue of court costs, but it denied the surety\u2019s\n\nmotion to revise the costs.\n\n        On November 10, 2020, the surety filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                               B. Appeal\n\n        The court of appeals concluded that civil filing fees were court costs that could be assessed\n\nin a bond forfeiture proceeding.4 In arriving at this conclusion, the court relied on our decisions in\n\n\n\n        3\n          See TEX.

ANALYSIS\n\n                                A. Construction of Statutes and Rules\n\n          A court must construe a statute in accordance with the plain meaning of its text unless the\n\ntext is ambiguous or the plain meaning leads to absurd results that the legislature could not possibly\n\nhave intended.8 In determining plain meaning, we may resort to standard dictionaries, and we apply\n\nthe canons of construction.9 If called upon to look beyond the plain meaning of the text, we look\n\ninitially to statutory history, which narrowly involves looking at prior versions of the statute.10 If we\n\nneed to look further in an extra textual analysis, a variety of other factors can be considered,\n\nincluding the object sought to be attained by the statute, the legislative history, and the consequences\n\nof a particular construction.11 When construing a court rule, we can consider extra textual factors\n\neven if the text of the rule is not ambiguous or does not lead to absurd results, but we nevertheless\n\n          5\n               865 S.W.2d 461 (Tex.

We need not address\nwhether TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 1.026 would affect our analysis since that provision became\neffective only on January 1, 2021, after the judgment, imposition of court costs, and notice of appeal\nin this case.

Jurisdiction\n\n        The State continues to maintain that a surety cannot use Article 103.008 to challenge court\n\ncosts. We need not address the applicability of Article 103.008 because the record otherwise shows\n\njurisdiction and authority to address the surety\u2019s court-costs challenge. Except as otherwise provided\n\nby Chapter 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, bond-forfeiture proceedings \u201cshall be governed\n\nby the same rules governing other civil suits.\u201d13 And appeals in bond forfeiture proceedings are\n\nlikewise \u201cregulated by the same rules that govern civil actions where an appeal is taken.\u201d14 In civil\n\ncases, a trial court retains plenary power to modify a judgment within 30 days after it is signed.15\n\nThe surety filed its motion to correct costs within the trial court\u2019s period of plenary power, so the\n\ntrial court was empowered to address it. Moreover, if a motion to modify the judgment is timely\n\nfiled, the losing party in a civil case has 90 days from the date the judgment is signed to file a notice\n\nof appeal.16 The notice of appeal was filed well within the 90 day period. Both the trial court and\n\nthe court of appeals had jurisdiction to address the surety\u2019s court-costs complaint.\n\n                                               C.

And the attorney general\n\nopinions construing \u00a7 6.001were in response to inquiries by a district attorney and a county attorney,\n\nwhere clerks, sheriffs, or constables were insisting on the payment of fees in advance.25\n\n       Importantly, \u00a7 6.001 \u201conly exempts the state from advance payment of filing fees and other\n\ncourt costs\u201d and \u201cdoes not exempt it from ultimately paying such costs.\u201d26 So if the State loses, it\n\nordinarily has to pay the filing fees, unless some other statutory exemption applies. Some court-cost\n\nstatutes exempt the \u201ccounty\u201d or a \u201cstate agency\u201d from paying certain filing fees.27 But others do\n\nnot.28 In one statute codifying multiple filing fees, the State was exempted from only one filing\n\nfee\u2014which shows that the Legislature knows how to speak its mind on whether the State is to be\n\nexempt from paying a filing fee.29\n\n\n\n\n       24\n          See id. \u00a7 6.001(c) (\u201cNotwithstanding Subsection (a), a county or district attorney is not\nexempted from filing a bond to take out an extraordinary writ unless the commissioners court of the\ncounty approves the exemption in an action brought in behalf of the county or unless the attorney\ngeneral approves the exemption in an action brought in behalf of the state.\u201d).\n       25\n       See DM-459, 1997 Tex.

We conclude that the answer is \u201cno,\u201d except where a statute\n\nprovides otherwise. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure \u201ccosts\u201d mean \u201cany fee charged by the court\n\nor an officer of the court, including, but not limited to, filing fees . . .\u201d31 When the State\u2019s liability\n\nfor the fee is deferred, it still makes sense to say it is \u201ccharged\u201d for the fee\u2014it is just not required\n\nto pay it yet. But if the State is exempt entirely from the fee, then it was not charged the fee, and so\n\nit is not a \u201ccost\u201din the case\u2014unless, of course, the legislature otherwise makes it a cost. One filing-\n\nfee statute provides that, if the State prevails in a lawsuit it files, the non-prevailing parties are liable\n\nfor a certain filing fee the State is exempt from ever having to pay.32 This shows that the legislature\n\nknows how to impose a filing fee the State is exempt from on a defendant if the State wins. Other\n\nfiling-fee statutes that exempt the State from paying the fee do not include such a provision.

Application to Bond-Forfeiture Proceedings\n\n        A bond forfeiture proceeding originating from a criminal prosecution is a criminal matter,\n\nover which this Court ultimately has appellate jurisdiction.33 But by statute, rules governing civil\n\nactions apply:\n\n        When a forfeiture has been declared upon a bond, the court or clerk shall docket the\n        case upon the scire facias or upon the civil docket, in the name of the State of Texas,\n        as plaintiff, and the principal and his sureties, if any, as defendants; and, except as\n        otherwise provided by this chapter, the proceedings had therein shall be governed by\n        the same rules governing other civil suits.34\n\nConstruing this statute in Dees v. State, this Court held that civil court costs may be assessed in a\n\nbail bond forfeiture proceeding after entry of the judgment nisi.35 But in Safety Nat\u2019l Cas. Corp. v.\n\nState, we held that appellate filing fees could not be collected in bond-forfeiture appeals because our\n\npredecessor court would have been precluded from assessing such fees due to an 1879 statute\n\nrestricting that court\u2019s collection of civil fees to civil cases.36 We found Dees to be distinguishable\n\nbecause the trial-level civil fee statutes in effect in 1879 included no provision \u201crestricting their\n\napplication to civil cases.\u201d37\n\n        The surety suggests that it should not pay civil filing fees because the bond forfeiture\n\n\n        33\n             Int\u2019l Fidelity Ins.

Relying specifically on\n\nthe \u201cscire facias\u201d language in Article 22.10, the surety argues that the bond-forfeiture proceeding is\n\nmerely a continuation of the criminal prosecution and not a separate case at all. An amicus brief\n\nlikewise says that a bond forfeiture proceeding is a \u201cscire facias\u201d proceeding and a mere continuation\n\nof the criminal prosecution. The surety also seeks to draw a distinction between court costs and\n\n\u201cfiling fees.\u201d The surety further relies on language in the various filing fee statutes saying that the\n\nfee applies only in a \u201ccivil case.\u201d And the surety says that the word \u201crules\u201d in Article 22.10 indicates\n\nthat only the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and not civil statutes that might also govern civil suits,\n\napply to bond-forfeiture proceedings. After deducting the filing fees, the surety concludes that it\n\nshould have to pay only $84 of the $396 in billed court costs.38\n\n        We reject the surety\u2019s and amicus\u2019s contention that the bond-forfeiture proceeding is a mere\n\ncontinuation of the criminal prosecution. It is true that a \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is considered a\n\ncontinuation of a proceeding and not a new proceeding.39 In bond-forfeiture proceedings, the \u201cscire\n\nfacias writ serves two purposes, one as a citation to the sureties, the other, as the State\u2019s pleading.\u201d40\n\nBut as we will demonstrate shortly, the \u201cscire facias\u201d writ in a bond-forfeiture proceeding is not a\n\ncontinuation of the criminal prosecution; it is a continuation of the bond-forfeiture proceedings\n\ninitiated by the judgment nisi that provisionally forfeits the bond.\n\n        A \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is defined as \u201c[a] writ requiring the person against whom it is issued to\n\nappear and show cause why some matter of record should not be enforced, annulled, or vacated, or\n\n\n        38\n             The surety concedes it must also pay the $100 in interest.\n        39\n             Berly v.

In a bond forfeiture\n\ncase, a \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is not used to revive, enforce, annul, or vacate a criminal prosecution or\n\na judgment of conviction in a criminal prosecution. In fact, a bond can be forfeited before a criminal\n\ndefendant is ever convicted of the offense for which he has been indicted.45 And even if bond is\n\nforfeited after conviction, the \u201cscire facias\u201d writ in the bond-forfeiture proceedings would have no\n\neffect on the conviction.46 What \u201cscire facias\u201d is used for is to enforce the judgment nisi in a bond-\n\nforfeiture proceeding. It satisfies the same function as it does in certain contempt proceedings, where\n\na judgment nisi is issued for contempt. A \u201cscire facias\u201d writ continues the contempt proceeding, not\n\n\n       41\n           Scire Facias, BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). See also Kubosh v.

This conclusion is further supported\n\nby the statutory language making the State the \u201cplaintiff\u201d and the criminal defendant and his sureties\n\nthe defendants.49 Furthermore, the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the sureties (or the criminal\n\ndefendant) to file an answer\u2014something a civil defendant would do after the filing of a civil action.50\n\nIf an answer is not filed, a default judgment can be taken, just as would happen in a civil suit if no\n\nanswer is made.51 Also, regardless of what happens in the criminal prosecution, the bond-forfeiture\n\njudgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d after the trial of the bond-forfeiture issues (or a default judgment), and\n\nexecution can be had on that judgment as in civil actions.52 A bond-forfeiture judgment is separately\n\n\n       47\n            Hester v.

Habeas corpus provides a ready analogy. A habeas corpus action is related\n\nto a criminal proceeding being attacked but is nevertheless considered to be a separate action.56\n\n       The remainder of the surety\u2019s contentions turn upon what Article 22.10 means by \u201crules.\u201d\n\nDo \u201crules governing other civil suits\u201d mean only formal, court-promulgated rules such as the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure? Or does \u201crules\u201d have a more generic meaning that could encompass civil\n\nstatutes? In Safety Nat\u2019l, Judge Meyers wrote in a concurring opinion that \u201cit is only the Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure that apply\u201d and that \u201cthe Rules of Civil Procedure do not impose filing fees.\u201d57\n\nUnder that view, the filing fees are not part of the rules that govern civil suits under Article 22.10\n\nbecause those fees derive only from statute.

The legislature would still have had this broad understanding of \u201crules\u201d when it\n\nenacted Article 449 in 1879, the predecessor to our current Article 22.10.\n\n\n\n        73\n             See supra at n.71.\n        74\n             See id.\n        75\n             TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 769 (1856).\n        76\n             See Paulsen, 65 TEX. L. REV. at 464-68.\n        77\n          See Revised Civil Statutes of 1879, Arts. 2218, 2219, 2220, 2232 (enacted 1846), 2231\n(enacted 1848).\n\f                           CONTINENTAL HERITAGE MOTION FOR REHEARING \u2014 18\n\n       In any event, it is still true, as we explained supra and in our opinion on original submission,\n\nthat the legislature has in other provisions of our current Code of Criminal Procedure specifically\n\nreferred to the Rules of Civil Procedure when it intended one or more of those rules to apply. If the\n\nlegislature had intended for bond-forfeiture proceedings to be governed solely by the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, it could have easily said so, but it did not.\n\n       And as we have previously explained, we have already held in Dees that civil court costs can\n\nbe collected in bond-forfeiture proceedings. The Rules of Civil Procedure regulate when court costs\n\nare paid, whether security is given for costs, who must pay the costs, and how payment of costs may\n\nbe enforced.78 A couple of these rules allow for additional costs to be charged,79 but in general, the\n\nRules of Civil Procedure do not prescribe costs.80 So statutory fees are necessarily the source of a\n\nlarge part of court costs. We conclude that trial-level filing fees are part of the court costs that the\n\nsurety who loses a bond-forfeiture case will have to pay.\n\n                                  3. Liability for Only Some Costs\n\n       But as we alluded to earlier, the surety is not liable for every possible filing fee. The surety\n\nhas to pay only the filing fees the State would have paid if it had lost, except where a statute\n\nnevertheless requires the defendant to pay the filing fee when the State wins. By statute, there are\n\nexactly five ways that the State can lose a bond forfeiture case.81 Under the fifth\u2014subsequent\n\n\n       78\n          See TEX. R. CIV. P. 125, 127, 129, 130, 131, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144,\n145, 146, 147, 148, 149.\n       79\n           Id. 126 (service in a county other than the one in which the constable or sheriff is an\nofficer), 133 (permitting a court to charge costs on motions).\n       80\n            See supra at n.65.\n       81\n            TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 22.13(a).\n\f                             CONTINENTAL HERITAGE MOTION FOR REHEARING \u2014 19\n\nincarceration\u2014there is a statutory requirement that the surety pay the court costs, even though it has\n\n\u201cwon\u201d and does not have to forfeit the bond.82 But under the first four ways that the State can lose,\n\nthe State would be liable for the filing fees that it is not exempt from paying. Because liability for\n\nthose filing fees is simply deferred, the fees are still owed if the State prevails, but because the State\n\nprevails, those costs can be taxed to the criminal defendant or his sureties.83\n\n        As we explained earlier, when the State-plaintiff is exempt altogether from paying the fee,\n\nthen there is no fee in the case to tax to the defendant, absent a provision saying otherwise. The\n\nsurety has outlined the various fees and the statutory sections upon which it thinks those fees are\n\nbased. If the surety\u2019s assessment of which fees are derived from which statutes is correct, then the\n\nitems \u201claw library fee,\u201d \u201cappellate fund,\u201d \u201cdispute mediation,\u201d and \u201cDC archive fee\u201d all appear to\n\nbe fees that the State is exempt from paying and that the losing defendant is not otherwise required\n\nto pay.84 The State also appears to be exempt from paying the \u201ccourthouse security fee,\u201d but it\n\nappears that the authorizing statute requires the defendant to pay the fee anyway if the State\n\nprevails.85 We make no final determination regarding these fees, but leave the issue to the court of\n\nappeals to decide in the first instance.\n\n        We also see two fees that might improperly duplicate another fee assessed. The surety has\n\npointed out that the \u201crecords preservation\u201d fee of $10.00 derives from Government Code \u00a7\n\n\n\n\n        82\n             Id. art. 22.13(b).\n        83\n             See TEX. R. CIV. P. 131.\n        84\n             See supra at n.26.\n        85\n             See supra at n.31.\n\f                             CONTINENTAL HERITAGE MOTION FOR REHEARING \u2014 20\n\n51.317(b)(4), which would be a proper fee.86 But it notes two subsequent fees in the bill of\n\ncosts\u2014\u201crecords mgt & pres\u201d for $5.00 and \u201crecords management\u201d for $5.00\u2014deriving from \u00a7\n\n51.317(c)(1) and (2).87 Subsection (c) does not impose filing fees.88 Instead, it says where the fee\n\nimposed in (b)(4) should be sent, with half going to a county records management and preservation\n\nfund and half going to a district-clerk records management and preservation fund.89 If the three fees\n\nare as described, then the two $5 fees duplicate the earlier $10 fee. We leave it to the court of\n\nappeals to decide in the first instance if that is in fact the case.\n\n                                            III. DISPOSITION\n\n        We hold that a surety can be liable\u2014and is generally liable\u2014for civil filing fees as court\n\ncosts in a bond-forfeiture action when the State prevails. But the surety is not liable for a filing fee\n\nthat the State is entirely exempt from paying unless a statute nevertheless requires a civil defendant\n\nto pay the fee if the State prevails. The surety also cannot be required to pay a fee that improperly\n\nduplicates a fee already charged. We vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the\n\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nDelivered: January 17, 2024\n\nPublish\n\n\n\n\n        86\n             See TEX.

The answer to that question is complicated.

We grant the motion for rehearing, withdraw our previous\n\nopinion, and substitute this opinion in its place.2 Although one of Appellant\u2019s arguments affects a\n\nportion of our reasoning, our holding remains unchanged.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                 A. Bond Forfeiture and Costs\n\n       Darrell David was indicted for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. David failed to\n\nappear at a trial setting, and a judgment nisi was entered for the forfeiture of a $10,000 bond. On\n\nOctober 9, 2020, a final judgment of forfeiture was signed, forfeiting the bond and requiring the\n\npayment of $100 interest, $396 in court costs, and any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by\n\nthe county for the return of the criminal defendant.

The\n\nmotion contended that the collection of civil filing fees was not authorized in bond forfeiture\n\nproceedings. It identified specific fees it claimed it should not have to pay, which were most of the\n\nfees in the bill of costs. The motion contended that authority to dispute costs was conferred by Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure article 103.008.3\n\n        The parties litigated the issue before the trial court. The State took the position that the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to revise costs under Article 103.008 and also argued that the costs were\n\nlegitimate. The surety took the position that the trial court had jurisdiction to address the costs and\n\nthat it should have to pay only some of the court costs, which the surety believed totaled $94. The\n\ntrial court ruled that it had jurisdiction to address the issue of court costs, but it denied the surety\u2019s\n\nmotion to revise the costs.\n\n        On November 10, 2020, the surety filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                               B.

ANALYSIS\n\n                                A. Construction of Statutes and Rules\n\n          A court must construe a statute in accordance with the plain meaning of its text unless the\n\ntext is ambiguous or the plain meaning leads to absurd results that the legislature could not possibly\n\nhave intended.8 In determining plain meaning, we may resort to standard dictionaries, and we apply\n\nthe canons of construction.9 If called upon to look beyond the plain meaning of the text, we look\n\ninitially to statutory history, which narrowly involves looking at prior versions of the statute.10 If we\n\nneed to look further in an extra textual analysis, a variety of other factors can be considered,\n\nincluding the object sought to be attained by the statute, the legislative history, and the consequences\n\nof a particular construction.11 When construing a court rule, we can consider extra textual factors\n\neven if the text of the rule is not ambiguous or does not lead to absurd results, but we nevertheless\n\n          5\n               </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2446823\"><a href=\"/opinion/2446823/dees-v-state/\">865 S.W.2d 461</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

Jurisdiction\n\n        The State continues to maintain that a surety cannot use Article 103.008 to challenge court\n\ncosts. We need not address the applicability of Article 103.008 because the record otherwise shows\n\njurisdiction and authority to address the surety\u2019s court-costs challenge. Except as otherwise provided\n\nby Chapter 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, bond-forfeiture proceedings \u201cshall be governed\n\nby the same rules governing other civil suits.\u201d13 And appeals in bond forfeiture proceedings are\n\nlikewise \u201cregulated by the same rules that govern civil actions where an appeal is taken.\u201d14 In civil\n\ncases, a trial court retains plenary power to modify a judgment within 30 days after it is signed.15\n\nThe surety filed its motion to correct costs within the trial court\u2019s period of plenary power, so the\n\ntrial court was empowered to address it. Moreover, if a motion to modify the judgment is timely\n\nfiled, the losing party in a civil case has 90 days from the date the judgment is signed to file a notice\n\nof appeal.16 The notice of appeal was filed well within the 90 day period. Both the trial court and\n\nthe court of appeals had jurisdiction to address the surety\u2019s court-costs complaint.\n\n                                               C.

And the attorney general\n\nopinions construing \u00a7 6.001were in response to inquiries by a district attorney and a county attorney,\n\nwhere clerks, sheriffs, or constables were insisting on the payment of fees in advance.25\n\n       Importantly, \u00a7 6.001 \u201conly exempts the state from advance payment of filing fees and other\n\ncourt costs\u201d and \u201cdoes not exempt it from ultimately paying such costs.\u201d26 So if the State loses, it\n\nordinarily has to pay the filing fees, unless some other statutory exemption applies.

We conclude that the answer is \u201cno,\u201d except where a statute\n\nprovides otherwise. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure \u201ccosts\u201d mean \u201cany fee charged by the court\n\nor an officer of the court, including, but not limited to, filing fees . . .\u201d31 When the State\u2019s liability\n\nfor the fee is deferred, it still makes sense to say it is \u201ccharged\u201d for the fee\u2014it is just not required\n\nto pay it yet. But if the State is exempt entirely from the fee, then it was not charged the fee, and so\n\nit is not a \u201ccost\u201din the case\u2014unless, of course, the legislature otherwise makes it a cost. One filing-\n\nfee statute provides that, if the State prevails in a lawsuit it files, the non-prevailing parties are liable\n\nfor a certain filing fee the State is exempt from ever having to pay.32 This shows that the legislature\n\nknows how to impose a filing fee the State is exempt from on a defendant if the State wins. Other\n\nfiling-fee statutes that exempt the State from paying the fee do not include such a provision. The\n\nimplication is that the legislature did not intend to impose the exempt fee on a losing defendant.\n\n        To summarize: The State does not have to pay a filing fee up-front when it files a civil\n\nlawsuit (filing fees are deferred), but it is still liable for most filing fees if it loses. The State is\n\nexempt from paying some filing fees in a civil case even if it loses. Because those exempt filing fees\n\n\n\n        30\n             See TEX. R. CIV.

Application to Bond-Forfeiture Proceedings\n\n        A bond forfeiture proceeding originating from a criminal prosecution is a criminal matter,\n\nover which this Court ultimately has appellate jurisdiction.33 But by statute, rules governing civil\n\nactions apply:\n\n        When a forfeiture has been declared upon a bond, the court or clerk shall docket the\n        case upon the scire facias or upon the civil docket, in the name of the State of Texas,\n        as plaintiff, and the principal and his sureties, if any, as defendants; and, except as\n        otherwise provided by this chapter, the proceedings had therein shall be governed by\n        the same rules governing other civil suits.34\n\nConstruing this statute in Dees v. State, this Court held that civil court costs may be assessed in a\n\nbail bond forfeiture proceeding after entry of the judgment nisi.35 But in Safety Nat\u2019l Cas. Corp. v.\n\nState, we held that appellate filing fees could not be collected in bond-forfeiture appeals because our\n\npredecessor court would have been precluded from assessing such fees due to an 1879 statute\n\nrestricting that court\u2019s collection of civil fees to civil cases.36 We found Dees to be distinguishable\n\nbecause the trial-level civil fee statutes in effect in 1879 included no provision \u201crestricting their\n\napplication to civil cases.\u201d37\n\n        The surety suggests that it should not pay civil filing fees because the bond forfeiture\n\n\n        33\n             Int\u2019l Fidelity Ins.

Relying specifically on\n\nthe \u201cscire facias\u201d language in Article 22.10, the surety argues that the bond-forfeiture proceeding is\n\nmerely a continuation of the criminal prosecution and not a separate case at all. An amicus brief\n\nlikewise says that a bond forfeiture proceeding is a \u201cscire facias\u201d proceeding and a mere continuation\n\nof the criminal prosecution. The surety also seeks to draw a distinction between court costs and\n\n\u201cfiling fees.\u201d The surety further relies on language in the various filing fee statutes saying that the\n\nfee applies only in a \u201ccivil case.\u201d And the surety says that the word \u201crules\u201d in Article 22.10 indicates\n\nthat only the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and not civil statutes that might also govern civil suits,\n\napply to bond-forfeiture proceedings. After deducting the filing fees, the surety concludes that it\n\nshould have to pay only $84 of the $396 in billed court costs.38\n\n        We reject the surety\u2019s and amicus\u2019s contention that the bond-forfeiture proceeding is a mere\n\ncontinuation of the criminal prosecution. It is true that a \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is considered a\n\ncontinuation of a proceeding and not a new proceeding.39 In bond-forfeiture proceedings, the \u201cscire\n\nfacias writ serves two purposes, one as a citation to the sureties, the other, as the State\u2019s pleading.\u201d40\n\nBut as we will demonstrate shortly, the \u201cscire facias\u201d writ in a bond-forfeiture proceeding is not a\n\ncontinuation of the criminal prosecution; it is a continuation of the bond-forfeiture proceedings\n\ninitiated by the judgment nisi that provisionally forfeits the bond.\n\n        A \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is defined as \u201c[a] writ requiring the person against whom it is issued to\n\nappear and show cause why some matter of record should not be enforced, annulled, or vacated, or\n\n\n        38\n             The surety concedes it must also pay the $100 in interest.\n        39\n             Berly v.

In a bond forfeiture\n\ncase, a \u201cscire facias\u201d writ is not used to revive, enforce, annul, or vacate a criminal prosecution or\n\na judgment of conviction in a criminal prosecution. In fact, a bond can be forfeited before a criminal\n\ndefendant is ever convicted of the offense for which he has been indicted.45 And even if bond is\n\nforfeited after conviction, the \u201cscire facias\u201d writ in the bond-forfeiture proceedings would have no\n\neffect on the conviction.46 What \u201cscire facias\u201d is used for is to enforce the judgment nisi in a bond-\n\nforfeiture proceeding. It satisfies the same function as it does in certain contempt proceedings, where\n\na judgment nisi is issued for contempt.

This conclusion is further supported\n\nby the statutory language making the State the \u201cplaintiff\u201d and the criminal defendant and his sureties\n\nthe defendants.49 Furthermore, the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the sureties (or the criminal\n\ndefendant) to file an answer\u2014something a civil defendant would do after the filing of a civil action.50\n\nIf an answer is not filed, a default judgment can be taken, just as would happen in a civil suit if no\n\nanswer is made.51 Also, regardless of what happens in the criminal prosecution, the bond-forfeiture\n\njudgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d after the trial of the bond-forfeiture issues (or a default judgment), and\n\nexecution can be had on that judgment as in civil actions.52 A bond-forfeiture judgment is separately\n\n\n       47\n            Hester v.

Article 769 stated, \u201cThe rules prescribed in civil cases for taking\n\ndeposition of witnesses, shall, as to the manner and form of taking and returning the same, govern\n\nin criminal actions, when not in conflict with the requirements of this Code.\u201d75 According to one of\n\nAppellant\u2019s own sources, though, the court rules that existed in 1856 did not prescribe the manner\n\nand form of taking and returning depositions.76 But civil statutes did.77\n\n        Even assuming that the 1877 rules were more extensive than their predecessors, there is no\n\nreason to believe that the legislature\u2019s understanding that the \u201crules governing civil actions\u201d included\n\nstatutes had changed. This is because, until 1941, there was still a great deal of statutory regulation\n\nof civil practice. The legislature would still have had this broad understanding of \u201crules\u201d when it\n\nenacted Article 449 in 1879, the predecessor to our current Article 22.10.\n\n\n\n        73\n             See supra at n.71.\n        74\n             See id.\n        75\n             TEX.

If the\n\nlegislature had intended for bond-forfeiture proceedings to be governed solely by the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, it could have easily said so, but it did not.\n\n       And as we have previously explained, we have already held in Dees that civil court costs can\n\nbe collected in bond-forfeiture proceedings. The Rules of Civil Procedure regulate when court costs\n\nare paid, whether security is given for costs, who must pay the costs, and how payment of costs may\n\nbe enforced.78 A couple of these rules allow for additional costs to be charged,79 but in general, the\n\nRules of Civil Procedure do not prescribe costs.80 So statutory fees are necessarily the source of a\n\nlarge part of court costs. We conclude that trial-level filing fees are part of the court costs that the\n\nsurety who loses a bond-forfeiture case will have to pay.\n\n                                  3. Liability for Only Some Costs\n\n       But as we alluded to earlier, the surety is not liable for every possible filing fee. The surety\n\nhas to pay only the filing fees the State would have paid if it had lost, except where a statute\n\nnevertheless requires the defendant to pay the filing fee when the State wins. By statute, there are\n\nexactly five ways that the State can lose a bond forfeiture case.81 Under the fifth\u2014subsequent\n\n\n       78\n          See TEX. R. CIV. P. 125, 127, 129, 130, 131, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144,\n145, 146, 147, 148, 149.\n       79\n           Id. 126 (service in a county other than the one in which the constable or sheriff is an\nofficer), 133 (permitting a court to charge costs on motions).\n       80\n            See supra at n.65.\n       81\n            TEX. CODE CRIM.

Because liability for\n\nthose filing fees is simply deferred, the fees are still owed if the State prevails, but because the State\n\nprevails, those costs can be taxed to the criminal defendant or his sureties.83\n\n        As we explained earlier, when the State-plaintiff is exempt altogether from paying the fee,\n\nthen there is no fee in the case to tax to the defendant, absent a provision saying otherwise. The\n\nsurety has outlined the various fees and the statutory sections upon which it thinks those fees are\n\nbased. If the surety\u2019s assessment of which fees are derived from which statutes is correct, then the\n\nitems \u201claw library fee,\u201d \u201cappellate fund,\u201d \u201cdispute mediation,\u201d and \u201cDC archive fee\u201d all appear to\n\nbe fees that the State is exempt from paying and that the losing defendant is not otherwise required\n\nto pay.84 The State also appears to be exempt from paying the \u201ccourthouse security fee,\u201d but it\n\nappears that the authorizing statute requires the defendant to pay the fee anyway if the State\n\nprevails.85 We make no final determination regarding these fees, but leave the issue to the court of\n\nappeals to decide in the first instance.\n\n        We also see two fees that might improperly duplicate another fee assessed. The surety has\n\npointed out that the \u201crecords preservation\u201d fee of $10.00 derives from Government Code \u00a7\n\n\n\n\n        82\n             Id. art. 22.13(b).\n        83\n             See TEX.

We leave it to the court of\n\nappeals to decide in the first instance if that is in fact the case.\n\n                                            III. DISPOSITION\n\n        We hold that a surety can be liable\u2014and is generally liable\u2014for civil filing fees as court\n\ncosts in a bond-forfeiture action when the State prevails. But the surety is not liable for a filing fee\n\nthat the State is entirely exempt from paying unless a statute nevertheless requires a civil defendant\n\nto pay the fee if the State prevails. The surety also cannot be required to pay a fee that improperly\n\nduplicates a fee already charged. We vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the\n\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nDelivered: January 17, 2024\n\nPublish\n\n\n\n\n        86\n             See TEX.

See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21. The statute\n\nprovides that a person commits an offense if he \u201cforges a writing with intent to defraud or\n\nharm another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 32.21(b). This base-level offense is a Class A misdemeanor. Id. \u00a7\n\n32.21(c). In 2017, the Legislature added a new subsection, (e-1), which sets forth an\n\nalternative \u201cvalue ladder\u201d offense-classification scheme. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1). Pursuant to\n\nthis value-ladder provision, \u201c[i]f it is shown on the trial of an offense that the actor engaged\n\nin the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service,\u201d then the offense\n\nclassification is based on the value of any property or services at issue. Id. The possible\n\noffense level starts at a Class C misdemeanor (for forgeries involving property or services\n\nvalued at less than $100) and extends to a first-degree felony (for forgeries involving\n\nproperty or services valued at over $300,000). Id. This value-ladder provision, however,\n\ndid not replace two original subsections in Section 32.21 setting forth exceptions to the\n\ndefault offense classification\u2014subsections (d) and (e). Those original subsections\n\nindependently provide that forgery of a specified type of writing (regardless of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s purpose for committing forgery or the value of any goods or services involved)\n\nis a state-jail felony or a third-degree felony, respectively. See id. \u00a7 32.21(d) (providing\n\nthat it is a state-jail felony to commit forgery of one of the enumerated types of financial\n\ninstruments), (e) (providing that it is a third-degree felony to commit forgery of currency\n\nor other governmental records or instruments). But the 2017 amendments also added\n\f                                                                                   Green & Lennox \u2013 3\n\n\nlanguage to subsections (d) and (e) stating that those provisions are \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection\n\n(e-1).\u201d Id. 1 The question we must resolve here is how to apply Section 32.21\u2019s competing\n\n\n\n1\n    The relevant portions of Section 32.21 provide:\n\n      (b) A person commits an offense if he forges a writing with intent to defraud or harm\n      another.\n\n      (c) Except as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (e-1), an offense under this section is a\n      Class A misdemeanor.\n\n      (d) Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state jail felony if the\n      writing is or purports to be a will, codicil, deed, deed of trust, mortgage, security\n      instrument, security agreement, credit card, check, authorization to debit an account at a\n      financial institution, or similar sight order for payment of money, contract, release, or other\n      commercial instrument.\n      (e) Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony of the third degree\n      if the writing is or purports to be:\n             (1) part of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps;\n             (2) a government record listed in Section 37.01(2)(C); or\n             (3) other instruments issued by a state or national government or by a subdivision\n             of either, or part of an issue of stock, bonds, or other instruments representing\n             interests in or claims against another person.\n      (e-1) If it is shown on the trial of an offense under this section that the actor engaged in\n      the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under this\n      section is:\n             (1) a Class C misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is less than $100;\n             (2) a Class B misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $100 or more\n             but less than $750;\n             (3) a Class A misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $750 or more\n             but less than $2,500;\n             (4) a state jail felony if the value of the property or service is $2,500 or more but\n             less than $30,000;\n             (5) a felony of the third degree if the value of the property or service is $30,000 or\n             more but less than $150,000;\n\f                                                                                  Green & Lennox \u2013 4\n\n\noffense-classification provisions when, based on the facts of a given case, an offense could\n\nfall either under the value ladder in subsection (e-1) (based on the defendant\u2019s purpose of\n\nobtaining property or services), or the type-of-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e)\n\n(based on the particular type of writing at issue), with the offense potentially receiving a\n\nvastly different classification and range of punishment depending on which subsection\n\napplies.\n\n       This question was first presented to the Sixth Court of Appeals in two separate cases.\n\nSee State v. Green, 613 S.W.3d 571 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2020); Lennox v. State, 613\n\nS.W.3d 597 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2020) (op. on reh\u2019g). Though the cases are\n\nprocedurally distinguishable, in both cases the defendants were charged with felonies under\n\nthe type-of-writing provisions in Section 32.21(d) and (e). Each defendant argued that he\n\nwas instead entitled to be prosecuted and convicted under the value ladder in subsection\n\n(e-1), based on his purpose of obtaining property through the forgery. Notably, if the value\n\nladder were held to apply, each defendant\u2019s offense would have been classified as a Class\n\nC or Class B misdemeanor, given the relatively low dollar value of the property at issue.\n\n       To resolve this issue, the court of appeals reached three main conclusions about\n\nSection 32.21, as amended:\n\n       (1)      The \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in subsections (d) and (e) means\n                that those provisions are subservient to the provisions in subsection (e-1);\n\n             (6) a felony of the second degree if the value of the property or service is $150,000\n             or more but less than $300,000; and\n             (7) a felony of the first degree if the value of the property or service is $300,000 or\n             more.\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21 (emphasis added).\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 5\n\n\n             thus, when subsection (e-1) applies to the facts of the case (i.e., the defendant\n             committed forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d), the\n             offense classifications in subsection (e-1) control over those in subsections\n             (d) or (e). Green, 613 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n      (2)    Subsection (e-1) constitutes a statutory element that must be litigated at the\n             guilt phase of trial, rather than a punishment-phase issue. Id. at 590.\n\n      (3)    Because Subsection (e-1) is controlling over Subsections (d) and (e), if the\n             State wants to bypass the value ladder in subsection (e-1) to instead bring a\n             forgery prosecution under the felony provisions in Subsections (d) or (e), it\n             must negate applicability of the value ladder by alleging and proving that the\n             defendant had a non-property-related \u201cpurpose\u201d for committing the forgery.\n             Id. at 595.\n\nThe court of appeals reached this final conclusion in spite of the fact that the statutory\n\nlanguage in Subsections (d) and (e) contains no \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement\u2014only subsection\n\n(e-1)\u2019s value ladder contains such a requirement. Nevertheless, the court of appeals\n\nreasoned that applying a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element was required in forgery\n\nprosecutions under subsections (d) or (e) because the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d effectively\n\noperates as an \u201cenhancing element\u201d that raises the possible range of punishment, such that\n\ndue process principles under Apprendi v. New Jersey would require the State to allege and\n\nprove this aggravating fact at trial. Id. at 596 (citing 530 U.S. 466 (2000)). Under this\n\nunderstanding of the statutory requirements, the court of appeals ruled in favor of the\n\ndefendants in both cases. Green, 613 S.W.3d at 597; Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 607.\n\n      We commend the court of appeals\u2019 efforts to untangle the highly complex issues\n\ncreated by the amendments to Section 32.21, but we agree only in part with its analysis.\n\nWe agree that the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e) means\n\nthat those provisions are subordinate to subsection (e-1) whenever the facts necessary to\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 6\n\n\ntrigger (e-1) are present. We further agree that (e-1) constitutes an element of the offense\n\nrather than a punishment-phase issue. But we disagree on two points: (1) the court\u2019s\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, and (2) its adoption of a non-statutory\n\n\u201cpurpose\u201d element for all forgery cases brought under subsections (d) or (e).\n\n       The court of appeals\u2019 approach in these cases was based on a misunderstanding of\n\nSection 32.21\u2019s structure. The statute contains four separate forgery offenses in subsections\n\n(b), (d), (e), and (e-1). Each subsection constitutes a facially valid offense that the State\n\nmay rely upon in charging a forgery by tracking the statutory language. Contrary to the\n\ncourt of appeals\u2019 reasoning, subsections (d) and (e) do not function as enhancing elements\n\nto an offense under subsection (e-1). Because Apprendi applies only to enhancing elements\n\nand has no application where entirely separate offenses are at issue, the court of appeals\u2019\n\nanalysis under Apprendi was flawed. Accordingly, if the State seeks to bring a felony\n\nforgery prosecution under Section 32.21(d) or (e), it may simply track the statutory\n\nlanguage. It is not required to allege and prove a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element to show\n\nthat the value ladder is inapplicable.\n\n       However, if a defendant is charged for felony forgery under subsections (d) or (e)\n\nbut the facts at trial ultimately show that he \u201cengaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt\n\nto obtain a property or service,\u201d see TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1), then we agree that,\n\ngiven the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e), a defendant\n\nis entitled to be convicted and punished under the provisions in the value ladder, if doing\n\nso would result in a reduced offense classification and range of punishment. Under those\n\ncircumstances, the State has effectively charged the defendant under the wrong statutory\n\f                                                                           Green & Lennox \u2013 7\n\n\nsubsection within Section 32.21. The defendant may raise such an issue at trial, and such\n\nerror may be remedied by the trial court or on appeal, subject to any applicable preservation\n\nrequirements.\n\n       Because the court of appeals operated under a mistaken understanding of the\n\nstructure of Section 32.21 and the requirements of Apprendi, we vacate its decision in both\n\ncases and remand for further proceedings under the appropriate framework as set forth\n\nmore fully below.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Although the consolidated cases before us both pertain to the proper interpretation\n\nof the Texas forgery statute, each case presents this question in a different procedural\n\nposture. We address the relevant background for each case below.\n\n       A.       State v. Green\n\n       Appellee Trenton Kyle Green was indicted on one count of third-degree felony\n\nforgery under Penal Code Section 32.21(e) for forging currency. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n\n32.21(e) (stating that \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony\n\nof the third degree if the writing is or purports to be . . . part of an issue of money\u201d). The\n\nindictment alleged that Green made a counterfeit $20 bill and did so \u201cwith the intent to\n\ndefraud or harm another.\u201d See id. \u00a7 32.21(b). Nothing in the indictment addressed Green\u2019s\n\npurpose for the forgery or, specifically, whether he engaged in the forgery to obtain\n\nproperty or services.\n\n       Green filed a pretrial motion to quash the indictment. In his motion, Green noted\n\nthat the facts would show he attempted to pass a counterfeit $20 bill in exchange for a $2\n\f                                                                            Green & Lennox \u2013 8\n\n\ncigarette lighter. He asserted that the allegations that he \u201cmade\u201d counterfeit currency and\n\nthat he forged the writing with the \u201cintent to defraud or harm another\u201d would require\n\nshowing that he committed the forgery to obtain property or services. Therefore, Green\n\nargued that he must be prosecuted under subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, requiring a Class\n\nC misdemeanor charge rather than a third-degree-felony charge under subsection (e). See\n\nid. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1) (\u201cIf it is shown on the trial of an offense under this section that the actor\n\nengaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under\n\nthis section is . . . a Class C misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is less than\n\n$100.\u201d). Green further argued that the district court does not have misdemeanor\n\njurisdiction, so it lacked jurisdiction over the case. The trial court agreed and granted\n\nGreen\u2019s motion to quash. The State appealed.\n\n       On appeal, the State did not dispute Green\u2019s description of the underlying facts.\n\nInstead, it contended that Section 32.21 afforded it prosecutorial discretion to choose under\n\nwhich subsection to proceed\u2014either subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, or subsection (e)\n\nbased on the type of writing involved. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e), (e-1). The State contended that it\n\nwas immaterial whether the evidence would ultimately show that Green attempted to use\n\nthe counterfeit $20 bill to obtain property because that issue had no bearing on his liability\n\nfor felony forgery of currency under subsection (e). Alternatively, the State argued that\n\nGreen\u2019s indictment alleged a \u201cfacially valid\u201d and complete felony offense, notwithstanding\n\nthe Legislature\u2019s addition of subsection (e-1) to Section 32.21. Thus, it asserted, even if the\n\nvalue ladder might ultimately apply to Green\u2019s offense once the facts were adduced at trial,\n\nno such factual development had yet occurred, and a subsection (e-1) inquiry into Green\u2019s\n\f                                                                                  Green & Lennox \u2013 9\n\n\npurpose for committing forgery would require the trial court to improperly look beyond\n\nthe four corners of the indictment.\n\n        The court of appeals rejected the State\u2019s arguments. Regarding prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion, the court of appeals held that the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) is mandatory\n\nwhenever the defendant engages in forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or\n\nservice;\u201d the State does not have discretion to bypass subsection (e-1). Green, 613 S.W.3d\n\nat 583. The textual basis for this conclusion was the amended language making subsections\n\n(d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1).\u201d Id. The court of appeals found that this language\n\n\u201cunambiguously expressed [the Legislature\u2019s] intent that, if the defendant\u2019s offense fits\n\nwithin the specific language of subsection (e-1)\u2014i.e., if it is shown at trial that the\n\ndefendant \u2018engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u2019\u2014\n\nthen he must be prosecuted under the applicable provision of subsection (e-1).\u201d Id. 2\n\n        But the court of appeals recognized that this conclusion did not fully resolve how\n\nthe competing subsections within Section 32.21 should apply in practice. To address this,\n\nthe court first considered the possibility that the Legislature intended for subsection (e-1)\n\nto operate as a punishment-phase issue. Id. at 590. The court, however, rejected this\n\ninterpretation and instead held that subsection (e-1) was intended to operate as an element\n\n\n\n2\n  In reaching its conclusion that the provisions in subsection (e-1) are not discretionary, the court\nof appeals additionally considered several extra-textual factors, including the in pari materia\ndoctrine, the vagueness doctrine, and the consequences of the State\u2019s proposed construction. See\nGreen, 613 S.W.3d at 583\u201389. As we explain further below, we find that the \u201csubject to\u201d clause\nin subsections (d) and (e) is plain in indicating that those subsections are subservient to (e-1), such\nthat (e-1) controls in the event of a conflict. Therefore, resort to extratextual factors for this aspect\nof our statutory analysis is unnecessary, and we do not review these portions of the court of\nappeals\u2019 analysis.\n\f                                                                          Green & Lennox \u2013 10\n\n\nof the offense of forgery. Id. To explain its reasoning, the court relied on this Court\u2019s\n\ndecision in Oliva v. State and determined that, although subsection (e-1) uses language\n\ntypically associated with punishment issues (i.e., \u201cif it is shown on the trial of an offense\u201d),\n\ntwo other considerations signaled that (e-1) should be treated as an element of the offense:\n\nFirst, the \u201c\u2018statutory aggravating fact would be part of the circumstances of the offense on\n\ntrial,\u2019\u201d and second, subsection (e-1) does not use the words \u201cpunished\u201d or \u201cpunishable\u201d but\n\ninstead provides that an offense is a particular grade of misdemeanor or felony. Id. at 590\u2013\n\n91 (quoting Oliva v. State, 548 S.W.3d 518, 530 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018)).\n\n       Having found that subsection (e-1) was an element rather than a punishment issue,\n\nthe court of appeals then held that the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) meant that forgeries could be \u201ccharged under subsections (d) and\n\n(e) only when they cannot be charged under subsection (e-1).\u201d Id. at 591. Under this\n\nunderstanding of the statutory framework, the court of appeals determined that, to bring a\n\nsuccessful prosecution under subsections (d) or (e), the State \u201cmust prove that the\n\ndefendant forged the writing for a different purpose other than \u2018to obtain or attempt to\n\nobtain a property or service,\u2019\u201d thereby proving that the value ladder in (e-1) was\n\ninapplicable. Id. at 592 (emphasis added).\n\n       Finally, in Part III of its opinion, the court of appeals considered what the State must\n\nallege in a forgery indictment to properly bring a prosecution under the felony provisions\n\nin subsections (d) or (e). Id. at 593. The court recognized that an indictment that tracks the\n\nstatutory elements is ordinarily sufficient, but it noted that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment sometimes requires that additional matters be alleged in the\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 11\n\n\nindictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 595 (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S.\n\nat 469, 490 (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d)). Relying on this principle, the court of\n\nappeals reasoned that because all forgery offenses could be as low as a Class C\n\nmisdemeanor under Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, if the State instead sought to pursue a\n\nfelony conviction under subsections (d) or (e), it must allege in the indictment and prove\n\nthe aggravating fact that would carry the defendant\u2019s offense beyond the scope of the value\n\nladder and permit prosecution under subsections (d) or (e)\u2014that is, \u201cthat the defendant\n\nforged the writing for a different purpose other than \u2018to obtain or attempt to obtain a\n\nproperty or service.\u2019\u201d Id. at 592 (emphasis added); see also id. at 596 (\u201cWhere a forgery\n\nunder the value ladder in subsection (e-1) would be a misdemeanor, the defendant\u2019s\n\npurpose in forging the writing is the \u2018core criminal offense element\u2019 that elevates the\n\noffense classification in a prosecution under subsection (d) or (e). Therefore,\n\nunder Apprendi, the State must prove this enhancing element beyond a reasonable doubt .\n\n. . [and] must allege this enhancing element in the indictment.\u201d).\n\n       Applying this conclusion to Green\u2019s case, the court of appeals held that the\n\nindictment alleging an offense under subsection (e) for felony forgery of currency was\n\ndeficient because it \u201cfailed to allege Green\u2019s purpose in forging the twenty-dollar bill,\u201d and\n\ntherefore failed to apprise him of whether the facts alleged would give rise to a Class C\n\nmisdemeanor or a third-degree felony offense. Id. at 597. The court further determined that,\n\nbecause the offense could in fact be a Class C misdemeanor, it was impossible to determine\n\f                                                                           Green & Lennox \u2013 12\n\n\nfrom the face of the indictment whether the offense was a felony over which the trial court\n\nhad jurisdiction. Id. The court accordingly upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling granting the\n\nmotion to quash. Id.\n\n       B.     Lennox v. State\n\n       The court of appeals issued its opinion in Lennox on the same day as its opinion in\n\nGreen, relying in large part on its reasoning from Green to resolve the issues in Lennox.\n\nSee Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 597. 3 Unlike the situation in Green, however, Lennox did not\n\nfile any pretrial motion to quash. Instead, he was tried and convicted on three counts of\n\nstate-jail felony forgery under Section 32.21(d) for forging stolen checks in the amounts of\n\n$137, $130, and $150 and passing them at a convenience store. See TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7\n\n32.21(d) (stating that \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state\n\njail felony if the writing is or purports to be a . . . check\u201d). Each count of the indictment\n\nalleged that Lennox, \u201cwith intent to defraud or harm another, pass[ed] to Nima Sherpa, a\n\nforged writing, knowing such writing to be forged, and such writing had been so made or\n\ncompleted that it purported to be the act of James McKnight, who did not authorize the act,\n\nand the writing was a check of the following tenor:\u201d The indictment then included images\n\nof the forged checks. Following his conviction, after applying punishment enhancements,\n\nLennox received a sentence of seventeen years\u2019 imprisonment on each count.\n\n\n\n\n3\n The court of appeals\u2019 opinion in Lennox that is before us on discretionary review is its opinion\non rehearing. In its original opinion, it reached a similar holding and granted Lennox a new\npunishment hearing. On rehearing, it later withdrew the original opinion and issued a substitute\nopinion.\n\f                                                                              Green & Lennox \u2013 13\n\n\n       On direct appeal, Lennox argued for the first time that his seventeen-year sentences\n\nwere illegal because, given the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) and the value of the\n\nchecks passed, his offenses were Class B misdemeanors. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(2) (providing\n\nthat \u201c[i]f it is shown on the trial of the offense . . . that the actor engaged in the conduct to\n\nobtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under this section is . . . a Class\n\nB misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $100 or more but less than $750\u201d). 4\n\nThough not raised as a freestanding point of error, Lennox also argued that the jury charge\n\nwas erroneous because it improperly charged the offenses as state-jail felonies when they\n\ninstead should have been charged as Class B misdemeanors. The court of appeals\n\nultimately treated this issue as one of unobjected-to jury-charge error. Lennox, 613 S.W.3d\n\nat 601. 5 Relying on its reasoning in Green, the court held that the guilt-phase jury charge\n\ncontained egregiously harmful error. Id. at 602. It found that, given the allegations in the\n\nindictment and the evidence presented at trial, the jury charge \u201cshould have charged the\n\noffenses as class B misdemeanors\u201d under the value ladder in subsection (e-1). Id. at 604.\n\n\n\n4\n Lennox also argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the ability to pay court-\nappointed attorney\u2019s fees and that the trial court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on\nhis motion for new trial. Given its decision to remand for a new punishment hearing based on\nharmful jury-charge error, the court of appeals did not reach these two additional issues. Lennox,\n613 S.W.3d at 600.\n5\n  Though recognizing that Lennox had not expressly raised a claim of jury-charge error, the court\nof appeals determined that the issue was \u201cfairly raised\u201d in the course of his arguments pertaining\nto his illegal-sentence claim. Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 601. The court further reasoned, \u201c[W]here\nthere is jury-charge error, we may address the question, even if the error is unassigned, and can\nreverse if the error caused egregious harm.\u201d Id. at 601\u201302 (citations omitted). The State has not\nchallenged the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 reframing of Lennox\u2019s issue as jury-charge error\nin this proceeding on discretionary review, and thus we do not directly consider that issue in this\nopinion.\n\f                                                                                  Green & Lennox \u2013 14\n\n\nFurther, because Lennox\u2019s purpose in forging the checks was the element that would\n\n\u201celevate the offense from a class B misdemeanor under subsection (e-1)(2) to a state-jail\n\nfelony under subsection (d), the failure to ask the jury to resolve that issue was error under\n\nApprendi[.]\u201d Id. (citing 530 U.S. at 469). Because Lennox did not object to the jury charge\n\nat trial, the court then examined the record for harm and found the error to be egregiously\n\nharmful. Id. at 604\u201305. Accordingly, the court of appeals reformed the judgments of\n\nconviction to three Class B misdemeanors and remanded the case to the trial court to hold\n\na new punishment trial. Id. at 607. 6\n\n         After the State sought discretionary review in each case, this Court granted review\n\nand consolidated the cases. 7\n\n\n6\n  Justice Burgess, who authored the majority opinion in Green, concurred in Lennox. See 613\nS.W.3d at 607 (Burgess, J., concurring). He opined that because the evidence adduced at trial\n\u201c\u2018effectively put [the trial court] on notice that the appellant was being prosecuted under the wrong\nstatutory provision,\u2019 [ ] the trial court had an obligation to \u2018take[ ] steps to assure that the [defendant\nwas] not being prosecuted, and more critically, punished, under the wrong statutory provision.\u2019\u201d\nId. at 612 (quoting Azeez v. State, 248 S.W.3d 182, 194 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)). Thus, in Justice\nBurgess\u2019 view, because the trial court should have sua sponte charged the jury on the Class B\nmisdemeanor offense under subsection (e-1)(2), the charge was erroneous for omitting such an\ninstruction. Id. at 613.\n7\n    The grounds on which we granted review in Green are,\n\n      1) The Court of Appeals decided an important question of state law that has not been, but\n         should be, settled by the Court of Criminal Appeals, concerning whether the value ladder\n         provisions of Section 32.21(e-1) of the Texas Penal Code are mandatory or whether those\n         provisions only apply when specifically pled by the State.\n\n      2) The Court of Appeals decided an important question of state law that has not been, but\n         should be, settled by the Court of Criminal Appeals, concerning whether the defendant\u2019s\n         purpose for committing the forgery offense is an element of the offense under Section\n         32.21(e) of the Texas Penal Code.\n\nIn Lennox, the sole ground for review is:\n\f                                                                            Green & Lennox \u2013 15\n\n\nII.    Analysis of Section 32.21\n\n       On discretionary review, the State raises different arguments in each case in\n\nopposition to the court of appeals\u2019 holdings. In Green, the State re-urges its position that\n\nSection 32.21(e-1)\u2019s value ladder is a \u201cdiscretionary provision which can be alleged or not\n\nat the discretion of the prosecution.\u201d It contends that this conclusion is supported by the\n\nstatute\u2019s plain language and that, in holding otherwise, the court of appeals misconstrued\n\nthe \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e). Alternatively, the\n\nState contends that even if the value ladder is mandatory when raised by the facts, any such\n\nfacts would not arise until the evidence is presented at trial. Accordingly, because the\n\nfelony provisions in subsections (d) and (e) remain facially valid offenses, the indictment\n\nin Green\u2019s case tracking the statutory language in subsection (e) \u201cstill alleged a valid\n\noffense under Section 32.21(e) and thus should not have been quashed.\u201d The State further\n\nasserts that neither Apprendi nor the language of subsections (d) or (e) requires the State to\n\nallege the defendant\u2019s purpose for committing forgery in a prosecution under those\n\nsubsections. Thus, there was \u201cno justification for the court of appeals to write an additional\n\nelement concerning a defendant\u2019s motive into Section 32.21(e).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n       From the appellate court\u2019s statutory construction of section 32.21(e-1) of the Texas\n       Penal Code, there was no jury charge error; but more importantly, this Court should\n       resolve a jurisdictional conflict that now exists in Texas law as to how county and\n       district attorneys in the State of Texas should correctly charge and prosecute\n       criminal offenses for forgery of financial instruments\u2014specifically, checks, which,\n       as writings, serve a historic role in the forgery statute in Texas jurisprudence and\n       the economies of Texas and the United States of America.\n\f                                                                            Green & Lennox \u2013 16\n\n\n       By contrast, in Lennox, the State takes the position that the Legislature intended for\n\nthe value ladder in subsection (e-1) to operate as a punishment issue, rather than as an\n\nelement of the offense of forgery. Under this proposed construction, the State could charge\n\na forgery offense under the felony provisions in Section 32.21(d) or (e), and then, at the\n\npunishment phase, the defense could raise an issue under subsection (e-1) as a means of\n\nreducing the offense to a misdemeanor under the value ladder. 8 Under this interpretation,\n\nthe State contends that the court of appeals erred by finding jury-charge error in Lennox\u2019s\n\ncase because the offenses were properly charged as state-jail felonies at the guilt phase,\n\nand Lennox did not raise any objection at the punishment phase asking for a defensive jury\n\ninstruction under subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder.\n\n       At the outset, we reject the State\u2019s argument in Green that the value ladder is a\n\ndiscretionary provision that applies only when the State chooses to invoke it. The statutory\n\nlanguage making subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d plainly requires\n\nthat, whenever the triggering clause of subsection (e-1) is satisfied (that is, when the facts\n\nshow that the defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property\n\nor service\u201d), the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) control over those in subsections\n\n(d) or (e), and the offense level must be determined by the value of the property or services\n\nat issue. We also reject the State\u2019s argument in Lennox that subsection (e-1) constitutes a\n\npunishment issue rather than an element. Instead, after reviewing the approach outlined in\n\n\n8\n  The State, however, concedes that when the value ladder operates as an aggravating provision\nthat would increase the offense classification beyond the state-jail and third-degree felony levels\nset forth in subsections (d) and (e), the purpose and amount requirements of subsection (e-1) are\nelements that must be alleged in the indictment to satisfy notice and due process requirements.\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 17\n\n\nour decision in Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 528, we hold that subsection (e-1) sets forth an\n\nelement of a distinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense. We do, however,\n\nagree with the State\u2019s alternative argument in Green that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, which resulted in it improperly applying\n\na non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element in felony forgery cases brought under subsections (d)\n\nand (e). Accordingly, while we agree in part with the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning, we vacate\n\nits decisions in both cases and remand for further proceedings.\n\n       A.     Law of Statutory Interpretation\n\n       Statutory construction is a question of law that we review de novo. Stahmann v.\n\nState, 602 S.W.3d 573, 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020). In interpreting statutes, we focus our\n\nattention on the literal text of the statute in question and attempt to discern the fair,\n\nobjective meaning of the text at the time of its enactment. Watkins v. State, 619 S.W.3d\n\n265, 271\u201372 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021). We must presume that every word in a statute has\n\nbeen used for a purpose and that each word, phrase, clause, and sentence should be given\n\neffect if reasonably possible. Id. at 272. We read words and phrases in context and construe\n\nthem according to rules of grammar and common usage. Stahmann, 602 S.W.3d at 577. In\n\nconstruing an amended statute, we consider the statutory language as if it had originally\n\nbeen enacted in its amended form, mindful that the Legislature, by amending the statute,\n\nmay have altered or clarified the meaning of earlier provisions. Watkins, 619 S.W.3d at\n\n272.\n\n       When the language of the statute is ambiguous or leads to absurd results, we may\n\nconsider extra-textual factors in interpreting the statute. Cortez v. State, 469 S.W.3d 593,\n\f                                                                           Green & Lennox \u2013 18\n\n\n598 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). A statute is ambiguous when it may be understood by\n\nreasonably well-informed persons to have two or more different interpretations. Id. Extra-\n\ntextual factors that we may consider to resolve ambiguity include: (1) the object sought to\n\nbe attained by the Legislature; (2) the circumstances under which the statute was enacted;\n\n(3) the legislative history; (4) the common law or former statutory provisions, including\n\nlaws on the same or similar subjects; (5) the consequences of a particular construction; (6)\n\nthe administrative construction of the statute; and (7) the title or caption, preamble, and\n\nany emergency provision.

Because the amendment is\napplicable only to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2023, we do not directly consider\nit here.\n\f                                                                  Green & Lennox \u2013 19\n\n\n(e) Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony of\nthe third degree if the writing is or purports to be:\n       (1) part of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps;\n       (2) a government record listed in Section 37.01(2)(C); or\n       (3) other instruments issued by a state or national government or by a\n       subdivision of either, or part of an issue of stock, bonds, or other\n       instruments representing interests in or claims against another person.\n(e-1) If it is shown on the trial of an offense under this section that the actor\nengaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service,\nan offense under this section is:\n       (1) a Class C misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is\n       less than $100;\n       (2) a Class B misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is\n       $100 or more but less than $750;\n       (3) a Class A misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is\n       $750 or more but less than $2,500;\n       (4) a state jail felony if the value of the property or service is $2,500\n       or more but less than $30,000;\n       (5) a felony of the third degree if the value of the property or service\n       is $30,000 or more but less than $150,000;\n       (6) a felony of the second degree if the value of the property or service\n       is $150,000 or more but less than $300,000; and\n       (7) a felony of the first degree if the value of the property or service\n       is $300,000 or more.\n(e-2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an offense under\nthis section, other than an offense described for purposes of punishment by\nSubsection (e-1)(7), is increased to the next higher category of offense if it is\nshown on the trial of the offense that the offense was committed against an\nelderly individual as defined by Section 22.04.\n(f) A person is presumed to intend to defraud or harm another if the person\nacts with respect to two or more writings of the same type and if each writing\nis a government record listed in Section 37.01(2)(C).\n\f                                                                                 Green & Lennox \u2013 20\n\n\n          (g) If conduct that constitutes an offense under this section also constitutes\n          an offense under any other law, the actor may be prosecuted under this\n          section or the other law.\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21 (emphasis added). 10\n\n          We make several initial observations about the statutory language and structure:\n\n          \u2022      Subsection (b) sets forth the core prohibited conduct that must be alleged and\n                 proven in all forgery cases: \u201cA person commits an offense if he forges a\n                 writing with intent to defraud or harm another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 32.21(b).\n\n          \u2022      Subsection (c) provides that the offense is a Class A misdemeanor, \u201c[e]xcept\n                 as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (e-1).\u201d Id. \u00a7 32.21(c). Thus, the\n\n10\n     The statute additionally includes the following definitions for \u201cforge\u201d and \u201cwriting\u201d:\n          (a) For purposes of this section:\n                 (1) \u201cForge\u201d means:\n                         (A) to alter, make, complete, execute, or authenticate any writing so\n                         that it purports:\n                                 (i) to be the act of another who did not authorize that act;\n                                 (ii) to have been executed at a time or place or in a numbered\n                                 sequence other than was in fact the case; or\n                                 (iii) to be a copy of an original when no such original existed;\n                         (B) to issue, transfer, register the transfer of, pass, publish, or\n                         otherwise utter a writing that is forged within the meaning of\n                         Paragraph (A); or\n                         (C) to possess a writing that is forged within the meaning of\n                         Paragraph (A) with intent to utter it in a manner specified in\n                         Paragraph (B).\n                 (2) \u201cWriting\u201d includes:\n                         (A) printing or any other method of recording information;\n                         (B) money, coins, tokens, stamps, seals, credit cards, badges, and\n                         trademarks; and\n                         (C) symbols of value, right, privilege, or identification.\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(a).\n\f                                                                          Green & Lennox \u2013 21\n\n\n              default offense classification is a Class A misdemeanor, and subsections (d),\n              (e), and (e-1) are grouped together as exceptions to the default classification.\n\n       \u2022      Subsections (d) and (e) are based upon a finding that the defendant forged a\n              particular type of writing (i.e., \u201cif the writing is or purports to be\u201d one of the\n              enumerated types of writings).\n\n       \u2022      In contrast, Subsection (e-1) is based upon the defendant\u2019s motive or purpose\n              for committing the forgery (that is, whether he \u201cengaged in the conduct to\n              obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d).\n\n       \u2022      Notably, subsection (e-1) is worded quite differently from subsections (d)\n              and (e). Specifically, subsection (e-1) begins with the phrase, \u201cIf it is shown\n              on the trial of an offense under this section,\u201d whereas subsections (d) and (e)\n              contain no such language.\n\n       \u2022      Yet, subsections (d) and (e) both contain a significant prefatory clause that\n              subsection (e-1) does not\u2014each begins with language stipulating that its\n              provisions are \u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1).\u201d\n\n       \u2022      However, subsections (d), (e), and (e-1) do all have at least one thing in\n              common\u2014they all alter the actual offense level by providing that an offense\n              \u201cis\u201d of a particular grade, rather than providing that an offense should be\n              \u201cpunished as\u201d or \u201cpunishable as\u201d some other grade of offense.\n\n       \u2022      Whereas subsections (d) and (e) fix the offense level at either a state-jail\n              felony or third-degree felony, respectively, the value ladder in subsection (e-\n              1) contains a wide range of possible offense levels, from a Class C\n              misdemeanor to a first-degree felony, depending on the value of the property\n              or services at issue.\n\n       \u2022      The value ladder in subsection (e-1) has the unusual feature of being able to\n              either reduce the offense classification to lower than the Class A\n              misdemeanor default, or to raise the offense level all the way to a first-degree\n              felony. Given this feature of the statute, it is apparent that the value ladder\n              may operate as a double-edged sword for criminal defendants\u2014for offenses\n              involving low-dollar-value property or services, the value ladder can\n              significantly reduce the degree of an offense as compared to the state-jail and\n              third-degree felony provisions in subsections (d) and (e); but for offenses\n              involving high-dollar-value property and services, the opposite is true.\n\n       With these general observations in mind, we now turn to consider the court of\n\nappeals\u2019 statutory analysis and the parties\u2019 arguments addressing it.\n\f                                                                                  Green & Lennox \u2013 22\n\n\n          C.     The \u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in Subsections (d) and (e)\n                 means the value ladder is not discretionary.\n\n          We will first address the State\u2019s argument that the value ladder in subsection (e-1)\n\nis a tool to be invoked in the prosecution\u2019s discretion, rather than a mandatory provision\n\nthat applies whenever a defendant forges a writing to obtain property or services.\n\n                 1. \u201cSubject to\u201d has a plain meaning in this context.\n\n          In support of its analysis of this argument, the court of appeals cited two civil cases\n\ninterpreting statutory provisions where one provision was \u201csubject to\u201d another. See Green,\n\n613 S.W.3d at 577 (citing R.R. St. & Co. v. Pilgrim Enters., 166 S.W.3d 232, 247 (Tex.\n\n2005); In re Houston Cty. ex rel. Session, 515 S.W.3d 334, 336 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler 2015)).\n\nIn R.R. St. & Co., the Texas Supreme Court considered the phrase \u201csubject to\u201d as it appears\n\nin the definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. See R.R. St.\n\n& Co, 166 S.W.3d at 247 (citing TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE \u00a7 361.003(34)) (providing\n\na definition for \u201csolid waste\u201d that was \u201c[s]ubject to the limitations of 42 U.S.C. Section\n\n6903(27) and 40 C.F.R. Section 261.4(a)\u201d). 11 The Texas Supreme Court noted that this\n\n\n\n\n11\n     The complete statutory provision at issue in R.R. St. & Co. stated,\n\n          (34) Subject to the limitations of 42 U.S.C. Section 6903(27) and 40 C.F.R. Section\n          261.4(a), \u2018solid waste\u2019 means garbage, rubbish, refuse, sludge from a waste\n          treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, and\n          other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous\n          material resulting from industrial, municipal, commercial, mining, and agricultural\n          operations and from community and institutional activities. The term:\n                 (A) does not include:\n                         (i) solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage . . . ; and . . .\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 23\n\n\nphrasing was \u201cplain\u201d in signaling the Legislature\u2019s intent to \u201climit the definition of solid\n\nwaste\u201d through the aforementioned federal provisions. Id. at 248.\n\n       In In re Houston Cty., 515 S.W.3d at 336, the Tyler Court of Appeals considered\n\nthe introductory phrase, \u201cSubject to the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d\n\nin Texas Family Code Section 81.0075. See TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 81.0075 (\u201cSubject to the\n\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, a prosecuting attorney is not precluded\n\nfrom representing a party in a proceeding under this subtitle and the Department of Family\n\nand Protective Services in another action involving the party, regardless of whether the\n\nproceeding under this subtitle occurs before, concurrently with, or after the other action\n\ninvolving the party.\u201d). The Tyler court reasoned that, \u201c\u2018[u]sed in the ordinary sense,\n\n\u2018subject to\u2019 means \u2018subordinate to,\u2019 \u2018subservient to,\u2019 or \u2018limited by.\u2019\u201d In re Houston Cty.,\n\n515 S.W.3d at 341 (quoting Cockrell v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 299 S.W.2d 672, 676 (Tex.\n\n1956)). Thus, the Tyler court held that the introductory \u201csubject to\u201d clause meant that the\n\nsubsequent provisions addressing permissible representation were limited by, and were\n\nsubservient to, the Disciplinary Rules. Id. (\u201c\u2018[S]ubject to\u2019 unambiguously indicates that the\n\nspecific language relating to the Texas disciplinary rules limits Section 81.0075\u2019s general\n\nlanguage describing the permitted representation\u201d; \u201cthe unambiguous language of the\n\nstatute reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to authorize the representation described in Section\n\n81.0075 unless the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits it\u201d).\n\n\n              (B) does include hazardous substances for the purposes of Sections\n              361.271 through 361.277, 361.280, and 361.343 through 361.345.\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE \u00a7 361.003(34) (emphasis added).\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 24\n\n\n       We agree that the ordinary use of \u201csubject to\u201d means subordinate to, subservient to,\n\nor limited by. See In re Houston Cty., 515 S.W.3d at 341; see also Cockrell, 299 S.W.2d\n\nat 676-77 (stating that \u201ca \u2018subject to\u2019 clause is a limiting clause, and a qualifying term\u201d).\n\nOr, as other courts have held, the phrase may also logically be understood to mean \u201cnot in\n\nconflict with.\u201d See State ex rel. White v. Bradley, 956 S.W.2d 725, 738\u201339 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nFort Worth 1997), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 990 S.W.3d 245 (Tex. 1999) (citing City of\n\nPortland v. Jackson, 850 P.2d 1093, 1094 (Or. 1993)). Applying these ordinary meanings\n\nin this context, the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in Section 32.21(d) and (e) means\n\nthat those provisions are limited by, and are subservient to, the competing offense-\n\nclassification provisions in subsection (e-1). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(d), (e)\n\n(\u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a [state-jail felony or third-\n\ndegree felony] if the writing is or purports to be\u201d one of the enumerated types) (emphasis\n\nadded). The result is that, if the facts of a given forgery offense could fall either under the\n\nvalue ladder in subsection (e-1) (because the defendant \u201cengaged in the conduct to obtain\n\nor attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d), or the type-of-writing provisions in subsections\n\n(d) or (e) (based on the type of writing involved), then the offense classifications in\n\nsubsection (e-1) trump those in subsections (d) or (e), and the offense classification must\n\nbe based on the value of any property or services at issue. The State has no discretion to\n\navoid this result.\n\n       In seeking to refute this conclusion, the State in Green points to subsection (g) of\n\nSection 32.21, which states that \u201c[i]f conduct that constitutes an offense under this section\n\nalso constitutes an offense under any other law, the actor may be prosecuted under this\n\f                                                                              Green & Lennox \u2013 25\n\n\nsection or the other law.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(g) (emphasis added). The State\n\ncontends that the Legislature\u2019s decision to retain subsection (g), notwithstanding the\n\naddition of subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, signals legislative intent to allow significant\n\nprosecutorial discretion in the charging of forgeries\u2014including by allowing prosecutors to\n\nbypass the provisions in subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder in favor of the felony provisions\n\nin subsection (d) or (e). We disagree. While Subsection (g) affords prosecutors discretion\n\nto bring charges under any other applicable provision outside Section 32.21, it does not\n\nspeak to the ability of prosecutors to freely choose amongst the subsections within Section\n\n32.21. And, as we have already explained above, the \u201csubject to\u201d clause in subsections (d)\n\nand (e) provides that the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) override those found in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) whenever the defendant engages in the forgery to obtain property\n\nor services. The State offers no persuasive argument to overcome the statute\u2019s plain text in\n\nthis regard. 12\n\n\n12\n   The State also contends that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation would lead to the bizarre result\nthat the State could charge check forgers more harshly than currency forgers. This argument stems\nfrom the fact that the State could, in many cases, theoretically charge check forgers with a felony\nunder Penal Code Section 32.51 for fraudulent use of identifying information but would be limited\nto charging currency forgers under the misdemeanor provisions in the value ladder. See TEX.\nPENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 32.51(c) (setting forth felony ranges of punishment for fraudulent use of\nidentifying information); 32.21(e-1)(1)-(3) (setting forth misdemeanor ranges of punishment under\nthe value ladder). Because we have determined that the language in Section 32.21 is plain in\nrefuting the State\u2019s position that the value ladder is discretionary, we need not consider this\nargument. See, e.g., State v. Neesley, 239 S.W.3d 780, 783 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (stating that\nwe will consider extratextual factors only when the statute\u2019s plain language \u201c\u2018would lead to absurd\nresults, or if the language is not plain but rather ambiguous\u2019\u201d) (quoting Boykin v. State, 818 S.W.2d\n782 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)). But, even were we to consider this argument, we would not find it\npersuasive. The purpose served by Section 32.51, protecting people from identity theft, is distinct\nfrom the purpose served by Section 32.21(e-1), which is to protect the recipient of the forged\nwriting against loss of property or services. Given this fact, it is not illogical or absurd to have\ndifferent punishments to protect these different interests.\n\f                                                                                 Green & Lennox \u2013 26\n\n\n                 2. Legislative history supports holding that the value ladder is\n                    mandatory when raised by the facts.\n\n          Even assuming arguendo that Section 32.21 is ambiguous on this point, the relevant\n\nlegislative history accompanying enactment of Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder supports the\n\nsame conclusion. The Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 1824 indicates that the 2017\n\namendments to Section 32.21 were intended to bring the forgery penalties into conformity\n\nwith the penalties for other property crimes that use a similar value ladder offense-\n\nclassification system. 13 Specifically, the legislative history reflects a particular concern that\n\n\n\n13\n     See Bill Analysis, Senate Research Center, S.B. 1824, April 21, 2017. The Bill Analysis states,\n\n          Last session, the governor signed H.B. 1396, which updated the property crime\n          thresholds to reflect twenty years of inflation. . . . However, the charge of forgery\n          was unintentionally left out of the threshold adjustment. S.B. 1824 corrects this\n          oversight and updates the threshold ladder for forgery crimes related to fake checks,\n          money orders, and other simple transactions to match the penalty ladder for the rest\n          of Texas\u2019 theft offenses.\n\n          S.B. 1824 amends Section 32.21, Penal Code, to bring the offense of forgery in line\n          with the damage amounts for all other property crimes, including the similar crime\n          of theft by check. . . . Current law designates forgery by check, or \u201cfake checks,\u201d to\n          be an automatic state jail felony, along with writings that pretend to be a will, deed,\n          mortgage, or security agreement. Forgery of a will is a far more serious offense\n          than forgery of a check for a small dollar amount. Many forgery charges resulting\n          in a state jail sentence relate to simple check forgery in an amount that would\n          otherwise qualify as misdemeanor under the property threshold structure. Some of\n          these convictions are first-time offenders. Moreover, very similar check-related\n          offenses, trying to cash a hot check or write a bad check for goods and services,\n          were included in the property crime threshold adjustment from last session. S.B.\n          1824 creates consistency with other check-related offenses and keeps non-violent\n          offenders, many of whom are first time offenders, out of Texas state jails.\n\nId. (emphasis added). We note here that the provisions in Section 32.21(e-1) were originally\nproposed in Senate Bill 1824. However, the provisions were ultimately added through a floor\namendment to another bill, House Bill 351. See Acts 2017, 85th Leg., ch. 977 (H.B. 351), \u00a7 25,\neff. Sept. 1, 2017.\n\f                                                                              Green & Lennox \u2013 27\n\n\nsmall-dollar forgery offenses were being punished more harshly than other similar property\n\ncrimes, such as theft by check. 14 While the legislative history reflects a desire to reduce the\n\npenalties for small-dollar forgery offenses, nothing about this history implies that the\n\nLegislature intended to afford the State discretion to bypass the misdemeanor provisions\n\nin the value ladder in favor of pursuing a felony conviction under subsections (d) or (e).\n\n               3. Conclusion: The provisions in subsection (e-1) are mandatory\n                  rather than discretionary.\n\n       Accordingly, we uphold this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis in which it\n\nconcluded that the provisions in subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder are not discretionary but\n\nare instead mandatory when raised by the facts. Thus, if the facts of the offense show that\n\nthe defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service,\u201d\n\nsee TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1), the offense-classification provisions in subsection (e-\n\n1) control over those in subsections (d) and (e) in the event of a conflict.\n\n       D.      Subsection (e-1) is a statutory element, rather than a punishment issue.\n\n       We now address the issue presented in Green regarding how subsection (e-1) should\n\noperate in practice. One aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis of this question was a\n\nconsideration of whether subsection (e-1) was intended to operate as a punishment-phase\n\nissue, or whether it instead operates as an element of forgery that must be pled in the\n\nindictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase. Green, 613 S.W.3d at\n\n\n\n14\n  See, e.g., TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31.03(e) (value ladder for theft setting forth offense classifications\nsimilar to those contained within Section 32.21(e-1), with offense classifications ranging from a\nClass C misdemeanor for theft of property valued at less than $100 to a first-degree felony for theft\nof property valued at over $300,000).\n\f                                                                              Green & Lennox \u2013 28\n\n\n590. In resolving this issue, the court of appeals relied on our opinion in Oliva, 548 S.W.3d\n\nat 528, and concluded that subsection (e-1) constitutes an element of the offense, rather\n\nthan a punishment provision. See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 592. 15 We agree.\n\n               1.      Oliva v. State\n\n       In Oliva, this Court examined whether, under Penal Code Section 49.09, entitled\n\n\u201cEnhanced Offenses and Penalties\u201d related to DWI offenses, 16 subsection (a)\u2014the offense\n\nelevation for DWI offenses after a single prior DWI conviction\u2014served as an element of\n\nan offense or a punishment issue. See 548 S.W.3d 518. At the outset of our analysis in\n\nOliva, we examined a number of textual factors that are relevant to such a determination,\n\nincluding: (1) whether the statute had any \u201cexplicit labeling\u201d designating something as an\n\nelement or punishment issue; (2) whether the provision included the phrase, \u201cA person\n\ncommits an offense if,\u201d which is the most \u201cobvious and common method of prescribing\n\nelements of an offense;\u201d (3) whether the statute increased the actual offense level by\n\nproviding that an offense \u201cis\u201d of a particular grade or instead merely provided that an\n\noffense was punishable under some higher category; (4) whether the provision included\n\n\n15\n  Even though this conclusion was reached by the court of appeals in Green, it is only in Lennox\nthat the State has challenged this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis on discretionary review;\nthe State in Green concedes that (e-1) must function as an element. While the State in Lennox\nargues that (e-1) was intended to operate as a punishment issue, it also seems to concede that\nwhenever (e-1) would apply to aggravate the defendant\u2019s offense level beyond the default offense\nlevel, it must function as an element in those cases to comport with due process. However, the\nState views the applicable \u201cdefault\u201d for these purposes as being set forth by the third-degree felony\nprovision in subsection (e), rather than the Class A misdemeanor default under subsection (c).\n16\n  See TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7 49.09(a) (\u201cExcept as provided by Subsection (b), an offense under Section\n49.04, 49.05, 49.06, or 49.065 is a Class A misdemeanor, with a minimum term of confinement of\n30 days, if it is shown on the trial of the offense that the person has previously been convicted one\ntime of\u201d one of the enumerated intoxication offenses).\n\f                                                                              Green & Lennox \u2013 29\n\n\nthe phrase, \u201cif it is shown on the trial of,\u201d which is a prefatory phrase \u201cstrongly associated\n\nwith punishment enhancements;\u201d and (5) whether the provision is jurisdictional, in that an\n\naffirmative finding would raise the offense level from a misdemeanor range to a felony\n\nrange such that jurisdiction in the district court would be proper. Id. at 522\u201329. 17 Finding\n\nthat these factors, on balance, did not provide any conclusive answer as to whether the\n\nprovision in Section 49.09(a) should be treated as an element or a punishment issue, we\n\nproceeded to consider extra-textual factors. Id. at 529\u201333.\n\n       One focus of our analysis was on the distinction between prior-conviction\n\nenhancement provisions and provisions involving fact issues that were \u201cpart of the\n\ncircumstances of the offense on trial.\u201d Id. at 529\u201330. We noted that the fact of a prior\n\nconviction is excluded from the constitutional right to a jury trial under Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey. Id. at 529 (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490). But, due process requires that other\n\ntypes of fact issues that would raise the maximum punishment for an offense must be\n\nsubmitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 530. In view of this\n\ndistinction, we suggested that there was a risk of constitutional error inherent in trying the\n\n\n17\n  In another portion of our analysis in Oliva, we summarized the holdings of our prior cases\naddressing similar issues as follows:\n\n       Under our cases, then, the words \u201cpunished for,\u201d \u201cpunishable by,\u201d or similar\n       language ordinarily mark an enhancing provision as a punishment issue. The status\n       of an enhancing provision as a prior-conviction provision, on the other hand, is\n       some indication of a punishment issue but is not conclusive. But the inference that\n       a prior-conviction provision is a punishment issue becomes much stronger when it\n       includes \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language, and that inference is further\n       strengthened if it is also true that the provision is contained in an entirely separate\n       section from the section that more obviously prescribes the elements of the offense.\n\nOliva, 548 S.W.3d at 532.\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 30\n\n\nlatter type of issue at the punishment phase, because by that point a defendant has a\n\nforfeitable, statutory-only right to a jury determination under Texas law. Id. (observing that\n\nthe forfeitable nature of the statutory right to a jury trial at the punishment phase in non-\n\ncapital cases \u201cmight complicate trying at the punishment stage an issue to which the\n\nconstitutional right to a jury trial attaches\u201d). Based on this concern, we concluded that, if\n\n\u201cthe statutory aggravating fact would be part of the circumstances of the offense on trial,\u201d\n\nrather than a prior-conviction enhancement, \u201cthat would be a factor in favor of construing\n\nthe statutory aggravating fact as an element of the offense.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       A second focus of our extra-textual analysis in Oliva was on jurisdictional\n\nconsiderations. Citing our prior decision in Ex parte Benson, 459 S.W.3d 67 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2015), we suggested that, where a provision raises the offense level from a\n\nmisdemeanor to a felony range, invoking such provision at the pleading stage is necessary\n\nto demonstrate that the district court has jurisdiction, and therefore such provisions must\n\nbe treated as elemental rather than as punishment issues. Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 533\n\n(observing that Benson \u201crejected the notion that there is a special category of\n\n\u2018jurisdictional\u2019 elements that are not elements for all purposes\u201d). Thus, even in the context\n\nof the prior-conviction enhancements that were at issue in Benson, \u201csomething that would\n\notherwise be a punishment issue must become an element because it is jurisdictional.\u201d Id.\n\n(emphasis added). Applying these considerations to the provision at issue in Oliva, we\n\nultimately concluded that, on balance, the \u201cvarious factors suggest[ed] that the legislature\n\nintended that \u00a7 49.09(a) prescribe a punishment issue\u201d\u2014both because it was a prior-\n\nconviction provision that did not implicate Apprendi considerations, and because the\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 31\n\n\noffense would remain a misdemeanor even if the provision applied and so it was not\n\njurisdictional. Id. at 534.\n\n                2.     Application of Oliva Considerations to Section 32.21(e-1)\n\n         We recognize as an initial matter that Section 32.21(e-1) is quite different from the\n\nprovision that was at issue in Oliva. Oliva involved a traditional prior-conviction\n\naggravating provision, whereas the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) does not solely\n\noperate as an aggravating provision; rather, it has the ability to either decrease or increase\n\nthe offense level from the Class A misdemeanor default, depending on the value of the\n\nproperty or services at issue. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1)\u2013(7). This feature of\n\nthe statute complicates our analysis somewhat, but we nevertheless find that the factors\n\nfrom Oliva apply persuasively to show that subsection (e-1) constitutes an element of a\n\ndistinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense, rather than a punishment-phase\n\nissue.\n\n                       a.     The statutory text is ambiguous.\n\n         Beginning with the statutory text itself, Section 32.21 contains no explicit language\n\nindicating whether the Legislature intended for subsection (e-1) to operate as an element\n\nor as a punishment issue. Importantly, subsection (e-1) does include the phrase, \u201cif it is\n\nshown on the trial of an offense,\u201d which is a phrase \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with punishment\n\nissues and \u201cseem[s] inherently to indicate something that is in addition to an element of the\n\noffense.\u201d Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 527. And yet, in Oliva we recognized that the inclusion of\n\nthis \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language is not conclusive evidence that something\n\nshould be treated as a punishment issue. That is because in some instances, we have held\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 32\n\n\nthat provisions including this language were elemental for other reasons. Id. at 528\n\n(observing that \u201c[i]t is not always true that this phrase . . . causes a statute to prescribe a\n\npunishment issue,\u201d and citing TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7 49.09(b)(2), and Benson, 459 S.W.3d at\n\n75-76).\n\n       Several other considerations from Oliva weigh in favor of treating (e-1) as an\n\nelement: (1) subsection (e-1) does not contain the words \u201cpunish\u201d or \u201cpunishable\u201d but\n\ninstead provides that an offense \u201cis\u201d a particular grade of felony or misdemeanor; (2) it is\n\nnot a prior-conviction enhancement provision but instead involves facts surrounding \u201cthe\n\ncircumstances of the offense on trial;\u201d and (3) it is found in the same Penal Code section\n\nas the provision defining the core forgery offense, Section 32.21(b), rather than being\n\ncontained in an entirely separate Penal Code section. See id. at 530, 532. Weighing these\n\nfactors on the whole, we find ambiguity in the statute and will therefore consider\n\nextratextual factors.\n\n                        b.   Based on Apprendi and jurisdictional considerations,\n                             the aggravating portions of the value ladder must be\n                             treated as elements.\n\n       Both the Apprendi/due process and jurisdictional considerations discussed in Oliva\n\nare highly relevant here. First, if we were to treat the provisions in (e-1) as setting forth a\n\npunishment issue, the aggravating portions of the value ladder (i.e., those that would\n\nelevate the offense level above the Class A misdemeanor default), would trigger the\n\nrequirements of Apprendi because the facts at issue\u2014whether the defendant engaged in the\n\nconduct to obtain property or services and the value of any property or services at issue\u2014\n\nare facts that increase the maximum potential punishment for forgery. See TEX. PENAL\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 33\n\n\nCODE \u00a7 32.21(c) (providing that base-level forgery offense is Class A misdemeanor, except\n\nas provided by subsections (d), (e), and (e-1)); (e-1)(4)\u2013(7) (setting forth felony offense\n\nclassifications under the value ladder ranging from state-jail felony to first-degree felony);\n\nsee also Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\n\nany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\n\nmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). This factor weighs\n\nheavily in favor of treating at least the aggravating portions of the value ladder as elements\n\nto protect against possible violations of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury\n\ndetermination of these facts. See Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 529\u201330.\n\n       And yet, of even greater importance to our analysis is the fact that the aggravating\n\nportions of the value ladder can elevate forgery from a misdemeanor to a felony offense.\n\nSee TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(4)\u2013(7) (value-ladder provisions setting forth state-jail\n\nthrough first-degree felony offense classifications for any forgery involving property or\n\nservices valued at more than $2,500). Thus, the State could invoke these aggravating\n\nportions of the value ladder at the pleading stage to demonstrate that the offense is a felony\n\nover which the district court has jurisdiction. Under those circumstances, such an allegation\n\nunder (e-1) would constitute a jurisdictional element, which, as we indicated in Oliva, must\n\nbe treated as an element for all purposes. Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 533; see also Holoman v.\n\nState, 620 S.W.3d 141, 145\u201346 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021) (explaining that when an\n\naggravating fact \u201craises the offense level from a misdemeanor to a felony, thus conferring\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction upon a different court,\u201d such a \u201cjurisdictional aggravating fact\n\nwill always be considered elemental, not punishment-only\u201d). Given these considerations,\n\f                                                                      Green & Lennox \u2013 34\n\n\nwe conclude that at least the felony provisions in the value ladder (i.e., Section 32.21(e-\n\n1)(4)\u2013(7)) must be treated as elemental rather than as punishment issues.\n\n                     c.     Additional considerations signal that the\n                            misdemeanor provisions in the value ladder must\n                            also be treated as elements.\n\n      But what of the remaining portions of the value ladder that do not aggravate but\n\ninstead can actually reduce the offense level to below the Class A misdemeanor default?\n\nSee TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1)\u2013(3) (providing for Class A, B, and C misdemeanor\n\noffense classifications for forgery offenses involving attempts to obtain goods or services\n\nvalued at less than $2,500). In those instances, neither Apprendi nor jurisdictional\n\nconsiderations would be implicated. The question then becomes whether, despite treating\n\nthe aggravating portions of the value ladder as elements, see id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(4)\u2013(7), we\n\nshould nevertheless treat the misdemeanor provisions within the value ladder as mere\n\npunishment provisions.\n\n      We decline to adopt such an awkward construction of Section 32.21(e-1) that would\n\nin effect \u201csplit\u201d the value ladder in two, with the felony provisions constituting\n\njurisdictional elements and the misdemeanor provisions constituting punishment issues.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the Legislature would have intended such a cumbersome\n\nresult. In reaching this conclusion, we rely on Holoman, 620 S.W.3d at 145\u201347.\n\n                            i.     Holoman v. State\n\n       In Holoman, when faced with a similar question about the prior-conviction\n\naggravating provision for family-violence assault found in Penal Code Section\n\n22.01(b)(2)(A), we declined to adopt the State\u2019s proposed construction that would have\n\f                                                                               Green & Lennox \u2013 35\n\n\nallowed that provision to operate \u201ceither elementally, or as a punishment provision only,\n\ndepending on the vicissitudes of the particular case.\u201d Id. at 147. 18 Instead, we held that the\n\nprovision must consistently operate only as an element. Id. The State had conceded that\n\nSection 22.01(b)(2)(A) could sometimes operate as a jurisdictional element that must be\n\npled in the indictment and proven at the guilt phase\u2014but if it was not invoked for that\n\npurpose in a particular case, then under those circumstances the State argued that it could\n\ninstead operate as a punishment issue. Id. at 144. 19 We declared the State\u2019s construction to\n\nbe \u201codd and unwieldy,\u201d such that it was unlikely the Legislature would have intended it.\n\nId. at 147. In reaching our decision, we cited Oliva and observed that the neighboring\n\nprovision in Section 22.01(b)(2)(B), which raises assault on a family member to a third-\n\n\n\n18\n   See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 22.01(b)(2)(A) (providing that misdemeanor assault is elevated to a\nthird-degree felony \u201cif it is shown on the trial of the offense that the defendant has been previously\nconvicted of\u201d one of the enumerated family-violence offenses) (emphasis added). Though our\nanalysis in Holoman did not place much emphasis on the \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language\nin Section 22.02(b)(2)(A), the fact that we ultimately determined that provision to be elemental in\nspite of the inclusion of that phrase provides additional support for our holding here today.\n19\n   The State had charged Holoman with misdemeanor assault, elevated to a third-degree felony\nunder Penal Code Section 22.01(b)(2)(B). Holoman, 620 S.W.3d at 142; see TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n22.01(b)(2)(B) (providing that assault on a family member is elevated to a third-degree felony if\n\u201cthe offense is committed by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impeding the normal\nbreathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person\u2019s throat or\nneck or by blocking the person\u2019s nose or mouth[.]\u201d). But, the jury declined to find that aggravating\nfact at the guilt phase and instead convicted Holoman of the lesser offense of misdemeanor assault.\nHoloman, 620 S.W.3d at 143. At the punishment phase, however, the State sought to enhance\nHoloman\u2019s offense to a third-degree felony by alleging that he had a prior family-violence assault\nconviction under the neighboring provision in Section 22.01(b)(2)(A). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n22.01(b)(2)(A) (providing that assault on a family member is a third-degree felony if \u201cit is shown\non the trial of the offense that the defendant has been previously convicted of\u201d one of the\nenumerated family-violence offenses). Thus, the precise question presented was whether the State\ncould rely upon the prior-conviction provision in subsection (b)(2)(A) at the punishment phase to\nelevate Holoman\u2019s offense to a third-degree felony after the jury had already rejected the other\naggravating facts alleged under (b)(2)(B) during the guilt phase.\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 36\n\n\ndegree felony if the defendant committed the offense by impeding the victim\u2019s breathing\n\nor blood circulation, was almost certainly \u201ccategorically elemental\u201d because it was part of\n\nthe circumstances of the offense on trial. Id. (citing Oliva, 548 S.W.3d at 530). We declined\n\nto adopt the State\u2019s \u201clopsided\u201d construction of the statute, wherein one of the aggravating\n\nprovisions in Section 22.01(b)(2) would be elemental in all instances while the other could\n\nsometimes be elemental and sometimes operate as a punishment issue. Id. We concluded\n\nthat Section 22.01(b)(2)(A) was \u201can element of an aggravated crime and not, alternatively,\n\na punishment enhancement.\u201d Id.\n\n       Although Holoman is distinguishable from this case in some key respects, the broad\n\nprinciples underlying that decision nevertheless apply here. Just as we rejected the State\u2019s\n\nproposed construction in Holoman as \u201codd and unwieldy,\u201d we believe it would be similarly\n\nawkward here, and therefore likely contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intended construction, to\n\nhold that the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) sometimes operates as an element and\n\nsometimes operates as a punishment issue, depending on the value of the property or\n\nservices involved in the forgery offense. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1)\u2013(7).\n\n                            ii.    Consequences       of    the     State\u2019s    proposed\n                                   construction\n\n       We also take into consideration the consequences of the State\u2019s proposed\n\nconstruction. Were we to treat the misdemeanor portions of subsection (e-1) as punishment\n\nprovisions, the practical effect would be to undermine one of the value ladder\u2019s apparent\n\npurposes of reducing the penalties for forgery offenses committed to obtain low-dollar-\n\nvalue goods or services. See n. 13, supra (referencing Bill Analysis stating that the value\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 37\n\n\nladder was enacted, in part, to reduce the penalties for low-dollar-value forgery offenses\n\nand to keep such offenders \u201cout of state jail\u201d). This is because, under that construction, the\n\nState could routinely charge such offenses under the felony type-of-writing provisions in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e), only for those offenses to eventually be reduced to misdemeanors\n\nat the punishment phase through application of the value ladder. But by then, in many\n\ninstances, such defendants would have already spent a significant amount of time in pretrial\n\ncustody\u2014likely exceeding the maximum permissible punishment for misdemeanor\n\nforgery. 20 The court of appeals emphasized this consideration in its analysis of these issues,\n\nhighlighting the example of Green\u2019s case, wherein he spent five months incarcerated before\n\nthe trial court granted his motion to quash. See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 587\u201389. We agree\n\nwith the court of appeals that it is highly unlikely the Legislature would have intended for\n\noffenders who commit forgery to obtain low-dollar-value goods or services to be initially\n\ncharged with felonies, only to have their offenses reduced to misdemeanors at the\n\npunishment phase (and even then, only if they raise an issue under Subsection (e-1) as a\n\ndefensive matter).\n\n              3.     Conclusion: Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder must operate as an\n                     element rather than as a punishment issue.\n\n       In sum, we think it improbable that the Legislature would have intended for\n\nsubsection (e-1) to sometimes operate as a jurisdictional element (i.e., whenever it\n\naggravates a forgery offense above the Class A misdemeanor default level into the felony\n\n\n20\n  See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 12.21\u201312.23 (setting forth misdemeanor punishments ranging from a\nmaximum $500 fine only for Class C misdemeanors, up to confinement for a year and a maximum\n$4,000 fine for a Class A misdemeanor).\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 38\n\n\nrange), and sometimes operate as a defensive punishment issue (i.e., whenever it serves to\n\nreduce the defendant\u2019s offense level). We decline to adopt such an awkward interpretation\n\nof the statute that is unsupported by the statutory text, legislative history, or practical\n\nconsiderations. Accordingly, we reject the State\u2019s position in Lennox that subsection (e-1)\n\nwas intended to operate as a punishment issue. We instead conclude that subsection (e-1)\n\nconstitutes an element of a distinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense that may\n\nresult in either an aggravated or reduced offense level as compared to the Class A\n\nmisdemeanor default.\n\n       E.     The court of appeals erred in its application of Apprendi\n              principles.\n\n       In spite of our broad agreement with the court of appeals\u2019 analysis up to this point,\n\nwe part ways with the lower court in its understanding of how due process principles under\n\nApprendi affect the practical operation of Section 32.21. In particular, the court of appeals\n\nheld that after the addition of subsection (e-1) to the statute, due process principles would\n\nrequire the State to plead and prove a new non-statutory element in all forgery cases\n\nbrought under subsections (d) or (e)\u2014that is, the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d for committing the\n\nforgery\u2014because the defendant\u2019s non-property-related purpose was the \u201cenhancing\n\nelement\u201d that would permit prosecution under the aggravated provisions in subsections (d)\n\nand (e). See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 596. We conclude that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, and we therefore reject its adoption of\n\na non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element that was based on that analysis.\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 39\n\n\n       In Apprendi, the Supreme Court examined a New Jersey \u201chate crime\u201d statute that\n\nauthorized the trial judge, at the punishment phase, to impose an increased range of\n\npunishment for an offense if the judge determined by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nthe defendant committed the offense with the intent to intimidate a person or group of\n\npersons because of their race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or\n\nethnicity. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 468. The New Jersey courts had upheld the statute,\n\nreasoning that such a practice was permissible because the statute set forth a mere\n\n\u201csentencing factor,\u201d rather than an element of a criminal offense. Id. at 471. The Supreme\n\nCourt rejected this reasoning and held that the statute violated due process. Id. at 490. In\n\ndoing so, it set forth the seminal rule that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any\n\nfact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must\n\nbe submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\u2014and this is true regardless\n\nof whether such \u201cfact\u201d is labeled as an element or sentencing factor. Id. at 490 (emphasis\n\nadded). The problem with the hate crime statute, therefore, was that it \u201c\u2018remove[d] from\n\nthe jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a\n\ncriminal defendant is exposed\u2019\u201d by labeling those facts as mere sentencing factors that the\n\njudge could decide and apply at the punishment phase. Id. (quoting Jones v. United States,\n\n526 U.S. 227, 252-53 (1999) (Stevens, J., concurring)).\n\n       The focus of the Apprendi rule is on ensuring that a criminal defendant receives a\n\njury determination on any fact that can increase his range of punishment for a specific\n\ncrime. Applying that rule requires us to define the pertinent \u201ccrime,\u201d the \u201cprescribed\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 40\n\n\nstatutory maximum\u201d sentence for that crime, and the fact that would \u201cincrease[ ] the\n\npenalty\u201d for that crime beyond the statutory maximum. Id.\n\n       In the context of the forgery statute, our understanding of the structure of Section\n\n32.21 is that it effectively sets forth four distinct forgery \u201ccrimes,\u201d each with a different\n\nstatutory maximum punishment: (1) the base-level Class A misdemeanor offense under\n\nsubsection (b) (a defendant commits an offense if he \u201cforges a writing with intent to defraud\n\nor harm another\u201d); (2 & 3) the state-jail and third-degree felony provisions in subsections\n\n(d) and (e), each of which requires proof of the base-level offense in subsection (b) plus\n\nthe additional fact that the defendant forged a particular type of writing; and, finally, (4)\n\nthe forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense in subsection (e-1), which requires\n\nproof of the base-level offense plus facts showing that the defendant \u201cengaged in the\n\nconduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d and the value of the property\n\nor services at issue, which determines the offense level. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(b), (d),\n\n(e), (e-1). Based on the statutory structure, the State could prosecute a forgery under any\n\nof these discrete subsections by alleging and proving the statutory elements necessary to\n\nprove each offense. An Apprendi problem would arise only if the State later sought to\n\nintroduce some additional \u201cfact\u201d (other than the fact of a prior conviction), to be decided\n\nby the trial judge, that would result in a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum\n\npunishment prescribed by the particular subsection under which the defendant was charged\n\nand convicted. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d 655, 664 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201cThe\n\nconstitutional rule of Apprendi does not apply where the sentence imposed is not greater\n\nthan the prescribed statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.\u201d).\n\f                                                                             Green & Lennox \u2013 41\n\n\n       From the foregoing discussion, the flaws in the court of appeals\u2019 application of\n\nApprendi principles to this situation become readily apparent. The court viewed Section\n\n32.21 as setting forth one single forgery \u201ccrime\u201d for which the base-level range of\n\npunishment could be as low as a Class C misdemeanor under subsection (e-1). It then\n\nfurther reasoned that the felony type-of-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e)\n\nfunctioned as \u201cenhancing elements\u201d to this base-level offense. This reasoning was\n\nerroneous because Section 32.21 contains not one but four distinct forgery offenses, each\n\nwith a different applicable range of punishment for Apprendi purposes. Accordingly,\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) do not function as \u201cenhancing elements\u201d to an offense under\n\nsubsection (e-1)\u2014they are entirely separate offenses. See, e.g., Juarez v. State, 198 S.W.3d\n\n790, 794 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (rejecting Apprendi complaint raised under former Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure Article 62.10(b)(3) because the provisions at issue \u201cdescribe[d]\n\nseparate offenses and are not enhancement provisions\u201d).\n\n       Based on this mistaken understanding of the structure of Section 32.21 and the\n\nrequirements of Apprendi, the court of appeals read a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element into\n\nsubsections (d) and (e)\u2014purportedly to satisfy the due process requirement that the State\n\nallege and prove the \u201cenhancing element\u201d that would permit an increased punishment\n\nunder subsections (d) or (e). See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 596. 21 But, even setting aside the\n\n\n\n\n21\n  On this point the court of appeals stated: \u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s purpose in forging the writing [for\nsome reason other than to obtain property or services] is the \u2018core criminal offense \u2018element\u2019\u2019 that\nelevates the offense classification in a prosecution under subsection (d) or (e). Therefore,\nunder Apprendi, the State must prove this enhancing element beyond a reasonable doubt, and . . .\nmust allege this enhancing element in the indictment.\u201d 613 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n\f                                                                        Green & Lennox \u2013 42\n\n\nother problems with the court\u2019s reasoning, we are unaware of any authority that would\n\nsupport applying Apprendi in this manner to impose an additional non-statutory\n\nrequirement for an \u201cenhancing\u201d element. Indeed, such an approach appears to be entirely\n\nnovel. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to Section 32.21. Accordingly, we reject the court\u2019s\n\nholding requiring the State to allege and prove a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element for felony\n\nforgery cases brought under Section 32.21(d) and (e). We agree with the State\u2019s position\n\nthat subsections (d) and (e) remain complete and valid offenses that the State may rely\n\nupon in prosecuting a forgery, even after the addition of subsection (e-1), without the need\n\nto read any additional non-statutory requirements into those provisions.\n\nIII.   Summary and Conclusion \u2013 Harmonizing the Competing Offense-\n       Classification Provisions in Section 32.21\n\n       To summarize our understanding of how Section 32.21 should operate in light of\n\nthe Legislature\u2019s 2017 amendments, we set forth the following three conclusions:\n\n       First, by adding subsection (e-1) to Section 32.21, and by making the felony type-\n\nof-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1),\u201d the\n\nLegislature plainly signaled its intent that, whenever the triggering terms in subsection (e-\n\n1) are satisfied (i.e., the defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a\n\nproperty or service\u201d), the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) must control over those\n\nin subsections (d) and (e) in the event of a conflict. We understand this statutory structure\n\nto effectively operate as a codification of the in pari materia doctrine. See, e.g., Azeez v.\n\nState, 248 S.W.3d 182, 192 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (observing that \u201ca defendant has a due\n\f                                                                         Green & Lennox \u2013 43\n\n\nprocess right to be prosecuted under a \u2018special\u2019 statute that is in pari materia with a broader\n\nstatute when these statutes irreconcilably conflict\u201d); see also Diruzzo v. State, 581 S.W.3d\n\n788 (Tex. Crim. App. 2019) (holding that the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s\n\npretrial motion to quash where the indictment showed, on its face, that he was being\n\nprosecuted under the incorrect statutory provision). As a practical matter, this means that\n\nif the State charges a forgery offense under subsections (d) or (e) of Section 32.21, but the\n\nfacts show that the defendant\u2019s offense also falls under the value ladder in subsection (e-1)\n\nand (e-1) would result in a reduced offense classification, then the defendant is entitled to\n\nbe convicted and punished under subsection (e-1). Under those circumstances, he may raise\n\na claim that he is being prosecuted under the wrong statutory subsection as a basis for\n\nhaving his offense reduced under the value ladder. We expressly do not decide at this\n\njuncture whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant may raise such a claim\n\npretrial based on the facts alleged in the indictment, as opposed to only being able to raise\n\nsuch a claim after the facts have been adduced at trial. We similarly do not decide at this\n\ntime what preservation requirements would apply to such a claim that the defendant is\n\nbeing prosecuted under the wrong statutory subsection. The parties did not fully brief these\n\nissues on discretionary review, and we believe these issues are better addressed in the\n\ncourse of resolving the merits of these cases. Accordingly, we leave it to the court of\n\nappeals to address these issues in the first instance on remand, to the extent doing so is\n\nnecessary to resolve the remaining issues before it.\n\n       Second, we have determined that Section 32.21(e-1) was intended to operate as a\n\nstatutory element, rather than as a punishment issue. As we have indicated above, this\n\f                                                                          Green & Lennox \u2013 44\n\n\nmeans that Section 32.21 contains four separate forgery offenses: the base-level Class A\n\nmisdemeanor offense under subsection (b); the state-jail and third-degree felony type-of-\n\nwriting offenses in subsections (d) and (e); and the forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services\n\noffense under subsection (e-1). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(b), (d), (e), (e-1). Each of\n\nthese subsections sets forth a facially valid forgery offense that the State may rely upon in\n\ncharging a forgery by tracking the statutory elements. Given our analysis of the \u201csubject\n\nto\u201d clause in subsections (d) and (e), if the State has information in its possession indicating\n\nthat a defendant committed forgery to obtain property or services, it would be the better\n\npractice for the State to charge the offense under subsection (e-1). If the State believes such\n\nfacts are not present and it opts to charge a forgery under subsections (d) or (e), then in that\n\nsituation, as we have indicated above, if the defendant believes he is being prosecuted\n\nunder the wrong subsection and is instead entitled to be prosecuted under the value ladder,\n\nhe may raise such a claim in the trial court and/or on appeal, subject to any applicable\n\npreservation requirements.\n\n       Finally, we have rejected the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Apprendi/due process\n\nprinciples require the State to plead and prove the non-statutory element of a defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201cpurpose\u201d in a forgery prosecution under Section 32.21(d) or (e). Contrary to the court of\n\nappeals\u2019 reasoning, Apprendi simply does not apply to Section 32.21 to require that result.\n\nNor does the \u201csubject to\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e) itself require the State to\n\nnegate the applicability of subsection (e-1) in a prosecution under those subsections.\n\nAlthough the language making subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d\n\neffectively restricts the scope of those subsections, we have in other contexts explained that\n\f                                                                          Green & Lennox \u2013 45\n\n\nthis type of limiting language in a statute generally does not give rise to an obligation on\n\nthe State\u2019s part to negate the limitation, unless it is expressly labeled as an \u201cexception.\u201d See\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(a) (\u201cAn exception to an offense in this code is so labeled by the\n\nphrase: \u2018It is an exception to the application of . . . .\u2019\u201d); Baumgart v. State, 512 S.W.3d 335,\n\n344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (discussing Section 2.02(a) and stating, \u201cthe legislature has\n\ndecreed that an exception exists only when [the] exact phrase [in Section 2.02(a)] is used;\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a defensive matter is not plainly labeled as an exception, defense, or an affirmative\n\ndefense, then it is a defense. . . . and defenses do not have to be negated in the charging\n\ninstrument.\u201d). Because the Legislature did not use the precise statutory language giving\n\nrise to an \u201cexception,\u201d the \u201c[s]ubject to\u201d clause in subsections (d) and (e) does not require\n\nthe State to negate applicability of subsection (e-1). See Baumgart, 512 S.W.3d at 344.\n\n       Pursuant to the foregoing conclusions, because the court of appeals\u2019 holdings were\n\nbased on its erroneous understanding of the structure of Section 32.21 and due process\n\nrequirements under Apprendi, we vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgments and remand these\n\ncauses for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nDELIVERED: January 17, 2024\n\nPUBLISH\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">         IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS\n                     OF TEXAS\n                               NO.

See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21. The statute\n\nprovides that a person commits an offense if he \u201cforges a writing with intent to defraud or\n\nharm another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 32.21(b). This base-level offense is a Class A misdemeanor. Id. \u00a7\n\n32.21(c). In 2017, the Legislature added a new subsection, (e-1), which sets forth an\n\nalternative \u201cvalue ladder\u201d offense-classification scheme. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1). Pursuant to\n\nthis value-ladder provision, \u201c[i]f it is shown on the trial of an offense that the actor engaged\n\nin the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service,\u201d then the offense\n\nclassification is based on the value of any property or services at issue. Id. The possible\n\noffense level starts at a Class C misdemeanor (for forgeries involving property or services\n\nvalued at less than $100) and extends to a first-degree felony (for forgeries involving\n\nproperty or services valued at over $300,000). Id. This value-ladder provision, however,\n\ndid not replace two original subsections in Section 32.21 setting forth exceptions to the\n\ndefault offense classification\u2014subsections (d) and (e). Those original subsections\n\nindependently provide that forgery of a specified type of writing (regardless of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s purpose for committing forgery or the value of any goods or services involved)\n\nis a state-jail felony or a third-degree felony, respectively. See id. \u00a7 32.21(d) (providing\n\nthat it is a state-jail felony to commit forgery of one of the enumerated types of financial\n\ninstruments), (e) (providing that it is a third-degree felony to commit forgery of currency\n\nor other governmental records or instruments). But the 2017 amendments also added\n\f                                                                                   Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 3\n\n\nlanguage to subsections (d) and (e) stating that those provisions are \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection\n\n(e-1).\u201d Id. 1 The question we must resolve here is how to apply Section 32.21\u2019s competing\n\n\n\n1\n    The relevant portions of Section 32.21 provide:\n\n      (b) A person commits an offense if he forges a writing with intent to defraud or harm\n      another.\n\n      (c) Except as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (e-1), an offense under this section is a\n      Class A misdemeanor.\n\n      (d) Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state jail felony if the\n      writing is or purports to be a will, codicil, deed, deed of trust, mortgage, security\n      instrument, security agreement, credit card, check, authorization to debit an account at a\n      financial institution, or similar sight order for payment of money, contract, release, or other\n      commercial instrument.\n      (e) Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony of the third degree\n      if the writing is or purports to be:\n             (1) part of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps;\n             (2) a government record listed in Section 37.01(2)(C); or\n             (3) other instruments issued by a state or national government or by a subdivision\n             of either, or part of an issue of stock, bonds, or other instruments representing\n             interests in or claims against another person.\n      (e-1) If it is shown on the trial of an offense under this section that the actor engaged in\n      the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under this\n      section is:\n             (1) a Class C misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is less than $100;\n             (2) a Class B misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $100 or more\n             but less than $750;\n             (3) a Class A misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $750 or more\n             but less than $2,500;\n             (4) a state jail felony if the value of the property or service is $2,500 or more but\n             less than $30,000;\n             (5) a felony of the third degree if the value of the property or service is $30,000 or\n             more but less than $150,000;\n\f                                                                                  Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 4\n\n\noffense-classification provisions when, based on the facts of a given case, an offense could\n\nfall either under the value ladder in subsection (e-1) (based on the defendant\u2019s purpose of\n\nobtaining property or services), or the type-of-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e)\n\n(based on the particular type of writing at issue), with the offense potentially receiving a\n\nvastly different classification and range of punishment depending on which subsection\n\napplies.\n\n       This question was first presented to the Sixth Court of Appeals in two separate cases.\n\nSee State v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">613 S.W.3d 571</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2020); Lennox v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">613\n\nS.W.3d 597</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2020) (op. on reh\u2019g). Though the cases are\n\nprocedurally distinguishable, in both cases the defendants were charged with felonies under\n\nthe type-of-writing provisions in Section 32.21(d) and (e). Each defendant argued that he\n\nwas instead entitled to be prosecuted and convicted under the value ladder in subsection\n\n(e-1), based on his purpose of obtaining property through the forgery. Notably, if the value\n\nladder were held to apply, each defendant\u2019s offense would have been classified as a Class\n\nC or Class B misdemeanor, given the relatively low dollar value of the property at issue.\n\n       To resolve this issue, the court of appeals reached three main conclusions about\n\nSection 32.21, as amended:\n\n       (1)      The \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in subsections (d) and (e) means\n                that those provisions are subservient to the provisions in subsection (e-1);\n\n             (6) a felony of the second degree if the value of the property or service is $150,000\n             or more but less than $300,000; and\n             (7) a felony of the first degree if the value of the property or service is $300,000 or\n             more.\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21 (emphasis added).\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 5\n\n\n             thus, when subsection (e-1) applies to the facts of the case (i.e., the defendant\n             committed forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d), the\n             offense classifications in subsection (e-1) control over those in subsections\n             (d) or (e). Green, 613 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n      (2)    Subsection (e-1) constitutes a statutory element that must be litigated at the\n             guilt phase of trial, rather than a punishment-phase issue. Id. at 590.\n\n      (3)    Because Subsection (e-1) is controlling over Subsections (d) and (e), if the\n             State wants to bypass the value ladder in subsection (e-1) to instead bring a\n             forgery prosecution under the felony provisions in Subsections (d) or (e), it\n             must negate applicability of the value ladder by alleging and proving that the\n             defendant had a non-property-related \u201cpurpose\u201d for committing the forgery.\n             Id. at 595.\n\nThe court of appeals reached this final conclusion in spite of the fact that the statutory\n\nlanguage in Subsections (d) and (e) contains no \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement\u2014only subsection\n\n(e-1)\u2019s value ladder contains such a requirement. Nevertheless, the court of appeals\n\nreasoned that applying a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element was required in forgery\n\nprosecutions under subsections (d) or (e) because the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d effectively\n\noperates as an \u201cenhancing element\u201d that raises the possible range of punishment, such that\n\ndue process principles under Apprendi v. New Jersey would require the State to allege and\n\nprove this aggravating fact at trial. Id. at 596 (citing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">530 U.S. 466</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000)). Under this\n\nunderstanding of the statutory requirements, the court of appeals ruled in favor of the\n\ndefendants in both cases. Green, 613 S.W.3d at 597; Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 607.\n\n      We commend the court of appeals\u2019 efforts to untangle the highly complex issues\n\ncreated by the amendments to Section 32.21, but we agree only in part with its analysis.\n\nWe agree that the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e) means\n\nthat those provisions are subordinate to subsection (e-1) whenever the facts necessary to\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 6\n\n\ntrigger (e-1) are present. We further agree that (e-1) constitutes an element of the offense\n\nrather than a punishment-phase issue. But we disagree on two points: (1) the court\u2019s\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, and (2) its adoption of a non-statutory\n\n\u201cpurpose\u201d element for all forgery cases brought under subsections (d) or (e).\n\n       The court of appeals\u2019 approach in these cases was based on a misunderstanding of\n\nSection 32.21\u2019s structure. The statute contains four separate forgery offenses in subsections\n\n(b), (d), (e), and (e-1). Each subsection constitutes a facially valid offense that the State\n\nmay rely upon in charging a forgery by tracking the statutory language. Contrary to the\n\ncourt of appeals\u2019 reasoning, subsections (d) and (e) do not function as enhancing elements\n\nto an offense under subsection (e-1). Because Apprendi applies only to enhancing elements\n\nand has no application where entirely separate offenses are at issue, the court of appeals\u2019\n\nanalysis under Apprendi was flawed. Accordingly, if the State seeks to bring a felony\n\nforgery prosecution under Section 32.21(d) or (e), it may simply track the statutory\n\nlanguage. It is not required to allege and prove a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element to show\n\nthat the value ladder is inapplicable.\n\n       However, if a defendant is charged for felony forgery under subsections (d) or (e)\n\nbut the facts at trial ultimately show that he \u201cengaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt\n\nto obtain a property or service,\u201d see TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1), then we agree that,\n\ngiven the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e), a defendant\n\nis entitled to be convicted and punished under the provisions in the value ladder, if doing\n\nso would result in a reduced offense classification and range of punishment. Under those\n\ncircumstances, the State has effectively charged the defendant under the wrong statutory\n\f                                                                           Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 7\n\n\nsubsection within Section 32.21. The defendant may raise such an issue at trial, and such\n\nerror may be remedied by the trial court or on appeal, subject to any applicable preservation\n\nrequirements.\n\n       Because the court of appeals operated under a mistaken understanding of the\n\nstructure of Section 32.21 and the requirements of Apprendi, we vacate its decision in both\n\ncases and remand for further proceedings under the appropriate framework as set forth\n\nmore fully below.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Although the consolidated cases before us both pertain to the proper interpretation\n\nof the Texas forgery statute, each case presents this question in a different procedural\n\nposture. We address the relevant background for each case below.\n\n       A.       State v. Green\n\n       Appellee Trenton Kyle Green was indicted on one count of third-degree felony\n\nforgery under Penal Code Section 32.21(e) for forging currency. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n\n32.21(e) (stating that \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony\n\nof the third degree if the writing is or purports to be . . . part of an issue of money\u201d). The\n\nindictment alleged that Green made a counterfeit $20 bill and did so \u201cwith the intent to\n\ndefraud or harm another.\u201d See id. \u00a7 32.21(b). Nothing in the indictment addressed Green\u2019s\n\npurpose for the forgery or, specifically, whether he engaged in the forgery to obtain\n\nproperty or services.\n\n       Green filed a pretrial motion to quash the indictment. In his motion, Green noted\n\nthat the facts would show he attempted to pass a counterfeit $20 bill in exchange for a $2\n\f                                                                            Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 8\n\n\ncigarette lighter. He asserted that the allegations that he \u201cmade\u201d counterfeit currency and\n\nthat he forged the writing with the \u201cintent to defraud or harm another\u201d would require\n\nshowing that he committed the forgery to obtain property or services. Therefore, Green\n\nargued that he must be prosecuted under subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, requiring a Class\n\nC misdemeanor charge rather than a third-degree-felony charge under subsection (e). See\n\nid. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1) (\u201cIf it is shown on the trial of an offense under this section that the actor\n\nengaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under\n\nthis section is . . . a Class C misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is less than\n\n$100.\u201d). Green further argued that the district court does not have misdemeanor\n\njurisdiction, so it lacked jurisdiction over the case. The trial court agreed and granted\n\nGreen\u2019s motion to quash. The State appealed.\n\n       On appeal, the State did not dispute Green\u2019s description of the underlying facts.\n\nInstead, it contended that Section 32.21 afforded it prosecutorial discretion to choose under\n\nwhich subsection to proceed\u2014either subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, or subsection (e)\n\nbased on the type of writing involved. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e), (e-1). The State contended that it\n\nwas immaterial whether the evidence would ultimately show that Green attempted to use\n\nthe counterfeit $20 bill to obtain property because that issue had no bearing on his liability\n\nfor felony forgery of currency under subsection (e). Alternatively, the State argued that\n\nGreen\u2019s indictment alleged a \u201cfacially valid\u201d and complete felony offense, notwithstanding\n\nthe Legislature\u2019s addition of subsection (e-1) to Section 32.21. Thus, it asserted, even if the\n\nvalue ladder might ultimately apply to Green\u2019s offense once the facts were adduced at trial,\n\nno such factual development had yet occurred, and a subsection (e-1) inquiry into Green\u2019s\n\f                                                                                  Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 9\n\n\npurpose for committing forgery would require the trial court to improperly look beyond\n\nthe four corners of the indictment.\n\n        The court of appeals rejected the State\u2019s arguments. Regarding prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion, the court of appeals held that the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) is mandatory\n\nwhenever the defendant engages in forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or\n\nservice;\u201d the State does not have discretion to bypass subsection (e-1). Green, 613 S.W.3d\n\nat 583. The textual basis for this conclusion was the amended language making subsections\n\n(d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1).\u201d Id. The court of appeals found that this language\n\n\u201cunambiguously expressed [the Legislature\u2019s] intent that, if the defendant\u2019s offense fits\n\nwithin the specific language of subsection (e-1)\u2014i.e., if it is shown at trial that the\n\ndefendant \u2018engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u2019\u2014\n\nthen he must be prosecuted under the applicable provision of subsection (e-1).\u201d Id. 2\n\n        But the court of appeals recognized that this conclusion did not fully resolve how\n\nthe competing subsections within Section 32.21 should apply in practice. To address this,\n\nthe court first considered the possibility that the Legislature intended for subsection (e-1)\n\nto operate as a punishment-phase issue. Id. at 590. The court, however, rejected this\n\ninterpretation and instead held that subsection (e-1) was intended to operate as an element\n\n\n\n2\n  In reaching its conclusion that the provisions in subsection (e-1) are not discretionary, the court\nof appeals additionally considered several extra-textual factors, including the in pari materia\ndoctrine, the vagueness doctrine, and the consequences of the State\u2019s proposed construction. See\nGreen, 613 S.W.3d at 583\u201389. As we explain further below, we find that the \u201csubject to\u201d clause\nin subsections (d) and (e) is plain in indicating that those subsections are subservient to (e-1), such\nthat (e-1) controls in the event of a conflict. Therefore, resort to extratextual factors for this aspect\nof our statutory analysis is unnecessary, and we do not review these portions of the court of\nappeals\u2019 analysis.\n\f                                                                          Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 10\n\n\nof the offense of forgery. Id. To explain its reasoning, the court relied on this Court\u2019s\n\ndecision in Oliva v. State and determined that, although subsection (e-1) uses language\n\ntypically associated with punishment issues (i.e., \u201cif it is shown on the trial of an offense\u201d),\n\ntwo other considerations signaled that (e-1) should be treated as an element of the offense:\n\nFirst, the \u201c\u2018statutory aggravating fact would be part of the circumstances of the offense on\n\ntrial,\u2019\u201d and second, subsection (e-1) does not use the words \u201cpunished\u201d or \u201cpunishable\u201d but\n\ninstead provides that an offense is a particular grade of misdemeanor or felony. Id. at 590\u2013\n\n91 (quoting Oliva v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">548 S.W.3d 518</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018)).\n\n       Having found that subsection (e-1) was an element rather than a punishment issue,\n\nthe court of appeals then held that the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) meant that forgeries could be \u201ccharged under subsections (d) and\n\n(e) only when they cannot be charged under subsection (e-1).\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id. at 591</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Under this\n\nunderstanding of the statutory framework, the court of appeals determined that, to bring a\n\nsuccessful prosecution under subsections (d) or (e), the State \u201cmust prove that the\n\ndefendant forged the writing for a different purpose other than \u2018to obtain or attempt to\n\nobtain a property or service,\u2019\u201d thereby proving that the value ladder in (e-1) was\n\ninapplicable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id. at 592</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added).\n\n       Finally, in Part III of its opinion, the court of appeals considered what the State must\n\nallege in a forgery indictment to properly bring a prosecution under the felony provisions\n\nin subsections (d) or (e). </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id. at 593</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The court recognized that an indictment that tracks the\n\nstatutory elements is ordinarily sufficient, but it noted that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment sometimes requires that additional matters be alleged in the\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 11\n\n\nindictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 595 (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S.\n\nat 469, 490 (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d)). Relying on this principle, the court of\n\nappeals reasoned that because all forgery offenses could be as low as a Class C\n\nmisdemeanor under Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, if the State instead sought to pursue a\n\nfelony conviction under subsections (d) or (e), it must allege in the indictment and prove\n\nthe aggravating fact that would carry the defendant\u2019s offense beyond the scope of the value\n\nladder and permit prosecution under subsections (d) or (e)\u2014that is, \u201cthat the defendant\n\nforged the writing for a different purpose other than \u2018to obtain or attempt to obtain a\n\nproperty or service.\u2019\u201d Id. at 592 (emphasis added); see also id. at 596 (\u201cWhere a forgery\n\nunder the value ladder in subsection (e-1) would be a misdemeanor, the defendant\u2019s\n\npurpose in forging the writing is the \u2018core criminal offense element\u2019 that elevates the\n\noffense classification in a prosecution under subsection (d) or (e). Therefore,\n\nunder Apprendi, the State must prove this enhancing element beyond a reasonable doubt .\n\n. . [and] must allege this enhancing element in the indictment.\u201d).\n\n       Applying this conclusion to Green\u2019s case, the court of appeals held that the\n\nindictment alleging an offense under subsection (e) for felony forgery of currency was\n\ndeficient because it \u201cfailed to allege Green\u2019s purpose in forging the twenty-dollar bill,\u201d and\n\ntherefore failed to apprise him of whether the facts alleged would give rise to a Class C\n\nmisdemeanor or a third-degree felony offense. Id. at 597. The court further determined that,\n\nbecause the offense could in fact be a Class C misdemeanor, it was impossible to determine\n\f                                                                           Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 12\n\n\nfrom the face of the indictment whether the offense was a felony over which the trial court\n\nhad jurisdiction. Id. The court accordingly upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling granting the\n\nmotion to quash. Id.\n\n       B.     Lennox v. State\n\n       The court of appeals issued its opinion in Lennox on the same day as its opinion in\n\nGreen, relying in large part on its reasoning from Green to resolve the issues in Lennox.\n\nSee Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 597. 3 Unlike the situation in Green, however, Lennox did not\n\nfile any pretrial motion to quash. Instead, he was tried and convicted on three counts of\n\nstate-jail felony forgery under Section 32.21(d) for forging stolen checks in the amounts of\n\n$137, $130, and $150 and passing them at a convenience store. See TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7\n\n32.21(d) (stating that \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state\n\njail felony if the writing is or purports to be a . . . check\u201d). Each count of the indictment\n\nalleged that Lennox, \u201cwith intent to defraud or harm another, pass[ed] to Nima Sherpa, a\n\nforged writing, knowing such writing to be forged, and such writing had been so made or\n\ncompleted that it purported to be the act of James McKnight, who did not authorize the act,\n\nand the writing was a check of the following tenor:\u201d The indictment then included images\n\nof the forged checks. Following his conviction, after applying punishment enhancements,\n\nLennox received a sentence of seventeen years\u2019 imprisonment on each count.\n\n\n\n\n3\n The court of appeals\u2019 opinion in Lennox that is before us on discretionary review is its opinion\non rehearing. In its original opinion, it reached a similar holding and granted Lennox a new\npunishment hearing. On rehearing, it later withdrew the original opinion and issued a substitute\nopinion.\n\f                                                                              Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 13\n\n\n       On direct appeal, Lennox argued for the first time that his seventeen-year sentences\n\nwere illegal because, given the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) and the value of the\n\nchecks passed, his offenses were Class B misdemeanors. See id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(2) (providing\n\nthat \u201c[i]f it is shown on the trial of the offense . . . that the actor engaged in the conduct to\n\nobtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, an offense under this section is . . . a Class\n\nB misdemeanor if the value of the property or service is $100 or more but less than $750\u201d). 4\n\nThough not raised as a freestanding point of error, Lennox also argued that the jury charge\n\nwas erroneous because it improperly charged the offenses as state-jail felonies when they\n\ninstead should have been charged as Class B misdemeanors. The court of appeals\n\nultimately treated this issue as one of unobjected-to jury-charge error. Lennox, 613 S.W.3d\n\nat 601. 5 Relying on its reasoning in Green, the court held that the guilt-phase jury charge\n\ncontained egregiously harmful error. Id. at 602. It found that, given the allegations in the\n\nindictment and the evidence presented at trial, the jury charge \u201cshould have charged the\n\noffenses as class B misdemeanors\u201d under the value ladder in subsection (e-1). Id. at 604.\n\n\n\n4\n Lennox also argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the ability to pay court-\nappointed attorney\u2019s fees and that the trial court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on\nhis motion for new trial. Given its decision to remand for a new punishment hearing based on\nharmful jury-charge error, the court of appeals did not reach these two additional issues. Lennox,\n613 S.W.3d at 600.\n5\n  Though recognizing that Lennox had not expressly raised a claim of jury-charge error, the court\nof appeals determined that the issue was \u201cfairly raised\u201d in the course of his arguments pertaining\nto his illegal-sentence claim. Lennox, 613 S.W.3d at 601. The court further reasoned, \u201c[W]here\nthere is jury-charge error, we may address the question, even if the error is unassigned, and can\nreverse if the error caused egregious harm.\u201d Id. at 601\u201302 (citations omitted). The State has not\nchallenged the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 reframing of Lennox\u2019s issue as jury-charge error\nin this proceeding on discretionary review, and thus we do not directly consider that issue in this\nopinion.\n\f                                                                                  Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 14\n\n\nFurther, because Lennox\u2019s purpose in forging the checks was the element that would\n\n\u201celevate the offense from a class B misdemeanor under subsection (e-1)(2) to a state-jail\n\nfelony under subsection (d), the failure to ask the jury to resolve that issue was error under\n\nApprendi[.]\u201d Id. (citing 530 U.S. at 469). Because Lennox did not object to the jury charge\n\nat trial, the court then examined the record for harm and found the error to be egregiously\n\nharmful. Id. at 604\u201305. Accordingly, the court of appeals reformed the judgments of\n\nconviction to three Class B misdemeanors and remanded the case to the trial court to hold\n\na new punishment trial. Id. at 607. 6\n\n         After the State sought discretionary review in each case, this Court granted review\n\nand consolidated the cases. 7\n\n\n6\n  Justice Burgess, who authored the majority opinion in Green, concurred in Lennox. See 613\nS.W.3d at 607 (Burgess, J., concurring). He opined that because the evidence adduced at trial\n\u201c\u2018effectively put [the trial court] on notice that the appellant was being prosecuted under the wrong\nstatutory provision,\u2019 [ ] the trial court had an obligation to \u2018take[ ] steps to assure that the [defendant\nwas] not being prosecuted, and more critically, punished, under the wrong statutory provision.\u2019\u201d\nId. at 612 (quoting Azeez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382375\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382375/azeez-v-state/\">248 S.W.3d 182</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)). Thus, in Justice\nBurgess\u2019 view, because the trial court should have sua sponte charged the jury on the Class B\nmisdemeanor offense under subsection (e-1)(2), the charge was erroneous for omitting such an\ninstruction. Id. at 613.\n7\n    The grounds on which we granted review in Green are,\n\n      1) The Court of Appeals decided an important question of state law that has not been, but\n         should be, settled by the Court of Criminal Appeals, concerning whether the value ladder\n         provisions of Section 32.21(e-1) of the Texas Penal Code are mandatory or whether those\n         provisions only apply when specifically pled by the State.\n\n      2) The Court of Appeals decided an important question of state law that has not been, but\n         should be, settled by the Court of Criminal Appeals, concerning whether the defendant\u2019s\n         purpose for committing the forgery offense is an element of the offense under Section\n         32.21(e) of the Texas Penal Code.\n\nIn Lennox, the sole ground for review is:\n\f                                                                            Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 15\n\n\nII.    Analysis of Section 32.21\n\n       On discretionary review, the State raises different arguments in each case in\n\nopposition to the court of appeals\u2019 holdings. In Green, the State re-urges its position that\n\nSection 32.21(e-1)\u2019s value ladder is a \u201cdiscretionary provision which can be alleged or not\n\nat the discretion of the prosecution.\u201d It contends that this conclusion is supported by the\n\nstatute\u2019s plain language and that, in holding otherwise, the court of appeals misconstrued\n\nthe \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e). Alternatively, the\n\nState contends that even if the value ladder is mandatory when raised by the facts, any such\n\nfacts would not arise until the evidence is presented at trial. Accordingly, because the\n\nfelony provisions in subsections (d) and (e) remain facially valid offenses, the indictment\n\nin Green\u2019s case tracking the statutory language in subsection (e) \u201cstill alleged a valid\n\noffense under Section 32.21(e) and thus should not have been quashed.\u201d The State further\n\nasserts that neither Apprendi nor the language of subsections (d) or (e) requires the State to\n\nallege the defendant\u2019s purpose for committing forgery in a prosecution under those\n\nsubsections. Thus, there was \u201cno justification for the court of appeals to write an additional\n\nelement concerning a defendant\u2019s motive into Section 32.21(e).\u201d\n\n\n\n\n       From the appellate court\u2019s statutory construction of section 32.21(e-1) of the Texas\n       Penal Code, there was no jury charge error; but more importantly, this Court should\n       resolve a jurisdictional conflict that now exists in Texas law as to how county and\n       district attorneys in the State of Texas should correctly charge and prosecute\n       criminal offenses for forgery of financial instruments\u2014specifically, checks, which,\n       as writings, serve a historic role in the forgery statute in Texas jurisprudence and\n       the economies of Texas and the United States of America.\n\f                                                                            Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 16\n\n\n       By contrast, in Lennox, the State takes the position that the Legislature intended for\n\nthe value ladder in subsection (e-1) to operate as a punishment issue, rather than as an\n\nelement of the offense of forgery. Under this proposed construction, the State could charge\n\na forgery offense under the felony provisions in Section 32.21(d) or (e), and then, at the\n\npunishment phase, the defense could raise an issue under subsection (e-1) as a means of\n\nreducing the offense to a misdemeanor under the value ladder. 8 Under this interpretation,\n\nthe State contends that the court of appeals erred by finding jury-charge error in Lennox\u2019s\n\ncase because the offenses were properly charged as state-jail felonies at the guilt phase,\n\nand Lennox did not raise any objection at the punishment phase asking for a defensive jury\n\ninstruction under subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder.\n\n       At the outset, we reject the State\u2019s argument in Green that the value ladder is a\n\ndiscretionary provision that applies only when the State chooses to invoke it. The statutory\n\nlanguage making subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d plainly requires\n\nthat, whenever the triggering clause of subsection (e-1) is satisfied (that is, when the facts\n\nshow that the defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property\n\nor service\u201d), the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) control over those in subsections\n\n(d) or (e), and the offense level must be determined by the value of the property or services\n\nat issue. We also reject the State\u2019s argument in Lennox that subsection (e-1) constitutes a\n\npunishment issue rather than an element. Instead, after reviewing the approach outlined in\n\n\n8\n  The State, however, concedes that when the value ladder operates as an aggravating provision\nthat would increase the offense classification beyond the state-jail and third-degree felony levels\nset forth in subsections (d) and (e), the purpose and amount requirements of subsection (e-1) are\nelements that must be alleged in the indictment to satisfy notice and due process requirements.\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 17\n\n\nour decision in Oliva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">548 S.W.3d at 528</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we hold that subsection (e-1) sets forth an\n\nelement of a distinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense. We do, however,\n\nagree with the State\u2019s alternative argument in Green that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, which resulted in it improperly applying\n\na non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element in felony forgery cases brought under subsections (d)\n\nand (e). Accordingly, while we agree in part with the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning, we vacate\n\nits decisions in both cases and remand for further proceedings.\n\n       A.

Specifically, subsection (e-1) begins with the phrase, \u201cIf it is shown\n              on the trial of an offense under this section,\u201d whereas subsections (d) and (e)\n              contain no such language.\n\n       \u2022      Yet, subsections (d) and (e) both contain a significant prefatory clause that\n              subsection (e-1) does not\u2014each begins with language stipulating that its\n              provisions are \u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1).\u201d\n\n       \u2022      However, subsections (d), (e), and (e-1) do all have at least one thing in\n              common\u2014they all alter the actual offense level by providing that an offense\n              \u201cis\u201d of a particular grade, rather than providing that an offense should be\n              \u201cpunished as\u201d or \u201cpunishable as\u201d some other grade of offense.\n\n       \u2022      Whereas subsections (d) and (e) fix the offense level at either a state-jail\n              felony or third-degree felony, respectively, the value ladder in subsection (e-\n              1) contains a wide range of possible offense levels, from a Class C\n              misdemeanor to a first-degree felony, depending on the value of the property\n              or services at issue.\n\n       \u2022      The value ladder in subsection (e-1) has the unusual feature of being able to\n              either reduce the offense classification to lower than the Class A\n              misdemeanor default, or to raise the offense level all the way to a first-degree\n              felony. Given this feature of the statute, it is apparent that the value ladder\n              may operate as a double-edged sword for criminal defendants\u2014for offenses\n              involving low-dollar-value property or services, the value ladder can\n              significantly reduce the degree of an offense as compared to the state-jail and\n              third-degree felony provisions in subsections (d) and (e); but for offenses\n              involving high-dollar-value property and services, the opposite is true.\n\n       With these general observations in mind, we now turn to consider the court of\n\nappeals\u2019 statutory analysis and the parties\u2019 arguments addressing it.\n\f                                                                                  Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 22\n\n\n          C.     The \u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in Subsections (d) and (e)\n                 means the value ladder is not discretionary.\n\n          We will first address the State\u2019s argument that the value ladder in subsection (e-1)\n\nis a tool to be invoked in the prosecution\u2019s discretion, rather than a mandatory provision\n\nthat applies whenever a defendant forges a writing to obtain property or services.\n\n                 1. \u201cSubject to\u201d has a plain meaning in this context.\n\n          In support of its analysis of this argument, the court of appeals cited two civil cases\n\ninterpreting statutory provisions where one provision was \u201csubject to\u201d another.

Applying these ordinary meanings\n\nin this context, the \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d clause in Section 32.21(d) and (e) means\n\nthat those provisions are limited by, and are subservient to, the competing offense-\n\nclassification provisions in subsection (e-1). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(d), (e)\n\n(\u201cSubject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a [state-jail felony or third-\n\ndegree felony] if the writing is or purports to be\u201d one of the enumerated types) (emphasis\n\nadded). The result is that, if the facts of a given forgery offense could fall either under the\n\nvalue ladder in subsection (e-1) (because the defendant \u201cengaged in the conduct to obtain\n\nor attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d), or the type-of-writing provisions in subsections\n\n(d) or (e) (based on the type of writing involved), then the offense classifications in\n\nsubsection (e-1) trump those in subsections (d) or (e), and the offense classification must\n\nbe based on the value of any property or services at issue. The State has no discretion to\n\navoid this result.\n\n       In seeking to refute this conclusion, the State in Green points to subsection (g) of\n\nSection 32.21, which states that \u201c[i]f conduct that constitutes an offense under this section\n\nalso constitutes an offense under any other law, the actor may be prosecuted under this\n\f                                                                              Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 25\n\n\nsection or the other law.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(g) (emphasis added). The State\n\ncontends that the Legislature\u2019s decision to retain subsection (g), notwithstanding the\n\naddition of subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder, signals legislative intent to allow significant\n\nprosecutorial discretion in the charging of forgeries\u2014including by allowing prosecutors to\n\nbypass the provisions in subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder in favor of the felony provisions\n\nin subsection (d) or (e). We disagree. While Subsection (g) affords prosecutors discretion\n\nto bring charges under any other applicable provision outside Section 32.21, it does not\n\nspeak to the ability of prosecutors to freely choose amongst the subsections within Section\n\n32.21. And, as we have already explained above, the \u201csubject to\u201d clause in subsections (d)\n\nand (e) provides that the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) override those found in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) whenever the defendant engages in the forgery to obtain property\n\nor services. The State offers no persuasive argument to overcome the statute\u2019s plain text in\n\nthis regard. 12\n\n\n12\n   The State also contends that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation would lead to the bizarre result\nthat the State could charge check forgers more harshly than currency forgers. This argument stems\nfrom the fact that the State could, in many cases, theoretically charge check forgers with a felony\nunder Penal Code Section 32.51 for fraudulent use of identifying information but would be limited\nto charging currency forgers under the misdemeanor provisions in the value ladder. See TEX.\nPENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 32.51(c) (setting forth felony ranges of punishment for fraudulent use of\nidentifying information); 32.21(e-1)(1)-(3) (setting forth misdemeanor ranges of punishment under\nthe value ladder). Because we have determined that the language in Section 32.21 is plain in\nrefuting the State\u2019s position that the value ladder is discretionary, we need not consider this\nargument. See, e.g., State v. Neesley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2355757\"><a href=\"/opinion/2355757/state-v-neesley/\">239 S.W.3d 780</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 783 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (stating that\nwe will consider extratextual factors only when the statute\u2019s plain language \u201c\u2018would lead to absurd\nresults, or if the language is not plain but rather ambiguous\u2019\u201d) (quoting Boykin v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443077/boykin-v-state/\">818 S.W.2d\n782</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)). But, even were we to consider this argument, we would not find it\npersuasive. The purpose served by Section 32.51, protecting people from identity theft, is distinct\nfrom the purpose served by Section 32.21(e-1), which is to protect the recipient of the forged\nwriting against loss of property or services. Given this fact, it is not illogical or absurd to have\ndifferent punishments to protect these different interests.\n\f                                                                                 Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 26\n\n\n                 2. Legislative history supports holding that the value ladder is\n                    mandatory when raised by the facts.\n\n          Even assuming arguendo that Section 32.21 is ambiguous on this point, the relevant\n\nlegislative history accompanying enactment of Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder supports the\n\nsame conclusion. The Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 1824 indicates that the 2017\n\namendments to Section 32.21 were intended to bring the forgery penalties into conformity\n\nwith the penalties for other property crimes that use a similar value ladder offense-\n\nclassification system. 13 Specifically, the legislative history reflects a particular concern that\n\n\n\n13\n     See Bill Analysis, Senate Research Center, S.B. 1824, April 21, 2017. The Bill Analysis states,\n\n          Last session, the governor signed H.B. 1396, which updated the property crime\n          thresholds to reflect twenty years of inflation. . . . However, the charge of forgery\n          was unintentionally left out of the threshold adjustment. S.B. 1824 corrects this\n          oversight and updates the threshold ladder for forgery crimes related to fake checks,\n          money orders, and other simple transactions to match the penalty ladder for the rest\n          of Texas\u2019 theft offenses.\n\n          S.B. 1824 amends Section 32.21, Penal Code, to bring the offense of forgery in line\n          with the damage amounts for all other property crimes, including the similar crime\n          of theft by check. . . . Current law designates forgery by check, or \u201cfake checks,\u201d to\n          be an automatic state jail felony, along with writings that pretend to be a will, deed,\n          mortgage, or security agreement. Forgery of a will is a far more serious offense\n          than forgery of a check for a small dollar amount. Many forgery charges resulting\n          in a state jail sentence relate to simple check forgery in an amount that would\n          otherwise qualify as misdemeanor under the property threshold structure. Some of\n          these convictions are first-time offenders. Moreover, very similar check-related\n          offenses, trying to cash a hot check or write a bad check for goods and services,\n          were included in the property crime threshold adjustment from last session. S.B.\n          1824 creates consistency with other check-related offenses and keeps non-violent\n          offenders, many of whom are first time offenders, out of Texas state jails.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443077/boykin-v-state/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added). We note here that the provisions in Section 32.21(e-1) were originally\nproposed in Senate Bill 1824. However, the provisions were ultimately added through a floor\namendment to another bill, House Bill 351. See Acts 2017, 85th Leg., ch. 977 (H.B. 351), \u00a7 25,\neff.

Conclusion: The provisions in subsection (e-1) are mandatory\n                  rather than discretionary.\n\n       Accordingly, we uphold this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis in which it\n\nconcluded that the provisions in subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder are not discretionary but\n\nare instead mandatory when raised by the facts. Thus, if the facts of the offense show that\n\nthe defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service,\u201d\n\nsee TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1), the offense-classification provisions in subsection (e-\n\n1) control over those in subsections (d) and (e) in the event of a conflict.\n\n       D.      Subsection (e-1) is a statutory element, rather than a punishment issue.\n\n       We now address the issue presented in Green regarding how subsection (e-1) should\n\noperate in practice. One aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis of this question was a\n\nconsideration of whether subsection (e-1) was intended to operate as a punishment-phase\n\nissue, or whether it instead operates as an element of forgery that must be pled in the\n\nindictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase.

See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 592. 15 We agree.\n\n               1.      Oliva v. State\n\n       In Oliva, this Court examined whether, under Penal Code Section 49.09, entitled\n\n\u201cEnhanced Offenses and Penalties\u201d related to DWI offenses, 16 subsection (a)\u2014the offense\n\nelevation for DWI offenses after a single prior DWI conviction\u2014served as an element of\n\nan offense or a punishment issue.

At the outset of our analysis in\n\nOliva, we examined a number of textual factors that are relevant to such a determination,\n\nincluding: (1) whether the statute had any \u201cexplicit labeling\u201d designating something as an\n\nelement or punishment issue; (2) whether the provision included the phrase, \u201cA person\n\ncommits an offense if,\u201d which is the most \u201cobvious and common method of prescribing\n\nelements of an offense;\u201d (3) whether the statute increased the actual offense level by\n\nproviding that an offense \u201cis\u201d of a particular grade or instead merely provided that an\n\noffense was punishable under some higher category; (4) whether the provision included\n\n\n15\n  Even though this conclusion was reached by the court of appeals in Green, it is only in Lennox\nthat the State has challenged this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 analysis on discretionary review;\nthe State in Green concedes that (e-1) must function as an element. While the State in Lennox\nargues that (e-1) was intended to operate as a punishment issue, it also seems to concede that\nwhenever (e-1) would apply to aggravate the defendant\u2019s offense level beyond the default offense\nlevel, it must function as an element in those cases to comport with due process. However, the\nState views the applicable \u201cdefault\u201d for these purposes as being set forth by the third-degree felony\nprovision in subsection (e), rather than the Class A misdemeanor default under subsection (c).\n16\n  See TEX.

But, due process requires that other\n\ntypes of fact issues that would raise the maximum punishment for an offense must be\n\nsubmitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 530.

The status\n       of an enhancing provision as a prior-conviction provision, on the other hand, is\n       some indication of a punishment issue but is not conclusive. But the inference that\n       a prior-conviction provision is a punishment issue becomes much stronger when it\n       includes \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language, and that inference is further\n       strengthened if it is also true that the provision is contained in an entirely separate\n       section from the section that more obviously prescribes the elements of the offense.\n\nOliva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">548 S.W.3d at 532</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 30\n\n\nlatter type of issue at the punishment phase, because by that point a defendant has a\n\nforfeitable, statutory-only right to a jury determination under Texas law. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (observing that\n\nthe forfeitable nature of the statutory right to a jury trial at the punishment phase in non-\n\ncapital cases \u201cmight complicate trying at the punishment stage an issue to which the\n\nconstitutional right to a jury trial attaches\u201d).

Applying these considerations to the provision at issue in Oliva, we\n\nultimately concluded that, on balance, the \u201cvarious factors suggest[ed] that the legislature\n\nintended that \u00a7 49.09(a) prescribe a punishment issue\u201d\u2014both because it was a prior-\n\nconviction provision that did not implicate Apprendi considerations, and because the\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 31\n\n\noffense would remain a misdemeanor even if the provision applied and so it was not\n\njurisdictional. Id. at 534.\n\n                2.     Application of Oliva Considerations to Section 32.21(e-1)\n\n         We recognize as an initial matter that Section 32.21(e-1) is quite different from the\n\nprovision that was at issue in Oliva. Oliva involved a traditional prior-conviction\n\naggravating provision, whereas the value ladder in Section 32.21(e-1) does not solely\n\noperate as an aggravating provision; rather, it has the ability to either decrease or increase\n\nthe offense level from the Class A misdemeanor default, depending on the value of the\n\nproperty or services at issue. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1)\u2013(7). This feature of\n\nthe statute complicates our analysis somewhat, but we nevertheless find that the factors\n\nfrom Oliva apply persuasively to show that subsection (e-1) constitutes an element of a\n\ndistinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense, rather than a punishment-phase\n\nissue.\n\n                       a.     The statutory text is ambiguous.\n\n         Beginning with the statutory text itself, Section 32.21 contains no explicit language\n\nindicating whether the Legislature intended for subsection (e-1) to operate as an element\n\nor as a punishment issue. Importantly, subsection (e-1) does include the phrase, \u201cif it is\n\nshown on the trial of an offense,\u201d which is a phrase \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with punishment\n\nissues and \u201cseem[s] inherently to indicate something that is in addition to an element of the\n\noffense.\u201d Oliva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">548 S.W.3d at 527</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. And yet, in Oliva we recognized that the inclusion of\n\nthis \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language is not conclusive evidence that something\n\nshould be treated as a punishment issue. That is because in some instances, we have held\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 32\n\n\nthat provisions including this language were elemental for other reasons. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id. at 528</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(observing that \u201c[i]t is not always true that this phrase . . . causes a statute to prescribe a\n\npunishment issue,\u201d and citing TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7 49.09(b)(2), and Benson, 459 S.W.3d at\n\n75-76).\n\n       Several other considerations from Oliva weigh in favor of treating (e-1) as an\n\nelement: (1) subsection (e-1) does not contain the words \u201cpunish\u201d or \u201cpunishable\u201d but\n\ninstead provides that an offense \u201cis\u201d a particular grade of felony or misdemeanor; (2) it is\n\nnot a prior-conviction enhancement provision but instead involves facts surrounding \u201cthe\n\ncircumstances of the offense on trial;\u201d and (3) it is found in the same Penal Code section\n\nas the provision defining the core forgery offense, Section 32.21(b), rather than being\n\ncontained in an entirely separate Penal Code section. See id. at 530, 532. Weighing these\n\nfactors on the whole, we find ambiguity in the statute and will therefore consider\n\nextratextual factors.\n\n                        b.   Based on Apprendi and jurisdictional considerations,\n                             the aggravating portions of the value ladder must be\n                             treated as elements.\n\n       Both the Apprendi/due process and jurisdictional considerations discussed in Oliva\n\nare highly relevant here. First, if we were to treat the provisions in (e-1) as setting forth a\n\npunishment issue, the aggravating portions of the value ladder (i.e., those that would\n\nelevate the offense level above the Class A misdemeanor default), would trigger the\n\nrequirements of Apprendi because the facts at issue\u2014whether the defendant engaged in the\n\nconduct to obtain property or services and the value of any property or services at issue\u2014\n\nare facts that increase the maximum potential punishment for forgery. See TEX. PENAL\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 33\n\n\nCODE \u00a7 32.21(c) (providing that base-level forgery offense is Class A misdemeanor, except\n\nas provided by subsections (d), (e), and (e-1)); (e-1)(4)\u2013(7) (setting forth felony offense\n\nclassifications under the value ladder ranging from state-jail felony to first-degree felony);\n\nsee also Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\n\nany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\n\nmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). This factor weighs\n\nheavily in favor of treating at least the aggravating portions of the value ladder as elements\n\nto protect against possible violations of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury\n\ndetermination of these facts.

PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(4)\u2013(7) (value-ladder provisions setting forth state-jail\n\nthrough first-degree felony offense classifications for any forgery involving property or\n\nservices valued at more than $2,500). Thus, the State could invoke these aggravating\n\nportions of the value ladder at the pleading stage to demonstrate that the offense is a felony\n\nover which the district court has jurisdiction. Under those circumstances, such an allegation\n\nunder (e-1) would constitute a jurisdictional element, which, as we indicated in Oliva, must\n\nbe treated as an element for all purposes.

The question then becomes whether, despite treating\n\nthe aggravating portions of the value ladder as elements, see id. \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(4)\u2013(7), we\n\nshould nevertheless treat the misdemeanor provisions within the value ladder as mere\n\npunishment provisions.\n\n      We decline to adopt such an awkward construction of Section 32.21(e-1) that would\n\nin effect \u201csplit\u201d the value ladder in two, with the felony provisions constituting\n\njurisdictional elements and the misdemeanor provisions constituting punishment issues.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the Legislature would have intended such a cumbersome\n\nresult. In reaching this conclusion, we rely on Holoman, 620 S.W.3d at 145\u201347.\n\n                            i.     Holoman v. State\n\n       In Holoman, when faced with a similar question about the prior-conviction\n\naggravating provision for family-violence assault found in Penal Code Section\n\n22.01(b)(2)(A), we declined to adopt the State\u2019s proposed construction that would have\n\f                                                                               Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 35\n\n\nallowed that provision to operate \u201ceither elementally, or as a punishment provision only,\n\ndepending on the vicissitudes of the particular case.\u201d Id. at 147. 18 Instead, we held that the\n\nprovision must consistently operate only as an element. Id. The State had conceded that\n\nSection 22.01(b)(2)(A) could sometimes operate as a jurisdictional element that must be\n\npled in the indictment and proven at the guilt phase\u2014but if it was not invoked for that\n\npurpose in a particular case, then under those circumstances the State argued that it could\n\ninstead operate as a punishment issue. Id. at 144. 19 We declared the State\u2019s construction to\n\nbe \u201codd and unwieldy,\u201d such that it was unlikely the Legislature would have intended it.\n\nId. at 147. In reaching our decision, we cited Oliva and observed that the neighboring\n\nprovision in Section 22.01(b)(2)(B), which raises assault on a family member to a third-\n\n\n\n18\n   See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 22.01(b)(2)(A) (providing that misdemeanor assault is elevated to a\nthird-degree felony \u201cif it is shown on the trial of the offense that the defendant has been previously\nconvicted of\u201d one of the enumerated family-violence offenses) (emphasis added). Though our\nanalysis in Holoman did not place much emphasis on the \u201cif it is shown on the trial of\u201d language\nin Section 22.02(b)(2)(A), the fact that we ultimately determined that provision to be elemental in\nspite of the inclusion of that phrase provides additional support for our holding here today.\n19\n   The State had charged Holoman with misdemeanor assault, elevated to a third-degree felony\nunder Penal Code Section 22.01(b)(2)(B). Holoman, 620 S.W.3d at 142; see TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n22.01(b)(2)(B) (providing that assault on a family member is elevated to a third-degree felony if\n\u201cthe offense is committed by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impeding the normal\nbreathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person\u2019s throat or\nneck or by blocking the person\u2019s nose or mouth[.]\u201d). But, the jury declined to find that aggravating\nfact at the guilt phase and instead convicted Holoman of the lesser offense of misdemeanor assault.\nHoloman, 620 S.W.3d at 143. At the punishment phase, however, the State sought to enhance\nHoloman\u2019s offense to a third-degree felony by alleging that he had a prior family-violence assault\nconviction under the neighboring provision in Section 22.01(b)(2)(A). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\n22.01(b)(2)(A) (providing that assault on a family member is a third-degree felony if \u201cit is shown\non the trial of the offense that the defendant has been previously convicted of\u201d one of the\nenumerated family-violence offenses). Thus, the precise question presented was whether the State\ncould rely upon the prior-conviction provision in subsection (b)(2)(A) at the punishment phase to\nelevate Holoman\u2019s offense to a third-degree felony after the jury had already rejected the other\naggravating facts alleged under (b)(2)(B) during the guilt phase.\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 36\n\n\ndegree felony if the defendant committed the offense by impeding the victim\u2019s breathing\n\nor blood circulation, was almost certainly \u201ccategorically elemental\u201d because it was part of\n\nthe circumstances of the offense on trial.

We declined\n\nto adopt the State\u2019s \u201clopsided\u201d construction of the statute, wherein one of the aggravating\n\nprovisions in Section 22.01(b)(2) would be elemental in all instances while the other could\n\nsometimes be elemental and sometimes operate as a punishment issue. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> We concluded\n\nthat Section 22.01(b)(2)(A) was \u201can element of an aggravated crime and not, alternatively,\n\na punishment enhancement.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4278815\"><a href=\"/opinion/4501562/oliva-v-state/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       Although Holoman is distinguishable from this case in some key respects, the broad\n\nprinciples underlying that decision nevertheless apply here.

See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(e-1)(1)\u2013(7).\n\n                            ii.

Were we to treat the misdemeanor portions of subsection (e-1) as punishment\n\nprovisions, the practical effect would be to undermine one of the value ladder\u2019s apparent\n\npurposes of reducing the penalties for forgery offenses committed to obtain low-dollar-\n\nvalue goods or services. See n. 13, supra (referencing Bill Analysis stating that the value\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 37\n\n\nladder was enacted, in part, to reduce the penalties for low-dollar-value forgery offenses\n\nand to keep such offenders \u201cout of state jail\u201d). This is because, under that construction, the\n\nState could routinely charge such offenses under the felony type-of-writing provisions in\n\nsubsections (d) and (e), only for those offenses to eventually be reduced to misdemeanors\n\nat the punishment phase through application of the value ladder. But by then, in many\n\ninstances, such defendants would have already spent a significant amount of time in pretrial\n\ncustody\u2014likely exceeding the maximum permissible punishment for misdemeanor\n\nforgery. 20 The court of appeals emphasized this consideration in its analysis of these issues,\n\nhighlighting the example of Green\u2019s case, wherein he spent five months incarcerated before\n\nthe trial court granted his motion to quash. See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 587\u201389. We agree\n\nwith the court of appeals that it is highly unlikely the Legislature would have intended for\n\noffenders who commit forgery to obtain low-dollar-value goods or services to be initially\n\ncharged with felonies, only to have their offenses reduced to misdemeanors at the\n\npunishment phase (and even then, only if they raise an issue under Subsection (e-1) as a\n\ndefensive matter).\n\n              3.     Conclusion: Subsection (e-1)\u2019s value ladder must operate as an\n                     element rather than as a punishment issue.\n\n       In sum, we think it improbable that the Legislature would have intended for\n\nsubsection (e-1) to sometimes operate as a jurisdictional element (i.e., whenever it\n\naggravates a forgery offense above the Class A misdemeanor default level into the felony\n\n\n20\n  See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 12.21\u201312.23 (setting forth misdemeanor punishments ranging from a\nmaximum $500 fine only for Class C misdemeanors, up to confinement for a year and a maximum\n$4,000 fine for a Class A misdemeanor).\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 38\n\n\nrange), and sometimes operate as a defensive punishment issue (i.e., whenever it serves to\n\nreduce the defendant\u2019s offense level). We decline to adopt such an awkward interpretation\n\nof the statute that is unsupported by the statutory text, legislative history, or practical\n\nconsiderations. Accordingly, we reject the State\u2019s position in Lennox that subsection (e-1)\n\nwas intended to operate as a punishment issue. We instead conclude that subsection (e-1)\n\nconstitutes an element of a distinct forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense that may\n\nresult in either an aggravated or reduced offense level as compared to the Class A\n\nmisdemeanor default.\n\n       E.     The court of appeals erred in its application of Apprendi\n              principles.\n\n       In spite of our broad agreement with the court of appeals\u2019 analysis up to this point,\n\nwe part ways with the lower court in its understanding of how due process principles under\n\nApprendi affect the practical operation of Section 32.21. In particular, the court of appeals\n\nheld that after the addition of subsection (e-1) to the statute, due process principles would\n\nrequire the State to plead and prove a new non-statutory element in all forgery cases\n\nbrought under subsections (d) or (e)\u2014that is, the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d for committing the\n\nforgery\u2014because the defendant\u2019s non-property-related purpose was the \u201cenhancing\n\nelement\u201d that would permit prosecution under the aggravated provisions in subsections (d)\n\nand (e). See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 596. We conclude that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to this situation, and we therefore reject its adoption of\n\na non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element that was based on that analysis.\n\f                                                                         Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 39\n\n\n       In Apprendi, the Supreme Court examined a New Jersey \u201chate crime\u201d statute that\n\nauthorized the trial judge, at the punishment phase, to impose an increased range of\n\npunishment for an offense if the judge determined by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nthe defendant committed the offense with the intent to intimidate a person or group of\n\npersons because of their race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or\n\nethnicity. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 468. The New Jersey courts had upheld the statute,\n\nreasoning that such a practice was permissible because the statute set forth a mere\n\n\u201csentencing factor,\u201d rather than an element of a criminal offense. Id. at 471. The Supreme\n\nCourt rejected this reasoning and held that the statute violated due process. Id. at 490. In\n\ndoing so, it set forth the seminal rule that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any\n\nfact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must\n\nbe submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\u2014and this is true regardless\n\nof whether such \u201cfact\u201d is labeled as an element or sentencing factor. Id. at 490 (emphasis\n\nadded). The problem with the hate crime statute, therefore, was that it \u201c\u2018remove[d] from\n\nthe jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a\n\ncriminal defendant is exposed\u2019\u201d by labeling those facts as mere sentencing factors that the\n\njudge could decide and apply at the punishment phase. Id. (quoting Jones v.

Applying that rule requires us to define the pertinent \u201ccrime,\u201d the \u201cprescribed\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 40\n\n\nstatutory maximum\u201d sentence for that crime, and the fact that would \u201cincrease[ ] the\n\npenalty\u201d for that crime beyond the statutory maximum. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       In the context of the forgery statute, our understanding of the structure of Section\n\n32.21 is that it effectively sets forth four distinct forgery \u201ccrimes,\u201d each with a different\n\nstatutory maximum punishment: (1) the base-level Class A misdemeanor offense under\n\nsubsection (b) (a defendant commits an offense if he \u201cforges a writing with intent to defraud\n\nor harm another\u201d); (2 &amp; 3) the state-jail and third-degree felony provisions in subsections\n\n(d) and (e), each of which requires proof of the base-level offense in subsection (b) plus\n\nthe additional fact that the defendant forged a particular type of writing; and, finally, (4)\n\nthe forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services offense in subsection (e-1), which requires\n\nproof of the base-level offense plus facts showing that the defendant \u201cengaged in the\n\nconduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service\u201d and the value of the property\n\nor services at issue, which determines the offense level. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(b), (d),\n\n(e), (e-1). Based on the statutory structure, the State could prosecute a forgery under any\n\nof these discrete subsections by alleging and proving the statutory elements necessary to\n\nprove each offense. An Apprendi problem would arise only if the State later sought to\n\nintroduce some additional \u201cfact\u201d (other than the fact of a prior conviction), to be decided\n\nby the trial judge, that would result in a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum\n\npunishment prescribed by the particular subsection under which the defendant was charged\n\nand convicted. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775896\"><a href=\"/opinion/775896/united-states-v-ramse-thomas/\">274 F.3d 655</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201cThe\n\nconstitutional rule of Apprendi does not apply where the sentence imposed is not greater\n\nthan the prescribed statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.\u201d).\n\f                                                                             Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 41\n\n\n       From the foregoing discussion, the flaws in the court of appeals\u2019 application of\n\nApprendi principles to this situation become readily apparent. The court viewed Section\n\n32.21 as setting forth one single forgery \u201ccrime\u201d for which the base-level range of\n\npunishment could be as low as a Class C misdemeanor under subsection (e-1). It then\n\nfurther reasoned that the felony type-of-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e)\n\nfunctioned as \u201cenhancing elements\u201d to this base-level offense. This reasoning was\n\nerroneous because Section 32.21 contains not one but four distinct forgery offenses, each\n\nwith a different applicable range of punishment for Apprendi purposes. Accordingly,\n\nsubsections (d) and (e) do not function as \u201cenhancing elements\u201d to an offense under\n\nsubsection (e-1)\u2014they are entirely separate offenses. See, e.g., Juarez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1655020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1655020/juarez-v-state/\">198 S.W.3d\n\n790</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (rejecting Apprendi complaint raised under former Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure Article 62.10(b)(3) because the provisions at issue \u201cdescribe[d]\n\nseparate offenses and are not enhancement provisions\u201d).\n\n       Based on this mistaken understanding of the structure of Section 32.21 and the\n\nrequirements of Apprendi, the court of appeals read a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element into\n\nsubsections (d) and (e)\u2014purportedly to satisfy the due process requirement that the State\n\nallege and prove the \u201cenhancing element\u201d that would permit an increased punishment\n\nunder subsections (d) or (e). See Green, 613 S.W.3d at 596. 21 But, even setting aside the\n\n\n\n\n21\n  On this point the court of appeals stated: \u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s purpose in forging the writing [for\nsome reason other than to obtain property or services] is the \u2018core criminal offense \u2018element\u2019\u2019 that\nelevates the offense classification in a prosecution under subsection (d) or (e). Therefore,\nunder Apprendi, the State must prove this enhancing element beyond a reasonable doubt, and . . .\nmust allege this enhancing element in the indictment.\u201d 613 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n\f                                                                        Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 42\n\n\nother problems with the court\u2019s reasoning, we are unaware of any authority that would\n\nsupport applying Apprendi in this manner to impose an additional non-statutory\n\nrequirement for an \u201cenhancing\u201d element. Indeed, such an approach appears to be entirely\n\nnovel. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in its\n\napplication of Apprendi principles to Section 32.21. Accordingly, we reject the court\u2019s\n\nholding requiring the State to allege and prove a non-statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d element for felony\n\nforgery cases brought under Section 32.21(d) and (e). We agree with the State\u2019s position\n\nthat subsections (d) and (e) remain complete and valid offenses that the State may rely\n\nupon in prosecuting a forgery, even after the addition of subsection (e-1), without the need\n\nto read any additional non-statutory requirements into those provisions.\n\nIII.   Summary and Conclusion \u2013 Harmonizing the Competing Offense-\n       Classification Provisions in Section 32.21\n\n       To summarize our understanding of how Section 32.21 should operate in light of\n\nthe Legislature\u2019s 2017 amendments, we set forth the following three conclusions:\n\n       First, by adding subsection (e-1) to Section 32.21, and by making the felony type-\n\nof-writing provisions in subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1),\u201d the\n\nLegislature plainly signaled its intent that, whenever the triggering terms in subsection (e-\n\n1) are satisfied (i.e., the defendant engaged in the forgery \u201cto obtain or attempt to obtain a\n\nproperty or service\u201d), the offense classifications in subsection (e-1) must control over those\n\nin subsections (d) and (e) in the event of a conflict. We understand this statutory structure\n\nto effectively operate as a codification of the in pari materia doctrine. See, e.g., Azeez v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382375\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382375/azeez-v-state/\">248 S.W.3d 182</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (Tex. Crim.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">581 S.W.3d\n\n788</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Crim. App. 2019) (holding that the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s\n\npretrial motion to quash where the indictment showed, on its face, that he was being\n\nprosecuted under the incorrect statutory provision). As a practical matter, this means that\n\nif the State charges a forgery offense under subsections (d) or (e) of Section 32.21, but the\n\nfacts show that the defendant\u2019s offense also falls under the value ladder in subsection (e-1)\n\nand (e-1) would result in a reduced offense classification, then the defendant is entitled to\n\nbe convicted and punished under subsection (e-1). Under those circumstances, he may raise\n\na claim that he is being prosecuted under the wrong statutory subsection as a basis for\n\nhaving his offense reduced under the value ladder. We expressly do not decide at this\n\njuncture whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant may raise such a claim\n\npretrial based on the facts alleged in the indictment, as opposed to only being able to raise\n\nsuch a claim after the facts have been adduced at trial. We similarly do not decide at this\n\ntime what preservation requirements would apply to such a claim that the defendant is\n\nbeing prosecuted under the wrong statutory subsection. The parties did not fully brief these\n\nissues on discretionary review, and we believe these issues are better addressed in the\n\ncourse of resolving the merits of these cases. Accordingly, we leave it to the court of\n\nappeals to address these issues in the first instance on remand, to the extent doing so is\n\nnecessary to resolve the remaining issues before it.\n\n       Second, we have determined that Section 32.21(e-1) was intended to operate as a\n\nstatutory element, rather than as a punishment issue. As we have indicated above, this\n\f                                                                          Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 44\n\n\nmeans that Section 32.21 contains four separate forgery offenses: the base-level Class A\n\nmisdemeanor offense under subsection (b); the state-jail and third-degree felony type-of-\n\nwriting offenses in subsections (d) and (e); and the forgery-to-obtain-property-or-services\n\noffense under subsection (e-1). See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32.21(b), (d), (e), (e-1). Each of\n\nthese subsections sets forth a facially valid forgery offense that the State may rely upon in\n\ncharging a forgery by tracking the statutory elements. Given our analysis of the \u201csubject\n\nto\u201d clause in subsections (d) and (e), if the State has information in its possession indicating\n\nthat a defendant committed forgery to obtain property or services, it would be the better\n\npractice for the State to charge the offense under subsection (e-1). If the State believes such\n\nfacts are not present and it opts to charge a forgery under subsections (d) or (e), then in that\n\nsituation, as we have indicated above, if the defendant believes he is being prosecuted\n\nunder the wrong subsection and is instead entitled to be prosecuted under the value ladder,\n\nhe may raise such a claim in the trial court and/or on appeal, subject to any applicable\n\npreservation requirements.\n\n       Finally, we have rejected the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Apprendi/due process\n\nprinciples require the State to plead and prove the non-statutory element of a defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201cpurpose\u201d in a forgery prosecution under Section 32.21(d) or (e). Contrary to the court of\n\nappeals\u2019 reasoning, Apprendi simply does not apply to Section 32.21 to require that result.\n\nNor does the \u201csubject to\u201d language in subsections (d) and (e) itself require the State to\n\nnegate the applicability of subsection (e-1) in a prosecution under those subsections.\n\nAlthough the language making subsections (d) and (e) \u201c[s]ubject to Subsection (e-1)\u201d\n\neffectively restricts the scope of those subsections, we have in other contexts explained that\n\f                                                                          Green &amp; Lennox \u2013 45\n\n\nthis type of limiting language in a statute generally does not give rise to an obligation on\n\nthe State\u2019s part to negate the limitation, unless it is expressly labeled as an \u201cexception.\u201d See\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(a) (\u201cAn exception to an offense in this code is so labeled by the\n\nphrase: \u2018It is an exception to the application of . . . .\u2019\u201d); Baumgart v.

The Court says that this\n\f                                                            NICHOLSON \u2013 2\n\n\n\n\nstatute does not require the accused to know that the officer\u2019s attempt\nto arrest him is lawful.

See Majority Opinion at 4 (\u201cIf the\nplain language is clear and unambiguous, our analysis ends because the\nLegislature must be understood to mean what it has expressed, and it\nis not for the courts to add or subtract from such a statute.\u201d) (quoting\nNguyen v. State, 359 S.W.3d 636, 642 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)). But then,\neven though the language of the statute at issue in this case is both clear\nand unambiguous, the Court declares it to be both ambiguous and even\nabsurd so that it may then, under this Court\u2019s precedents, declare itself\nto be at liberty to announce a construction of the statute that it prefers. 1\n       In the process, the Court makes several other major mistakes.\nFirst, it overlooks the plain import of a 1993 amendment to the\napplicable statute, declaring that the amendment actually preserves an\n\u201cexception\u201d to the offense. But the Legislature could not have more\n\n\n\n       1  This is the very opposite of a textualist approach to statutory\ninterpretation. The Court says: \u201cThus, given that the added term, \u2018lawfully,\u2019\ndeals with the same subject matter of now-repealed Subsection (b), it is more\nprobable that the Legislature intended for the term to provide the same\nexception to prosecution as now-repealed-Subsection (b).\u201d Majority Opinion at\n7 (emphasis added). It also says: \u201cConstruing \u2018lawfully\u2019 to be the equivalent of\nnow-repealed Subsection (b) is also more consistent with the statute\u2019s\npurpose\u2014which we doubt has changed as a result of the 1993 amendment.\u201d Id.\nat 9 (emphasis added). These statements make clear that the Court\u2019s approach\nis not to apply the clear and unambiguous meaning of the statutory text.\nInstead, it seeks to give effect to what it believes \u201cis more probable that the\nLegislature intended\u201d to say. It does so because it \u201cdoubts\u201d that the \u201cpurpose\u201d\nof the law was what the Legislature actually said. It thus reveals itself to be\nmore concerned with what it thinks the Legislature was hoping to achieve than\nwhat the Legislature actually did achieve.\n\f                                                       NICHOLSON \u2013 3\n\n\n\n\nclearly eliminated the former exception in favor of adding to the culpable\nmental state in the definition of the offense itself. The Court then\ndeclares the plain meaning of the current iteration of the statute to lead\nto a result that is absurd merely because that result seems unreflective\nof what it perceives to be the legislative objective\u2014which objective the\nCourt gleans from sources wholly apart from the language of the statute\nitself. I cannot follow this approach.\n      For the reasons I explain in the ensuing pages, however, I\nnevertheless agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate disposition of the case. I\ntherefore concur in the result.\n          I. FIRST, WHY ARE WE REACHING THIS QUESTION?\n      As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to examine why the Court\neven reaches the issue it does today\u2014namely, whether Section 38.04(a)\nalso requires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful\u2014when that\nissue seems to have no impact on the court of appeals\u2019 ultimate\ndisposition of the case. The Court itself seems never to explain.\n      The court of appeals reversed Appellant\u2019s conviction and\nremanded the case for new trial. The Court today, in addressing\nAppellant\u2019s petition for discretionary review, affirms that disposition.\nMajority Opinion at 10\u201311. But the basis for the court of appeals\u2019\nreversal had nothing to do with the issue that the Court actually\naddresses: whether Section 38.04(a) of the Texas Penal Code requires\nthe State to prove that the accused knew (i.e., was aware) that the peace\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 38.04(a),\n6.03(b). Instead, the court of appeals reversed Appellant\u2019s conviction\nbased upon the fact that the jury charge failed to instruct the jury that\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 4\n\n\n\n\nit must find that Appellant knew (i.e., was aware) that the peace officer\nwas attempting to arrest him at the time he fled. Nicholson v. State, 594\nS.W.3d 480, 482 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2019). In fact, the State conceded this\nerror on appeal. Id. But if the jury charge was fatally deficient in the\nrespect addressed by the court of appeals, then the conviction must be\nreversed regardless of whether Appellant must also have been aware\nthat the arrest was unlawful. So why does the Court find it necessary to\naddress the latter issue in an Appellant\u2019s petition for discretionary\nreview when the Appellant prevailed in the court of appeals?\n         The reason that the question\u2014whether Section 38.04(a) also\nrequires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful\u2014is relevant is\nthat Appellant also sought a greater form of relief than just a retrial due\nto jury charge error. He also contended that the evidence was legally\ninsufficient to prove that he was aware that the peace officer\u2019s attempt\nto arrest him was lawful. And, even when a court of appeals finds trial\nerror in a case\u2014such as jury charge error\u2014it is still obligated to address\na legal sufficiency argument, since a successful claim of legal\ninsufficiency of the evidence would result in a greater form of relief\u2014an\nacquittal. Benavidez v. State, 323 S.W.3d 179, 182 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2010).\n         The court of appeals resolved the legal sufficiency issue, however,\nwithout ever even authoritatively construing the knowledge-of-\nlawfulness aspect of the statute. 2 Instead, it simply decided that the\nevidence was legally sufficient to prove Appellant\u2019s knowledge of the\n\n\n         2 See Nicholson, 594 S.W.3d at 482 (\u201c[W]e need not address [Appellant\u2019s]\n\nthird issue pertaining to his knowledge of the lawfulness of his arrest[.]\u201d).\n\f                                                              NICHOLSON \u2013 5\n\n\n\n\nlawfulness, based only on an assumption that such knowledge was a\nnecessary element of the State\u2019s case. Id. at 488. It is this sufficiency-of-\nthe-evidence holding (based only on an assumption of the statute\u2019s\nrequirements) that Appellant challenges now, in this Court\u2014in his\nsecond ground for discretionary review, which we granted. 3 I, too, would\nresolve the case on that same basis, finding the evidence to be legally\nsufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction.\n       But Appellant\u2019s first ground for review, which we also granted, is\nthe only ground that the Court actually addresses today. There,\nAppellant asks us to resolve whether the statute indeed requires proof\nof knowledge that the arrest was lawful. But remember: The court of\nappeals found it unnecessary to resolve that issue\u2014and it did not do so.\nId. at 485\u221288. Nor should this Court address it today in the first\ninstance! 4\n\n\n\n\n       3 This Court granted discretionary review in this case on the following\n\ntwo grounds:\n\n           1. Whether the plain language of the evading-arrest statute\n              requires proof of knowledge that the attempted arrest or\n              detention is lawful.; and\n\n           2. Whether it matters in this case; whether the evidence is\n              legally insufficient to show that Nicholson knew he was\n              being lawfully detained.\n\n       4 See Ex parte Sanders, 663 S.W.3d 197, 202 (Tex. Crim. App. 2022) (\u201cIt\n\nis . . . well-established that \u2018[i]n our discretionary review capacity we review\n\u201cdecisions\u201d of the courts of appeals.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Stringer v. State, 241 S.W.3d 52,\n59 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007), which in turn quoted Lee v. State, 791 S.W.2d 141,\n142 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)); see also TEX. R. APP. P. 66.1 (\u201cThe Court of\nCriminal Appeals may review a court of appeals\u2019 decision in a criminal case on\n\f                                                           NICHOLSON \u2013 6\n\n\n\n\n       Instead, if anything, we should only address whether the court of\nappeals was correct that the evidence was sufficient to prove such an\nelement even if such proof was required. Only if we were to conclude\nthat that the court of appeals erred in this respect would it become\nnecessary for us to then address whether proof of knowledge of\nlawfulness is required\u2014and even then, we should only resolve that\nquestion after first remanding the cause to the court of appeals to\naddress and resolve the merits of that issue in the first instance, since\nwe ordinarily review only decisions that have already been made by the\ncourts of appeals. E.g., Osorio-Lopez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 750, 757 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2022) (\u201cWe decline to address these issues in the first\ninstance, however, because this Court reviews only decisions of the\ncourts of appeal unless \u2018the proper resolution of the remaining issue is\nclear . . .,\u2019 Davison v. State, 405 S.W.3d 682, 691\u201392 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2013), which is not the case here.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n       However, because the Court today unfortunately addresses that\nissue\u2014and only that issue\u2014I will address it too, if only because I believe\nthe Court resolves it so very incorrectly. And I believe that, in resolving\nthe question the way it does, the Court has misapplied fundamental\nstatutory-construction tenets. Still, and only because I agree with the\ncourt of appeals that the evidence was sufficient to prove Appellant\u2019s\nknowledge of the lawfulness of this arrest, I concur in the Court\u2019s\ndisposition.\n\n\n\n\nits own initiative under Rule 67 or on the petition of a party under Rule 68.\u201d)\n(emphasis added).\n\f                                                           NICHOLSON \u2013 7\n\n\n\n\n                    II. THE STATUTE SPEAKS PLAINLY\n       Turning to the merits of the question of whether the statute\nrequires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful, I must say that\nI could not find the statute any plainer. As it currently reads, Section\n38.04(a) requires proof that (in relevant part): \u201cA person . . .\nintentionally flees from a person he knows is a peace officer . . .\nattempting lawfully to arrest . . . him.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(a). This\nprovision contains one obvious nature-of-conduct element: flight. That\nnature-of-conduct element carries its own culpable mental state:\n\u201cintentionally.\u201d But flight alone hardly constitutes criminal conduct all\non its own, even when perpetrated intentionally. Thus, the true crux of\nthe statute is only fully revealed in the context of all of its accompanying\ncircumstances, which take up the remainder of the statute: that the\nflight is \u201cfrom a person [who] is a peace officer . . . attempting lawfully\nto arrest . . . him.\u201d\n       When a criminal offense essentially turns, as this one does, on the\ncircumstances under which conduct occurs, it becomes imperative to\nassign a culpable mental state to at least some of those circumstances 5\u2014\neither knowledge, recklessness, or negligence (since \u201cintent\u201d does not\n\n\n\n\n       5 See McQueen v. State, 781 S.W.2d 600, 604 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989)\n\n(\u201c[S]ome form of culpability must apply to those \u2018conduct elements\u2019 which make\nthe overall conduct criminal.\u201d); State v. Ross, 573 S.W.3d 817, 824 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2019) (endorsing and applying McQueen\u2019s observation that, \u201cwhere\notherwise innocent conduct becomes criminal because of the circumstances\nunder which it is done, a culpable mental state is required as to those\nsurrounding circumstances\u201d (quoting McQueen, 781 S.W.2d at 603)).\n\f                                                            NICHOLSON \u2013 8\n\n\n\n\ntypically apply to circumstances that surround conduct). 6 TEX. PENAL\nCODE \u00a7 6.02(b). Here, the statute itself assigns the mental state of\n\u201cknowing\u201d: it says \u201che knows\u201d\u2014that is to say, he must be \u201caware\u201d\u2014\u201cthat\nthe circumstances exist.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 38.04(a), 6.03(b). The\nquestion thus devolves into this: How far down the statutory description\nof the circumstances surrounding the flight does the assigned culpable\nmental state of knowledge run? 7 In my view, Section 38.04(a) plainly\nanswers that question: The culpable mental state runs all the way to the\nend of the sentence.\n       This is true, not only, as the Court acknowledges, because there\nis no punctuation to suggest otherwise. Majority Opinion at 6. 8 Apart\nfrom, and in addition to, the lack of qualifying punctuation, this is\nsimply the way that modifiers work. It is beyond cavil that the actor\nmust \u201cknow\u201d that the person from whom he is fleeing \u201cis a peace\nofficer[.]\u201d Otherwise, \u201cknowing\u201d would have no application at all. The\nphrase \u201cattempting to arrest[,]\u201d in turn, modifies \u201cpeace officer\u201d: It is\n\n\n       6 See Robinson v. State, 466 S.W.3d 166 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015)\n(observing that \u201cthe statutory definition of \u2018intent\u2019 [in Section 6.03(a) of the\nPenal Code] contains no provision for circumstances surrounding conduct,\nunlike the definitions [in Sections 6.03(b) and (c)] of knowledge and\nrecklessness\u201d).\n\n       7 See Robinson, 466 S.W.3d at 171 (referring to \u201cthe common issue of\n\ndeciphering a statute\u2019s language to answer the question of how far down the\nsentence the stated culpable mental state runs\u201d); Ross, 573 S.W.3d at 824\n(same).\n\n       8 The Court concedes that \u201c[o]ne reading of the statute suggests that the\n\nword \u2018knows\u2019 distributes evenly to the entire subordinate remainder of the\nsentence. Supportive of this reading is the fact that there is no punctuation\u2014\ncommas, parenthesis, or other grammatical tools.\u201d Majority Opinion at 6.\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 9\n\n\n\n\nconduct that the peace officer must be undertaking at the time of the\nflight for an offense to occur. And indeed, the Court has already decided\nthat the accused must also know that the peace officer is \u201cattempting . .\n. to arrest him\u201d to be culpable under the statute. See Jackson v. State,\n718 S.W.2d 724, 726 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (finding this to be the only\nreading of the pre-1993 amendment that is \u201cconsistent with the\ngrammatical structure of the statute\u201d).\n       The word \u201clawfully,\u201d in turn, appears within, and directly\nmodifies, the phrase \u201cattempting . . . to arrest[.]\u201d 9 In fact, it is found\nembedded exactly between the words \u201cattempting\u201d and \u201carrest.\u201d There\nis nothing in the structure of the sentence to suggest that this imbedded\nsub-modifier of the modifier of \u201cpeace officer\u201d should not also be included\nas an essential part of what the actor must \u201cknow\u201d about the\ncircumstances surrounding his conduct before he may be liable for an\noffense under the statute.\n       Are we to believe that the knowledge requirement imposes itself\nboth upon the words \u201cattempting\u201d and \u201carrest\u201d but not on the word that\nappears exactly in between them? No, that is what I believe would be\nabsurd! There is no textual ambiguity! Indeed, the Court today does not\n\n\n       9 It could not be any plainer that the adverb \u201clawfully\u201d directly modifies\n\nthe entire phrase within which it falls: \u201cattempting . . . to arrest.\u201d And since\n\u201cattempting . . . to arrest\u201d plainly describes what the \u201cpeace officer\u201d must be\ndoing\u2014so plainly that we said in Jackson that the only permissible\nconstruction of the statute was to require knowledge of that circumstance\u2014\nthen the only way to read \u201clawfully,\u201d which categorically modifies \u201cattempting\nto arrest,\u201d is as an inextricable aspect of the circumstances surrounding\nconduct of which the actor must be \u201caware\u201d before he may be found guilty under\nthe statute. It is an integral part of the entire adjectival phrase that modifies\nthe noun \u201cpeace officer\u201d: \u201cattempting lawfully to arrest\u201d the actor.\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 10\n\n\n\n\nreally suggest otherwise.\n       The Court nevertheless declares the statute to be ambiguous in\nthis regard, but only because \u201ca number of\u201d courts of appeals have\nbalked at the consequences of this plain reading of the statute. Majority\nOpinion at 6, 6 n.16 (although identifying only one such court of appeals\nopinion). 10 Perhaps the Court also has determined\u2014all on its own\u2014that\nthe statute is ambiguous. But the Court fails to demonstrate any\nambiguity at all that arises from the text.\n            III. RESOLVING THE (NON-EXISTENT) AMBIGUITY\n       The Court begins its extratextual analysis, in light of the alleged\nambiguity it perceives in the text, with a look at the history of the\nstatute \u201cfor further indicators of legislative intent.\u201d Majority Opinion at\n7. 11 The only aspect of the statute\u2019s history that the Court finds\n\n       10 For its part, the court of appeals identified a number of other court of\n\nappeals opinions that have declined to hold that the State must prove that an\naccused knew the peace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful. Nicholson,\n594 S.W.3d at 484\u221285. But, as the court of appeals also observed, each of those\nopinions relied upon precedents from this Court that preceded the 1993\namendment to Section 38.04, which added the requirement that the peace\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest be \u201clawful\u201d as an element of the offense. Id.; Acts\n1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 900, \u00a7 1.01, p. 3667, eff. Sept. 1, 1994. None of the opinions\naddressed the fact that the 1993 amendment added the word \u201clawfully\u201d to\nSection 38.04(a) as an element of the offense, much less entertained an\nargument whether the plain language of the provision, as so amended, now\nrequires proof that the accused knew the peace officer\u2019s attempted arrest was\nlawful. Id. at 484.\n\n       11 Of course, to the extent that a statute\u2019s history provides context for\n\nconstruing its text, we can consult it regardless of whether the statutory text\nis ambiguous. See Ex parte Moon, 667 S.W.3d 796, 803 (Tex. Crim. App. 2023):\n\n       The starting point for determining statutory meaning is to\n       examine both the literal text of the statute and its context; and\n       part of the statutory context includes the history of the statute\n\f                                                            NICHOLSON \u2013 11\n\n\n\n\nsignificant is the 1993 amendment to Section 38.04. This amendment\ndeleted the former Subsection (b) of the statute, which had made the fact\nthat the attempted arrest was \u201cunlawful\u201d an explicit exception to the\noffense. As an exception, the fact that the arrest was not unlawful was\nrequired, under former Subsection (b), to be pled and proven by the State\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(b). In place of this\nexplicit exception, the Legislature amended Section 38.04(a) to add the\nword \u201clawfully\u201d among the elements of the offense itself. Acts 1993, 73rd\nLeg., ch. 900, \u00a7 1.01, p. 3667, eff. Sept. 1, 1994.\n       Now the Court says that this amendment was nothing more than\na bit of legislative housekeeping; that it was not meant to change the\nstatutory status quo. The Court goes so far as to declare it \u201cprobable that\nthe Legislature intended for the term [\u201clawfully\u201d] to provide the same\nexception to prosecution as now-repealed-subsection (b).\u201d Majority\nOpinion at 7 (emphasis added). In fact, it is not remotely possible, not to\nmention \u201cprobable,\u201d that by deleting the express exception in former\n\n\n       in question. Timmins v. State, 601 S.W.3d 345, 348, 354 & n.50\n       (Tex. Crim. App. 2020) (citing Antonin Scalia & Bryan Garner,\n       READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 256 (2012)\n       (\u201cdefining \u2018statutory history\u2019 as \u2018the statutes repealed or\n       amended by the statute under consideration\u2019 and explaining\n       that statutory history \u2018form[s] part of the context of [a]\n       statute\u2019\u201d)).\n\n        In any event, as I have said before, we should never be consulting\nextratextual content for evidence of untethered legislative intent; we should\nsimply be striving to find the most accurate construction of the text itself. See\nEx parte Kibler, 664 S.W.3d 220, 233\u221234 (Tex. Crim. App. 2022) (Yeary, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cWe should not be seeking to effectuate anyone\u2019s intent or purpose\nunless that simply means construing and giving meaning to the words that are\nthe literal text of the statute in question. * * * We should stop saying that our\npurpose is to effectuate legislative intent.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                                            NICHOLSON \u2013 12\n\n\n\n\nSection 38.04(b), the Legislature effectuated \u201conly a stylistic or non-\nsubstantive change.\u201d Id. No, quite the contrary.\n       Section 2.02(a) of the Penal Code provides: \u201cAn exception to an\noffense in this code is so labeled by the phrase: \u2018It is an exception to the\napplication of . . . .\u2019\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(a). Given this plain\nlanguage, it cannot reasonably be said that by removing the explicit\nlanguage meant to delineate an exception under Section 38.04, the\nmanifest legislative purpose was somehow to preserve that same\nexception. This anomaly is all the more glaring considering what this\nCourt has observed regarding the dictates of Section 2.02(a).\n       In Baumgart v. State, 512 S.W.3d 335 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017), the\nCourt said the following in discussing the requirement of the use of the\nphrase, \u201cIt is an exception to the application of . . .\u201d:\n       [T]here are times when the legislature has mandated strict\n       compliance with a statutory provision. This is one of those\n       times. In saying that an exception is \u201clabeled\u201d with a\n       particular phrase, and in placing that particular phrase in\n       quotation marks, the legislature has decreed that an\n       exception exists only when that exact phrase is used. Even\n       the ellipsis within the quoted phrase contributes to the idea\n       that, though the content of exceptions may vary, they are\n       always introduced with the same phrase.\n\nId. at 344 (emphasis added). In view of this observation, it cannot\nreasonably be thought that by deleting \u201cthat exact phrase\u201d from Section\n38.04 altogether, the Legislature can be said to have nevertheless\nmaintained the exception within the statute.\n       Instead, the Legislature, explicitly, made it an element of the\noffense that the peace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest the actor must be a\n\u201clawful\u201d one. That is no mere \u201cstylistic\u201d or \u201cnon-substantive\u201d change. The\n\f                                                        NICHOLSON \u2013 13\n\n\n\n\nonly remaining question is whether the statute, as substantively\namended, also requires the State to prove that the actor is aware that\nthe attempted arrest is lawful. For the reasons already developed ante,\nI believe that Section 38.04(a) of the statute\u2014as it currently reads\u2014\nplainly does. And to the extent that the 1993 amendment eliminated the\nunlawfulness exception from the statute, it does not affect that\nconclusion\u2014at all. The Court errs to think otherwise.\n         IV. THE STATUTE\u2019S PLAIN MEANING IS NOT ABSURD\n      The Court also declares that to adopt what I take to be the plain\nmeaning \u201cleads to absurd results.\u201d Majority Opinion at 8. The Court says\nthe question of the lawfulness of the arrest is \u201cmore appropriately\nhandled by a trial court[.]\u201d Id. at 9. Better to continue to treat the issue\nof lawfulness as an exception, notwithstanding the 1993 amendment,\nthe Court apparently believes. Id. But there are several problems with\nthis approach.\n      First and foremost, it is a distortion of the \u201cabsurdity\u201d exception\nto the primacy of plain meaning in statutory construction. That the\nCourt can think of an interpretation of the statute that would be more\n\u201cappropriate\u201d does not grant the Court leave to ignore plain meaning.\n\u201cThe oddity or anomaly of certain consequences may be a perfectly valid\nreason for choosing one textually permissible interpretation over\nanother,\u201d the late Justice Scalia and Professor Garner have observed,\nbut in the face of statutory text the consequences of which are plain, \u201cit\nis no basis for disregarding or changing the text.\u201d Antonin Scalia &\nBryan Garner, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 237\n(2012). Applying the absurdity exception to distort plain meaning, as the\n\f                                                          NICHOLSON \u2013 14\n\n\n\n\nCourt does today, runs counter to the principle that \u201c[t]he doctrine does\nnot include substantive errors arising from a drafter\u2019s failure to\nappreciate the effect of certain provisions.\u201d Id. at 238. Otherwise, the\nabsurdity exception lends itself to \u201cthe charge that it is an application\nnot of textualism but of purposivism\u2014seeking to give the text not the\nmeaning that it objectively conveys but the meaning that was in the\nmind of the drafter.\u201d Id.\n       I have elsewhere registered my profound disapproval of this\n\u201ceffectuate-the-legislative-intent\u201d brand of statutory construction. Ex\nparte Kibler, 664 S.W.3d 220, 233\u221234 (Tex. Crim. App. 2022) (Yeary, J.,\nconcurring). Instead, I agree with the assertion that the absurdity\nexception to the rule that plain meaning should prevail should never be\nrelied upon \u201cto revise purposeful dispositions that, in light of other\nprovisions of the applicable code, make little if any sense.\u201d Scalia &\nGarner, at 239. But that is what the Court does today.\n       In any event, the Court today also greatly exaggerates the\nanomaly of forcing the State to prove that the accused was aware of the\nlawfulness of the peace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him. 12 Under the\n\n       12 The Court at one point says that \u201cwhether an arrest or detention is\n\nlawful or unlawful has resulted in casebooks of technical and fact-intensive\njurisprudence.\u201d Majority Opinion at 9. In at least one other context of which I\nam aware, however, this Court has not thought it absurd to require the State\neven to show that a defendant knew that his own conduct facilitated\ncriminality. See Delay v. State, 465 S.W.3d 232, 246\u221247 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)\n(\u201cWe think the Legislature must surely have intended that, to commit or\nconspire to commit money laundering, the actor must be aware of the fact that\nthe transaction involves the proceeds of criminal activity. Otherwise, the\nstatute would attach a mens rea to nothing more than conduct\u2014conducting,\nsupervising, or facilitating a transaction\u2014that is not intrinsically\nblameworthy.\u201d). Surely it is the case that whether conduct necessarily includes\ncriminality has also \u201cresulted in casebooks of technical and fact intensive\n\f                                                          NICHOLSON \u2013 15\n\n\n\n\nformer exception embodied in Section 38.04(b) prior to the 1993\namendment, the State was already required to negate, both in pleading\nand in proof, \u201cthat the attempted arrest is unlawful[.]\u201d See former TEX.\nPENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(b) prior to amendment by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch.\n900, \u00a7 1.01, p. 3667, eff. Sept. 1, 1994; TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(b). 13 Proof\nin accordance with this former requirement would no doubt often involve\nthe development of the circumstances of the arrest itself. Those\ncircumstances will at least more often than not, I believe, serve just as\nwell to establish the answer to whether the accused was aware that the\npeace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was patently lawful. Indeed, the\nfacts of this case provide a ready example.\n  V. THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO PROVE KNOWLEDGE\n       By the time the police officer in this case attempted to arrest\nAppellant, he (Appellant) had committed several offenses within the\nofficer\u2019s presence, including littering and failure to present a valid\ndriver\u2019s license upon request. Nicholson, 594 S.W.3d at 487. Moreover,\nAppellant had \u201cactive felony warrants\u201d out for his arrest. Id. Even before\nhe attempted to flee the scene, Appellant\u2019s conduct showed a will to\nresist the officer\u2019s efforts to question him and detain him at the scene\nuntil backup units could arrive. Id. at 487\u201388. From these facts a jury\n\n\njurisprudence.\u201d So, I do not understand why the Court finds it absurd today,\nin this circumstance, that the statute should plainly require the State to show\nthat a defendant knew that an officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful.\n\n       13 Section 2.02(b) provides: \u201cThe prosecuting attorney must negate the\n\nexistence of an exception in the accusation charging commission of the offense\nand prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant or defendant\u2019s conduct\ndoes not fall within the exception.\u201d\n\f                                                          NICHOLSON \u2013 16\n\n\n\n\nmight rationally\u2014indeed, even readily\u2014have inferred not just that the\nattempted arrest was lawful, but that Appellant was aware that he was\nsubject to lawful arrest. I agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nthe evidence was legally sufficient to establish this fact to a level of\nconfidence beyond a reasonable doubt. 14\n       That being the case, then, of course it does not matter whether\nSection 38.04(a) requires proof of that fact; Appellant was not entitled\nto an acquittal even if it does. And the court of appeals did not err to\ndecline to ultimately resolve that question, since it could finally dispose\nof the legal sufficiency issue without doing so. On this basis, I would\nreject Appellant\u2019s second ground for review, and I would accordingly\ndismiss Appellant\u2019s first ground for review as moot.\n                             VI. CONCLUSION\n       The Court ultimately disposes of the case today by affirming the\ncourt of appeals\u2019 uncontested reversal based on jury charge error\u2014\nnamely, the failure of the charge to require the jury to find Appellant\nwas aware that the officer was attempting to arrest him at the time of\nthe offense. Majority Opinion at 11. With this much, I agree. But the\nCourt then remands the case to the trial court for a new trial based upon\nthis manifest trial error that the Court never even addresses on the\n\n\n       14 Chief Justice Gray filed a dissenting opinion in which he argued that\n\nSection 38.04(a) does indeed require proof that Appellant was aware that the\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful. Nicholson, 594 S.W.3d at 492. But\nhe believed the evidence was insufficient to prove this element of the offense,\nand he would have acquitted Appellant on that basis. Id. Interestingly, he\nneither explained in what way he thought the evidence was lacking in that\nregard, nor did he even attempt to explicitly refute the majority\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 17\n\n\n\n\nmerits in its opinion. 15\n       It is also a mystery to me exactly why the Court even takes up the\nquestion of whether the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury should also have\ninstructed the jury that it must find Appellant was aware that the\nattempted arrest was also lawful as a predicate to conviction, unless the\nCourt simply desires to inform the lower court of its views on that\nissue. 16 The court of appeals did not find it necessary to resolve that\nissue. And its failure to do so cannot have been an error so long as it was\ncorrect to hold that the evidence was legally sufficient, in any event, to\nprove that fact\u2014an issue the Court today never even acknowledges,\nmuch less addresses.\n       In my view, it is appropriate for this Court to affirm the judgment\nof the court of appeals remanding for trial error. I believe that is the case\nbecause I agree with the court of appeals that the evidence would prove\nknowledge of the lawfulness of the attempted arrest, even assuming\n(without deciding) that proof of that fact is necessary under a plain\nreading of Section 38.04(a). Acquittal is not called for, but reversal for\ntrial error, which the court of appeals has already done, is. I therefore\nconcur in the result the Court announces today. But I cannot join its\nopinion.\n\n\n       15 Of course, this Court, at least in its capacity as a discretionary review\n\ncourt, should not purport to remand the case for a new trial. By affirming the\njudgment of the court of appeals, we leave standing that court\u2019s disposition,\nwhich is where the order to remand occurred. We need not and should not order\nthe remand ourselves.\n\n       16 But this is anomalous since Texas courts are not empowered to give\n\nadvisory opinions. Petetan v.

PENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(a) (emphasis added). The Court says that this\n\f                                                            NICHOLSON \u2013 2\n\n\n\n\nstatute does not require the accused to know that the officer\u2019s attempt\nto arrest him is lawful. I strongly disagree.\n       The Court readily acknowledges the primacy of plain language in\nthe process of construing statutes. See Majority Opinion at 4 (\u201cIf the\nplain language is clear and unambiguous, our analysis ends because the\nLegislature must be understood to mean what it has expressed, and it\nis not for the courts to add or subtract from such a statute.\u201d) (quoting\nNguyen v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2947110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2947110/tha-dang-nguyen-v-state/\">359 S.W.3d 636</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)). But then,\neven though the language of the statute at issue in this case is both clear\nand unambiguous, the Court declares it to be both ambiguous and even\nabsurd so that it may then, under this Court\u2019s precedents, declare itself\nto be at liberty to announce a construction of the statute that it prefers. 1\n       In the process, the Court makes several other major mistakes.\nFirst, it overlooks the plain import of a 1993 amendment to the\napplicable statute, declaring that the amendment actually preserves an\n\u201cexception\u201d to the offense. But the Legislature could not have more\n\n\n\n       1  This is the very opposite of a textualist approach to statutory\ninterpretation. The Court says: \u201cThus, given that the added term, \u2018lawfully,\u2019\ndeals with the same subject matter of now-repealed Subsection (b), it is more\nprobable that the Legislature intended for the term to provide the same\nexception to prosecution as now-repealed-Subsection (b).\u201d Majority Opinion at\n7 (emphasis added). It also says: \u201cConstruing \u2018lawfully\u2019 to be the equivalent of\nnow-repealed Subsection (b) is also more consistent with the statute\u2019s\npurpose\u2014which we doubt has changed as a result of the 1993 amendment.\u201d Id.\nat 9 (emphasis added). These statements make clear that the Court\u2019s approach\nis not to apply the clear and unambiguous meaning of the statutory text.\nInstead, it seeks to give effect to what it believes \u201cis more probable that the\nLegislature intended\u201d to say. It does so because it \u201cdoubts\u201d that the \u201cpurpose\u201d\nof the law was what the Legislature actually said. It thus reveals itself to be\nmore concerned with what it thinks the Legislature was hoping to achieve than\nwhat the Legislature actually did achieve.\n\f                                                       NICHOLSON \u2013 3\n\n\n\n\nclearly eliminated the former exception in favor of adding to the culpable\nmental state in the definition of the offense itself. The Court then\ndeclares the plain meaning of the current iteration of the statute to lead\nto a result that is absurd merely because that result seems unreflective\nof what it perceives to be the legislative objective\u2014which objective the\nCourt gleans from sources wholly apart from the language of the statute\nitself. I cannot follow this approach.\n      For the reasons I explain in the ensuing pages, however, I\nnevertheless agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate disposition of the case. I\ntherefore concur in the result.\n          I. FIRST, WHY ARE WE REACHING THIS QUESTION?\n      As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to examine why the Court\neven reaches the issue it does today\u2014namely, whether Section 38.04(a)\nalso requires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful\u2014when that\nissue seems to have no impact on the court of appeals\u2019 ultimate\ndisposition of the case. The Court itself seems never to explain.\n      The court of appeals reversed Appellant\u2019s conviction and\nremanded the case for new trial. The Court today, in addressing\nAppellant\u2019s petition for discretionary review, affirms that disposition.\nMajority Opinion at 10\u201311. But the basis for the court of appeals\u2019\nreversal had nothing to do with the issue that the Court actually\naddresses: whether Section 38.04(a) of the Texas Penal Code requires\nthe State to prove that the accused knew (i.e., was aware) that the peace\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 38.04(a),\n6.03(b). Instead, the court of appeals reversed Appellant\u2019s conviction\nbased upon the fact that the jury charge failed to instruct the jury that\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 4\n\n\n\n\nit must find that Appellant knew (i.e., was aware) that the peace officer\nwas attempting to arrest him at the time he fled. Nicholson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">594\nS.W.3d 480</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2019). In fact, the State conceded this\nerror on appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> But if the jury charge was fatally deficient in the\nrespect addressed by the court of appeals, then the conviction must be\nreversed regardless of whether Appellant must also have been aware\nthat the arrest was unlawful. So why does the Court find it necessary to\naddress the latter issue in an Appellant\u2019s petition for discretionary\nreview when the Appellant prevailed in the court of appeals?\n         The reason that the question\u2014whether Section 38.04(a) also\nrequires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful\u2014is relevant is\nthat Appellant also sought a greater form of relief than just a retrial due\nto jury charge error. He also contended that the evidence was legally\ninsufficient to prove that he was aware that the peace officer\u2019s attempt\nto arrest him was lawful. And, even when a court of appeals finds trial\nerror in a case\u2014such as jury charge error\u2014it is still obligated to address\na legal sufficiency argument, since a successful claim of legal\ninsufficiency of the evidence would result in a greater form of relief\u2014an\nacquittal.

THE STATUTE SPEAKS PLAINLY\n       Turning to the merits of the question of whether the statute\nrequires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful, I must say that\nI could not find the statute any plainer. As it currently reads, Section\n38.04(a) requires proof that (in relevant part): \u201cA person . . .\nintentionally flees from a person he knows is a peace officer . . .\nattempting lawfully to arrest . . . him.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(a). This\nprovision contains one obvious nature-of-conduct element: flight. That\nnature-of-conduct element carries its own culpable mental state:\n\u201cintentionally.\u201d But flight alone hardly constitutes criminal conduct all\non its own, even when perpetrated intentionally. Thus, the true crux of\nthe statute is only fully revealed in the context of all of its accompanying\ncircumstances, which take up the remainder of the statute: that the\nflight is \u201cfrom a person [who] is a peace officer . . . attempting lawfully\nto arrest . . . him.\u201d\n       When a criminal offense essentially turns, as this one does, on the\ncircumstances under which conduct occurs, it becomes imperative to\nassign a culpable mental state to at least some of those circumstances 5\u2014\neither knowledge, recklessness, or negligence (since \u201cintent\u201d does not\n\n\n\n\n       5 See McQueen v.

Nicholson,\n594 S.W.3d at 484\u221285. But, as the court of appeals also observed, each of those\nopinions relied upon precedents from this Court that preceded the 1993\namendment to Section 38.04, which added the requirement that the peace\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest be \u201clawful\u201d as an element of the offense. Id.; Acts\n1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 900, \u00a7 1.01, p. 3667, eff. Sept. 1, 1994. None of the opinions\naddressed the fact that the 1993 amendment added the word \u201clawfully\u201d to\nSection 38.04(a) as an element of the offense, much less entertained an\nargument whether the plain language of the provision, as so amended, now\nrequires proof that the accused knew the peace officer\u2019s attempted arrest was\nlawful. Id. at 484.\n\n       11 Of course, to the extent that a statute\u2019s history provides context for\n\nconstruing its text, we can consult it regardless of whether the statutory text\nis ambiguous.

As an exception, the fact that the arrest was not unlawful was\nrequired, under former Subsection (b), to be pled and proven by the State\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(b).

In view of this observation, it cannot\nreasonably be thought that by deleting \u201cthat exact phrase\u201d from Section\n38.04 altogether, the Legislature can be said to have nevertheless\nmaintained the exception within the statute.\n       Instead, the Legislature, explicitly, made it an element of the\noffense that the peace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest the actor must be a\n\u201clawful\u201d one.

For the reasons already developed ante,\nI believe that Section 38.04(a) of the statute\u2014as it currently reads\u2014\nplainly does. And to the extent that the 1993 amendment eliminated the\nunlawfulness exception from the statute, it does not affect that\nconclusion\u2014at all. The Court errs to think otherwise.\n         IV. THE STATUTE\u2019S PLAIN MEANING IS NOT ABSURD\n      The Court also declares that to adopt what I take to be the plain\nmeaning \u201cleads to absurd results.\u201d Majority Opinion at 8. The Court says\nthe question of the lawfulness of the arrest is \u201cmore appropriately\nhandled by a trial court[.]\u201d Id. at 9. Better to continue to treat the issue\nof lawfulness as an exception, notwithstanding the 1993 amendment,\nthe Court apparently believes. Id. But there are several problems with\nthis approach.\n      First and foremost, it is a distortion of the \u201cabsurdity\u201d exception\nto the primacy of plain meaning in statutory construction. That the\nCourt can think of an interpretation of the statute that would be more\n\u201cappropriate\u201d does not grant the Court leave to ignore plain meaning.\n\u201cThe oddity or anomaly of certain consequences may be a perfectly valid\nreason for choosing one textually permissible interpretation over\nanother,\u201d the late Justice Scalia and Professor Garner have observed,\nbut in the face of statutory text the consequences of which are plain, \u201cit\nis no basis for disregarding or changing the text.\u201d Antonin Scalia &amp;\nBryan Garner, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 237\n(2012). Applying the absurdity exception to distort plain meaning, as the\n\f                                                          NICHOLSON \u2013 14\n\n\n\n\nCourt does today, runs counter to the principle that \u201c[t]he doctrine does\nnot include substantive errors arising from a drafter\u2019s failure to\nappreciate the effect of certain provisions.\u201d Id. at 238. Otherwise, the\nabsurdity exception lends itself to \u201cthe charge that it is an application\nnot of textualism but of purposivism\u2014seeking to give the text not the\nmeaning that it objectively conveys but the meaning that was in the\nmind of the drafter.\u201d Id.\n       I have elsewhere registered my profound disapproval of this\n\u201ceffectuate-the-legislative-intent\u201d brand of statutory construction.

But that is what the Court does today.\n       In any event, the Court today also greatly exaggerates the\nanomaly of forcing the State to prove that the accused was aware of the\nlawfulness of the peace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him. 12 Under the\n\n       12 The Court at one point says that \u201cwhether an arrest or detention is\n\nlawful or unlawful has resulted in casebooks of technical and fact-intensive\njurisprudence.\u201d Majority Opinion at 9.

Sept. 1, 1994; TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02(b). 13 Proof\nin accordance with this former requirement would no doubt often involve\nthe development of the circumstances of the arrest itself. Those\ncircumstances will at least more often than not, I believe, serve just as\nwell to establish the answer to whether the accused was aware that the\npeace officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was patently lawful. Indeed, the\nfacts of this case provide a ready example.\n  V. THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO PROVE KNOWLEDGE\n       By the time the police officer in this case attempted to arrest\nAppellant, he (Appellant) had committed several offenses within the\nofficer\u2019s presence, including littering and failure to present a valid\ndriver\u2019s license upon request. Nicholson, 594 S.W.3d at 487. Moreover,\nAppellant had \u201cactive felony warrants\u201d out for his arrest. Id. Even before\nhe attempted to flee the scene, Appellant\u2019s conduct showed a will to\nresist the officer\u2019s efforts to question him and detain him at the scene\nuntil backup units could arrive. Id. at 487\u201388. From these facts a jury\n\n\njurisprudence.\u201d So, I do not understand why the Court finds it absurd today,\nin this circumstance, that the statute should plainly require the State to show\nthat a defendant knew that an officer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful.\n\n       13 Section 2.02(b) provides: \u201cThe prosecuting attorney must negate the\n\nexistence of an exception in the accusation charging commission of the offense\nand prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant or defendant\u2019s conduct\ndoes not fall within the exception.\u201d\n\f                                                          NICHOLSON \u2013 16\n\n\n\n\nmight rationally\u2014indeed, even readily\u2014have inferred not just that the\nattempted arrest was lawful, but that Appellant was aware that he was\nsubject to lawful arrest. I agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nthe evidence was legally sufficient to establish this fact to a level of\nconfidence beyond a reasonable doubt. 14\n       That being the case, then, of course it does not matter whether\nSection 38.04(a) requires proof of that fact; Appellant was not entitled\nto an acquittal even if it does. And the court of appeals did not err to\ndecline to ultimately resolve that question, since it could finally dispose\nof the legal sufficiency issue without doing so. On this basis, I would\nreject Appellant\u2019s second ground for review, and I would accordingly\ndismiss Appellant\u2019s first ground for review as moot.\n                             VI. CONCLUSION\n       The Court ultimately disposes of the case today by affirming the\ncourt of appeals\u2019 uncontested reversal based on jury charge error\u2014\nnamely, the failure of the charge to require the jury to find Appellant\nwas aware that the officer was attempting to arrest him at the time of\nthe offense. Majority Opinion at 11. With this much, I agree. But the\nCourt then remands the case to the trial court for a new trial based upon\nthis manifest trial error that the Court never even addresses on the\n\n\n       14 Chief Justice Gray filed a dissenting opinion in which he argued that\n\nSection 38.04(a) does indeed require proof that Appellant was aware that the\nofficer\u2019s attempt to arrest him was lawful. Nicholson, 594 S.W.3d at 492. But\nhe believed the evidence was insufficient to prove this element of the offense,\nand he would have acquitted Appellant on that basis. Id. Interestingly, he\nneither explained in what way he thought the evidence was lacking in that\nregard, nor did he even attempt to explicitly refute the majority\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n\f                                                             NICHOLSON \u2013 17\n\n\n\n\nmerits in its opinion. 15\n       It is also a mystery to me exactly why the Court even takes up the\nquestion of whether the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury should also have\ninstructed the jury that it must find Appellant was aware that the\nattempted arrest was also lawful as a predicate to conviction, unless the\nCourt simply desires to inform the lower court of its views on that\nissue. 16 The court of appeals did not find it necessary to resolve that\nissue. And its failure to do so cannot have been an error so long as it was\ncorrect to hold that the evidence was legally sufficient, in any event, to\nprove that fact\u2014an issue the Court today never even acknowledges,\nmuch less addresses.\n       In my view, it is appropriate for this Court to affirm the judgment\nof the court of appeals remanding for trial error. I believe that is the case\nbecause I agree with the court of appeals that the evidence would prove\nknowledge of the lawfulness of the attempted arrest, even assuming\n(without deciding) that proof of that fact is necessary under a plain\nreading of Section 38.04(a). Acquittal is not called for, but reversal for\ntrial error, which the court of appeals has already done, is. I therefore\nconcur in the result the Court announces today. But I cannot join its\nopinion.\n\n\n       15 Of course, this Court, at least in its capacity as a discretionary review\n\ncourt, should not purport to remand the case for a new trial. By affirming the\njudgment of the court of appeals, we leave standing that court\u2019s disposition,\nwhich is where the order to remand occurred. We need not and should not order\nthe remand ourselves.\n\n       16 But this is anomalous since Texas courts are not empowered to give\n\nadvisory opinions. Petetan v.

A nurse was struck and killed by\nsuch a driver while crossing the public street next to the hospital where\nshe worked. The trial court and court of appeals held that the hospital\nowed a specialized, case-specific duty to the nurse because the layout of\n\fits exit and parking lot created a situation in which injury to others was\nforeseeable.\n      We hold that courts should not attempt to craft case-specific\nduties when recognized duty rules apply to the factual situation at hand.\nUnder these recognized rules, the hospital had a limited duty as a\npremises occupier based on its exercise of control over certain parts of\nthe adjoining public right-of-way. But there is no evidence that any\ndangerous condition the hospital controlled in the right-of-way caused\nthe nurse\u2019s harm. Accordingly, we reverse and render a take-nothing\njudgment.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n      Defendant HNMC owns and operates a hospital and a fenced\nparking lot in Northwest Houston. The hospital and lot are on either\nside of Cali Drive, a North\u2013South street owned and maintained by\nHarris County. The county\u2019s right-of-way for Cali Drive extends past\neither side of the street and includes the curb, grass medians, and\nsidewalks.\n      One exit from the hospital opens to stairs that lead down to the\nsidewalk abutting Cali Drive in the middle of the block. Near the bottom\nof the stairs, in the county right-of-way, HNMC constructed a concrete\npad between the sidewalk and the street. The record includes evidence\nthat HNMC built the pad to help drivers drop off and pick up passengers\non Cali Drive. The pad is located across Cali Drive from the driveway\nthat cars use to enter and exit the parking lot. But the hospital exit and\nthe parking lot driveway do not line up exactly\u2014the driveway is a few\nfeet North of the hospital exit. On the parking-lot side of the street,\n\n\n\n\n                                    2\n\fHNMC placed traffic control signs in the county right-of-way to the\nNorth of the driveway.\n      There are crosswalks at each end of the block that connect the\nhospital to the parking lot\u2019s pedestrian gates. But rather than walking\nto the end of the block, using the crosswalks, and using the pedestrian\ngates to access the lot, many of the hospital\u2019s patients, visitors, and\nemployees who exit the building here simply cross Cali Drive in the\nmiddle of the block and enter the lot through the driveway. There was\na crosswalk in the middle of the block as recently as 2011, but the county\nabandoned the crosswalk, and its markings faded over time.            The\nabandoned crosswalk did not line up with the hospital exit, the concrete\npad, or the parking lot driveway. Instead, the abandoned crosswalk was\nlocated a few feet South of the hospital exit and the concrete pad.\n      From 2008 through 2012, there were several vehicle accidents on\nCali Drive involving pedestrians.       Concerned, HNMC wrote to the\ncounty in 2009, asking it to implement new safety measures on Cali\nDrive. The county conducted a traffic study, undertook some safety\nmeasures, and unilaterally recommended that HNMC take additional\nsafety measures. HNMC did not take the recommended measures.\n      In 2015, after HNMC declined to take the safety measures and\nafter the abandoned crosswalk had mostly faded, Leny Chan was killed\nwhile crossing Cali Drive. A nurse employed by HNMC for more than\n30 years, Chan was leaving work and walking to her car located in the\nHNMC parking lot. She came out of the hospital exit and proceeded to\ncross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, intending to enter the\nparking lot via the driveway.\n\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\f      At the same time, James Budd was beginning to leave the parking\nlot in his car. He reached the driveway, pulled up past the traffic control\nsignage located in the right-of-way to his right, and stopped. He looked\nto his left (South), his right (North), and then looked forward as he began\nto turn left out of the parking lot to proceed South on Cali Drive. Budd\nstruck Chan as he was turning left. Emergency services responded, but\nChan died that evening as a result of her injuries.\n      Chan\u2019s estate and surviving family members (collectively Chan)\nsued Budd and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Budd\u2019s employer.\nSiemens designated HNMC and Harris County as responsible third\nparties, and Chan then added HNMC as a defendant. At the end of trial,\nthe jury was given an ordinary negligence charge and found all parties\nnegligent. The jury apportioned liability as follows: 40% to Budd, 30%\nto Harris County, 20% to HNMC, and 10% to Chan. The trial court\nrendered judgment on the verdict, and Chan settled with Budd and\nSiemens.\n      HNMC appealed, arguing among other things that (1) it owed no\nduty to Chan, (2) Chan failed to obtain a premises liability finding,\n(3) there is no evidence of liability or damages, and (4) any liability is\nbarred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because Chan was an HNMC\nemployee leaving work when she was killed. A panel of the court of\nappeals agreed with the first argument and reversed, holding that\nHNMC had no duty to ensure Chan\u2019s safety while crossing the street\nand rendering a take-nothing judgment. HNMC, Inc. v. Chan, No. 14-\n18-00849-CV, 2020 WL 2832780, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\fMay 28, 2020), withdrawn and superseded on reconsideration en banc,\n637 S.W.3d 919 (2021).\n      But the court granted reconsideration en banc and affirmed the\ntrial court\u2019s judgment in a 5-4 decision. Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 926. The\nen banc majority noted the general rule that property owners owe no\nduty to make safe public roadways appurtenant to their property and\nidentified four exceptions to that rule. Id. at 929. Instead of applying\nany of these rules, however, the majority recognized a new duty specific\nto this situation by analyzing the factors listed in Greater Houston\nTransportation Co. v. Phillips.     Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 930-36 (citing\nPhillips, 801 S.W.2d 523, 525 (Tex. 1990)). The majority next concluded\nthat HNMC had invited any error regarding the failure to secure a\npremises liability finding and that sufficient evidence supported the\nverdict. Id. at 936-940. And the majority held that HNMC failed to\nassign error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to apply the Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act because HNMC\u2019s appellate brief attacked only the\ndenial of its motion for summary judgment, which is not reviewable on\nappeal following a trial. Id. at 928 (citing Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v.\nCates, 927 S.W.2d 623, 625 (Tex. 1996)).1\n\n\n\n\n      1 Federal precedent had similarly been against the reviewability of a\n\ndenial of summary judgment, but the Supreme Court of the United States\nrecently held that the denial of summary judgment on purely legal grounds\nmay be challenged on appeal. Dupree v. Younger, 598 U.S. 729, 735-36 (2023).\nBecause we decide this case on duty and evidentiary issues, we have no\noccasion to consider whether Dupree should inform our own standard on the\nreviewability of summary judgment denials.\n\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f                               ANALYSIS\n\n      HNMC raises two issues in its petition for review. First, it argues\nthat it did not owe a duty of reasonable care to Chan while she was\ncrossing Cali Drive. Second, HNMC contends that because Chan was\nleaving her place of employment when she was hit, the Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act bars any liability to HNMC, her employer. Because\nboth issues raise questions of law, we review them de novo. Aleman v.\nTex. Med. Bd., 573 S.W.3d 796, 802 (Tex. 2019).\n\nI.    HNMC had a limited duty to Chan because it placed a\n      concrete pad, driveway, and signs in the county\n      right-of-way.\n\n      \u201cThe threshold inquiry in a negligence case is duty.\u201d Elephant\nIns. Co., LLC v. Kenyon, 644 S.W.3d 137, 144 (Tex. 2022) (quoting\nPhillips, 801 S.W.2d at 525). Whether a defendant owes a plaintiff a\nduty \u201cis a question of law for the court to decide from the facts\nsurrounding the occurrence in question.\u201d Phillips, 801 S.W.2d at 525.\nBut courts should only consider recognizing a new duty \u201c[w]hen a duty\nhas not been recognized in particular circumstances.\u201d Pagayon v. Exxon\nMobil Corp., 536 S.W.3d 499, 503 (Tex. 2017); see also Kenyon, 644\nS.W.3d at 144. If a court has not already decided whether certain\ncircumstances will give rise to a duty, the relevant question is \u201cwhether\na duty should be imposed in a defined class of cases.\u201d Pagayon, 536\nS.W.3d at 504; see also Houston Area Safety Council, Inc. v. Mendez, 671\nS.W.3d 580, 583 (Tex. 2023).      We therefore begin our analysis by\nconsidering whether certain recognized duty or no-duty rules apply in\nthese circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\f       A.     Because duty rules already address this class of\n              cases, the Phillips factors should not be used to\n              create a duty.\n\n       Relying on authority from other courts of appeals, the en banc\nmajority identified a background no-duty rule and four \u201cexceptions\u201d in\nwhich a premises owner may owe a duty to persons who are not on its\nproperty. Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 929-930. Our Court\u2019s precedent has\ndescribed these rules somewhat differently.\n       The majority correctly articulated a background no-duty rule for\nadjacent streets: \u201ca property owner . . . has no duty to ensure the safety\nof a person who leaves the owner\u2019s property and suffers injury on an\nadjacent public roadway, or to ensure that person\u2019s safety against the\ndangerous acts of a third party.\u201d Id. at 929. As we explain below, this\nrule is supported by our precedent, and it applies to a defined class of\ncases that includes the facts of this case.\n       The en banc majority then opined that this rule \u201cis subject to\ncertain exceptions,\u201d and it cited several of our cases. Id. But most of the\ncases cited do not directly address duties on public roads, so they are not\ntruly exceptions to the background no-duty rule. Rather, they describe\ncertain classes of cases in which we have recognized that a defendant\ncan owe a duty on premises it does not own or occupy. And the parties\nin this case dispute whether the facts here\u2014which do involve a public\nroad\u2014fall within any of these classes.2\n\n\n       2 We confine our analysis to the duty rules addressed by the parties and\n\ndo not attempt to identify an exhaustive list of rules that could inform whether\na duty exists on these facts. See In re City of Lubbock, 666 S.W.3d 546, 556\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2023) (citing United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f      The first duty is that owed by a party who \u201cundertakes to make\n[a] premises safe for others.\u201d Wilson v. Tex. Parks & Wildlife Dep\u2019t, 8\nS.W.3d 634, 635 (Tex. 1999).       The second is the duty owed by a\nlandowner whose land contains a dangerous condition or excavation\nappurtenant to a public highway. See Alamo Nat\u2019l Bank v. Kraus, 616\nS.W.2d 908, 910 (Tex. 1981). The third is the duty owed by a property\nowner or occupier who assumes actual control of adjacent property. See\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Alexander, 868 S.W.2d 322, 324 (Tex. 1993).\nAnd the fourth is the duty owed by a property owner or occupier who\nknows of an obscured danger near the entrance or exit of his property.\nSee Renfro Drug Co. v. Lewis, 235 S.W.2d 609, 615 (Tex. 1950). We\ndiscuss each of these duties below.\n      After setting out all of these rules regarding duty, the majority\ndid not analyze their application. Instead, it proceeded to apply the\nfactors listed in Greater Houston Transportation Co. v. Phillips to\ndetermine whether HNMC owed a duty to Chan. See Chan, 637 S.W.3d\nat 930-36. This was error.\n      When a duty or no-duty rule already exists that contemplates a\nparticular case\u2019s factual situation, the balance addressed in Phillips has\nbeen struck. Thus, there is no need to apply the Phillips factors, and\ndoing so is improper. The Phillips factors are inapplicable in cases\nwhere there is a duty rule that takes the factual circumstances at issue\ninto account. See Pagayon, 536 S.W.3d at 503; cf. Mendez, 671 S.W.3d\nat 583-85 (analyzing whether existence of duty \u201cremained an open\n\n\n1575, 1579 (2020)); Pike v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, 610 S.W.3d 763, 782 (Tex.\n2020).\n\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fquestion\u201d before applying Phillips factors). And even when there is no\nduty rule, the analysis contemplated in Phillips may only be used to\nidentify a class of cases in which a duty exists, not to craft a duty tailored\nto the unique facts of an individual case. As we have explained, \u201cthe\nfactual situation presented must be evaluated in the broader context of\nsimilarly situated actors. The question is whether a duty should be\nimposed in a defined class of cases, not whether the facts of the case at\nhand show a breach.\u201d Pagayon, 536 S.W.3d at 504.\n       Here, the en banc majority recognized that at least one of the duty\nrules applies to the factual circumstances in this case: a property owner\nor occupier generally owes no duty to make an appurtenant roadway\nsafe for those leaving the property. That recognition alone demonstrates\nthat balancing the Phillips factors is inappropriate. Moreover, as our\nanalysis below makes clear, other rules addressing when a landowner\nowes a duty to persons not on its property can also be applied to help\nanswer the duty question on these facts. For these reasons, the majority\nerred in analyzing duty by balancing the Phillips factors.\n\n       B.     HNMC owed Chan a limited duty because it\n              exercised some control over the adjacent\n              right-of-way.\n\n       Having concluded that the Phillips factors are not a proper\nframework for analyzing the duty question in this case, we next consider\nwhether the various duty rules identified by the court of appeals and\naddressed by the parties give rise to a duty here. We address each rule\nin turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\f              1.      HNMC had no duty to ensure Chan\u2019s safety\n                      while she was crossing an adjacent public\n                      road.\n\n       We first consider the background no-duty rule articulated by the\nen banc majority: \u201ca property owner . . . has no duty to ensure the safety\nof a person who leaves the owner\u2019s property and suffers injury on an\nadjacent public roadway, or to ensure that person\u2019s safety against the\ndangerous acts of a third party.\u201d Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 929. We described\nthe principle behind this \u201cwell-established rule of law\u201d in Grapotte v.\nAdams, holding that a property owner had no duty to ensure the safety\nof a sidewalk abutting his property because the sidewalk was\nmaintained by the city, so any duty would rest on the city rather than\nthe neighboring owner. 111 S.W.2d 690, 691 (Tex. 1938). We have also\nrecognized time and again that generally \u201cone person is under no duty\nto control the conduct of another.\u201d         Nabors Drilling, U.S.A., Inc. v.\nEscoto, 288 S.W.3d 401, 404 (Tex. 2009).3\n       This no-duty rule contemplates the factual situation in this case.\nChan left HNMC\u2019s property and was struck in the public roadway by a\ncareless driver. As acknowledged by the Restatement, \u201cno one would\nthink that a land possessor did have a duty of care to others for\nconditions not caused by the possessor on public highways and streets\nadjacent to the possessor\u2019s land.\u201d          RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS:\n\n\n       3 See also Triplex Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Riley, 900 S.W.2d 716, 720 (Tex.\n\n1995) (\u201cAs a general rule, there is no legal duty in Texas to control the actions\nof third persons.\u201d); Phillips, 801 S.W.2d at 525 (same); Otis Eng\u2019g Corp. v.\nClark, 668 S.W.2d 307, 309 (Tex. 1983) (\u201cAs a general rule, one person is under\nno duty to control the conduct of another.\u201d (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF\nTORTS \u00a7 315 (Am. L. Inst. 1965))).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fLIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 54 cmt. d (Am. L. Inst.\n2012). Moreover, HNMC was under no duty to control the actions of\nBudd, the careless third-party driver who struck Chan.\n      Because this rule applies to the factual situation at issue here,\nHNMC owed no duty to Chan on the ground that she had left its\nproperty and was crossing an adjacent roadway. Thus, we turn to the\nother duty rules identified by the parties.\n\n             2.     HNMC did not agree or contract to make the\n                    road safe for others.\n\n      We next consider the duty that applies when \u201ca person . . . agrees\nor contracts, either expressly or impliedly, to make safe a known,\ndangerous condition of real property.\u201d        Holland v. Mem\u2019l Hermann\nHealth Sys., 570 S.W.3d 887, 897 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2018,\nno pet.). We addressed this rule in Wilson v. Texas Parks & Wildlife\nDepartment, holding that \u201ca party who does not own, occupy, or control\n[the] premises may nevertheless owe a duty of due care if it undertakes\nto make the premises safe for others.\u201d 8 S.W.3d at 635; see also City of\nDenton v. Page, 701 S.W.2d 831, 834-35 (Tex. 1986). Wilson makes clear\nthat this duty rule springs from the common-law doctrine of negligent\nundertaking, which sounds in ordinary negligence. See 8 S.W.3d at 635\nn.4 (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 323 (Am. L. Inst.\n1965)); see also Kenyon, 644 S.W.3d at 151 (explaining the doctrine).\n      In this case, there is no evidence that HNMC agreed or contracted\nwith anyone to reduce or eliminate the danger of crossing Cali Drive.\nInstead, HNMC reached out to the county\u2014the entity responsible for\nthe safety of the street\u2014and requested that it make changes. By asking\n\n\n\n\n                                   11\n\fa neighboring landowner to make its property safer, the requesting\nparty does not undertake that obligation itself. The record also shows\nthat the county responded in part by unilaterally suggesting that\nHNMC perform certain tasks, but HNMC did not do so.              HNMC\u2019s\ninaction is not an agreement\u2014express or implied\u2014to make crossing\nCali Drive safer. See Nall v. Plunkett, 404 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. 2013)\n(explaining that claim for negligent undertaking requires that \u201cthe\ndefendant undertook to perform services\u201d for another). Accordingly,\nHNMC did not undertake a duty to Chan.\n\n             3.     The artificial conditions HNMC created were\n                    either not on its property or not unreasonably\n                    dangerous.\n\n      Next, we consider the duty of an \u201cowner or occupant of premises\nabutting a highway\u201d to refrain from \u201cjeopardiz[ing] or endanger[ing] the\nsafety of persons using the highway as a means of passage or travel.\u201d\nKraus, 616 S.W.2d at 910. This duty rule, which we articulated in\nKraus, sounds in premises liability and has a long history. See Atchison\nv. Tex. & Pac. Ry., 186 S.W.2d 228, 229 (Tex. 1945). Our cases have\napplied it only when the premises owned or occupied by the defendant\ncontains \u201can excavation or other artificial condition so near an existing\nhighway that [the owner or occupier] realizes or should realize that it\ninvolves an unreasonable risk to others . . . traveling on the highway.\u201d\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 368. Notably, this rule applies only\nto conditions that, \u201cas and when created, involve unreasonable risk of\nphysical harm to persons outside the land because of their plan,\nconstruction, location, or otherwise.\u201d Id. \u00a7 364 cmt. a; see also id. \u00a7 368\ncmt. a (explaining that section 368 is a \u201cspecial application of the rule\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\fstated in [section] 364\u201d). Moreover, the rule applies only when the\nproperty owner or possessor \u201cknows or should know [the condition is]\nunreasonably dangerous.\u201d Id. \u00a7 368 cmt. h.\n       Unlike the next rule we discuss, this particular rule does not\naddress conditions outside the land, so it imposes no duty on HNMC\nregarding the conditions it created in the county right-of-way.\nAccordingly, the concrete pad, the parking lot driveway, and the signs\ncannot support a duty under this rule. In addition, there is no evidence\nthat the conditions Chan identifies on HNMC\u2019s property\u2014the hospital\nexit, the stairs leading down to the street, and the parking lot itself\u2014\nwere dangerous. Nothing inherent in those conditions presented an\nunreasonable risk of harm to those traveling on Cali Drive.\nAccordingly, HNMC owed no duty to Chan under this rule.\n       The parties also discuss some court of appeals decisions that have\napplied the Kraus rule to the release of a dangerous agency from a\nlandowner\u2019s property onto a public road.4           We have not had an\nopportunity to address this application of the rule, which appears to be\nrooted in a different section of the Restatement recognizing liability for\n\n\n\n       4 See, e.g., Hirabayashi v.

This case provides us with no such opportunity, as there\n\nwas no negligent activity on HNMC\u2019s land that could give rise to a duty.\n\n              4.     HNMC exercised control over parts of the\n                     right-of-way by constructing the concrete pad,\n                     driveway, and signs.\n\n       We next consider the duty that applies to a property owner or\noccupier who \u201cassumes actual control over a portion of adjacent\nproperty.\u201d Guereque v. Thompson, 953 S.W.2d 458, 467 (Tex. App.\u2014El\nPaso 1997, pet. denied). We recognized this duty in Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. v.

We have also \u201crecognized\nthat under some circumstances, one who creates a dangerous condition, even\nthough he or she is not in control of the premises when the injury occurs, owes\na duty of due care.\u201d Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 912 (Tex.\n1997).\n       6 See also County of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 556 (Tex. 2002)\n\n(\u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether the defendant assumed sufficient control\n\n\n\n\n                                      14\n\fhas no duty to ensure the safety of others on adjacent property that is\nnot within its control.\u201d Holland, 570 S.W.3d at 897; see also Grapotte,\n111 S.W.2d at 691 (looking to actual control to determine whether\ndefendant owed duty to make appurtenant sidewalk safe).\n       Here, the parties agree that HNMC exercised control over parts\nof the county-owned right-of-way adjacent to its property by\nconstructing a concrete pad next to the street on the hospital side of Cali\nDrive, constructing a driveway over the right-of-way on the other side\nfor cars to use in traveling between the parking lot and the street, and\nerecting traffic control signs in the right-of-way next to the driveway.\nAccordingly, HNMC had a duty to address any dangerous conditions in\nthose limited areas of the right-of-way where it actually exercised\ncontrol.\n\n              5.     A careless driver in the public road is not an\n                     obscured danger.\n\n       Finally, we consider the duty that applies to property owners and\noccupiers when \u201can obscured danger exists on land directly appurtenant\nto the land owned or occupied, and where that danger is near a place\nwhere invitees enter and exit the landowner\u2019s or occupier\u2019s property.\u201d\nHolland, 570 S.W.3d at 897. This duty sounds in premises liability, and\nwe applied it in Renfro Drug. 235 S.W.2d at 615 (\u201cThe duty to keep the\npremises in a reasonably safe condition was not limited to the rented . . .\n\n\nover the part of the premises that presented the alleged danger so that the\ndefendant had the responsibility to remedy it.\u201d); cf. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d at\n912 (holding that \u201c[b]y simply erecting a wall around its own leased premises\nto separate that space from the rest of the building, Science Spectrum did not\nexercise control over the area adjacent to its premises\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                     15\n\fspace alone but extended as well to the entrances into and the exits from\nthe [occupied space].\u201d). On the other hand, a property owner or occupier\nhas no duty to make safe or warn of a \u201cdangerous condition that is\nundisputedly open and obvious.\u201d SandRidge Energy, Inc. v. Barfield,\n642 S.W.3d 560, 563 (Tex. 2022) (citing Los Compadres Pescadores,\nL.L.C.     v.   Valdez,   622   S.W.3d    771,   788   (Tex.   2021)   (citing\nMassman-Johnson v. Gundolf, 484 S.W.2d 555, 556-57 (Tex. 1972))).\n         Here, Chan was injured by an open and obvious danger: a careless\ndriver. Although she characterizes certain conditions both on and off\nHNMC\u2019s property as dangerous and asserts that those conditions\ncontributed to the situation that led to Chan\u2019s death, nothing about the\nconditions she identifies was obscured or made those conditions\ndangerous in and of themselves.          See Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 960-61\n(Jewell, J., dissenting). Rather, it was Budd\u2019s careless driving that\nultimately killed Chan, and nothing about that danger was obscured\neither. The risk of injury inherent in crossing any busy street as a\npedestrian is unquestionably open and obvious. HNMC thus owed no\nduty under this rule.\n\nII.      HNMC\u2019s limited duty does not support the judgment.\n\n         Having determined the contours of the duty owed by HNMC, we\nnext consider whether the jury\u2019s finding that HNMC was negligent\nsupports the judgment in Chan\u2019s favor. We conclude that it does not.\nUnder the negligence question submitted to the jury, we hold there is no\nevidence that a dangerous condition controlled by HNMC proximately\ncaused Chan\u2019s death.\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\f      The jury charge.        Before addressing the sufficiency of the\nevidence, we caution that parties should consider carefully whether each\napplicable duty sounds in premises liability or ordinary negligence so\nthat the correct question(s) can be included in the jury charge. We have\nheld in several cases that a jury\u2019s affirmative answer to an ordinary\nnegligence question cannot support a recovery for injury caused by a\npremises defect. E.g., United Scaffolding, Inc. v. Levine, 537 S.W.3d\n463, 472 (Tex. 2017). Absent special instructions or definitions, a jury\nquestion regarding negligent activity does not include the essential\nelements of a defendant\u2019s liability for failing to exercise reasonable care\nin warning about or making safe a dangerous premises condition. See\nid. (citing Clayton W. Williams, Jr., Inc. v. Olivo, 952 S.W.2d 523, 529\n(Tex. 1997); Keetch v. Kroger Co., 845 S.W.2d 262, 266-67 (Tex. 1992);\nH.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Warner, 845 S.W.2d 258, 259-60 (Tex. 1992)).\nThus, if a defendant properly preserves the issue, the remedy for\nsubmitting a negligent activity question when the defendant\u2019s duty\nsounds in premises liability is rendition of a take-nothing judgment.\nUnited Scaffolding, 537 S.W.3d at 483.\n      As discussed above, some of the duties addressed by the parties\nhere sound in ordinary negligence while others sound in premises\nliability. The exercise-of-control duty that we have concluded HNMC\nowed sounds in premises liability. In Wal-Mart Stores v. Alexander, we\nheld that a property owner or occupier \u201cis responsible for those areas\nadjacent to the demised premises which it actually controls.\u201d          868\nS.W.2d at 324. In so doing, we cited the Second Restatement\u2019s definition\nof \u201cpossessor of land\u201d for the assertion that a party exercising actual\n\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\fcontrol over land owes premises-type duties in the area it controls. See\nid. (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 328E; Atchison, Topeka &\nSanta Fe Ry. v. Smith, 563 S.W.2d 660, 665-66 (Tex. Civ. App.\u2014Waco\n1978, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); Howe v. Kroger Co., 598 S.W.2d 929, 930 (Tex.\nCiv. App.\u2014Dallas 1980, no writ)). Accordingly, to hold a defendant\nliable for breaching this duty with respect to defective conditions it\ncontrols, a premises liability question must be submitted to the jury.\n      But in this case, the jury charge included only an ordinary\nnegligence question and instructions. The charge defined negligence as\n\u201cthe failure to use ordinary care\u201d and then asked whether \u201cthe\nnegligence, if any, of [Budd, HNMC, Chan, or Harris County]\nproximately cause[d Chan\u2019s] death.\u201d The charge thus failed to include\nthe essential elements of a premises liability claim.        See United\nScaffolding, 537 S.W.3d at 472 (citing Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,\n648 S.W.2d 292, 296 (Tex. 1983)).\n      The en banc majority held that HNMC invited any charge error\nby opposing a premises liability submission requested by a different\ndefendant. See Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 937 (citing Del Lago Partners, Inc.\nv. Smith, 307 S.W.3d 762, 775 (Tex. 2010)). Chief Justice Christopher\ndisagreed in dissent, contending that it was Chan\u2019s obligation to ensure\nthat a charge sufficient for her theory of liability was submitted to the\njury, and HNMC was under no obligation to object to the incorrect\nsubmission. See id. at 950 (Christopher, C.J., dissenting) (citing United\nScaffolding, 537 S.W.3d at 481). Because HNMC has not challenged the\nmajority\u2019s holding about invited error in this Court, we express no view\nregarding whether it was correct.\n\n\n\n\n                                    18\n\f       The evidence. Instead, HNMC argues that the charge required\nproof of breach and proximate cause that Chan failed to provide. Having\nreviewed the record, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that\nthe areas of the public right-of-way controlled by HNMC included\nunreasonably dangerous conditions that proximately caused Chan\u2019s\ndeath. Ultimately, the hazard Chan faced was a careless driver on Cali\nDrive: a hazard for which HNMC was not responsible in an area where\nit had not exercised control.\n       The concrete pad and driveway: The evidence at trial showed\nthat HNMC installed both the concrete pad and the parking lot driveway\nin the public right-of-way on opposite sides of Cali Drive. Chan contends\nthat these features, combined with the location of the hospital exit and\nadjoining stairs on HNMC\u2019s property, \u201cconcentrated\u201d vehicles and\npedestrians into the same area and \u201cfunneled\u201d exiting pedestrians over\nthe public sidewalk and HNMC\u2019s concrete pad, into the public street and\nthrough the county\u2019s abandoned crosswalk, and then across the public\nright-of-way on the other side and into the driveway of HNMC\u2019s parking\nlot.\n       But the record shows that HNMC did not control the abandoned\ncrosswalk, and that the crosswalk did not connect to either the pad or\nthe driveway\u2014it was located to the South of both. In addition, there is\nno evidence that the condition of the pad or the driveway posed an\nunreasonable risk of harm. For example, there were no \u201cfunneling\u201d rails\nor other barriers on the sidewalk or concrete pad that made it\nunreasonably difficult for Chan to access the marked crosswalks at the\nends of the block.\n\n\n\n\n                                   19\n\f      Nor is there any evidence that Budd\u2019s careless driving upon\nexiting the driveway was influenced by the condition of the driveway.\nWhen Chan faced the driver in the street, both she and the driver had\nleft the area of the public right-of-way where HNMC exercised control.\nFor these reasons, no reasonable jury could find that HNMC breached\nits duty regarding a dangerous condition of the pad or driveway in a\nmanner that proximately caused Chan\u2019s death.\n      The signs: Chan also contends that the signs HNMC placed in\nthe right-of-way North of the driveway blocked the view of drivers\nexiting the parking lot. But Budd gave uncontroverted testimony that\nhe pulled up beyond the signs to his right and stopped before observing\nCali Drive in each direction, and that he was looking forward\u2014in the\ndirection his vehicle was moving and away from the signs\u2014when he\nturned left out of the parking lot and struck Chan. Another HNMC\nemployee walking with Chan confirmed that Budd was looking forward\nwhen he hit Chan. The signs to Budd\u2019s right thus did nothing to obscure\nhis view to the left, where he was turning and Chan was crossing. And\nChan\u2019s crossing location was in the street South of the driveway, outside\nthe area where HNMC exercised control. Accordingly, no reasonable\njury could find that the signs HNMC placed in the right-of-way, even if\ndangerous, proximately caused Chan\u2019s death. Because the evidence is\nlegally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of proximate cause\nregarding the signs or its finding of breach regarding the pad or\ndriveway, HNMC is entitled to a take-nothing judgment. See Sw. Key\nProgram, Inc. v. Gil-Perez, 81 S.W.3d 269, 270 (Tex. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                   20\n\f                              CONCLUSION\n\n       Generally, a property owner or occupier owes no duty to make an\nadjoining public road safe or to warn of potential danger in the roadway.\nBut when a property owner exercises actual control over adjacent\nproperty, it does owe premises liability duties to those injured by\nconditions in the controlled area. Here, HNMC exercised control over\nlimited areas of the public right-of-way abutting Cali Drive. But Chan\nwas not injured by conditions in the controlled area. Instead, she was\ntragically killed by the careless acts of a third-party driver, a risk for\nwhich HNMC was not responsible and from which it had no duty to\nprotect Chan.   We therefore reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment\naffirming the judgment on the verdict in Chan\u2019s favor, and we render\njudgment that the Chan parties take nothing.        See TEX. R.

A nurse was struck and killed by\nsuch a driver while crossing the public street next to the hospital where\nshe worked. The trial court and court of appeals held that the hospital\nowed a specialized, case-specific duty to the nurse because the layout of\n\fits exit and parking lot created a situation in which injury to others was\nforeseeable.\n      We hold that courts should not attempt to craft case-specific\nduties when recognized duty rules apply to the factual situation at hand.\nUnder these recognized rules, the hospital had a limited duty as a\npremises occupier based on its exercise of control over certain parts of\nthe adjoining public right-of-way. But there is no evidence that any\ndangerous condition the hospital controlled in the right-of-way caused\nthe nurse\u2019s harm. Accordingly, we reverse and render a take-nothing\njudgment.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n      Defendant HNMC owns and operates a hospital and a fenced\nparking lot in Northwest Houston. The hospital and lot are on either\nside of Cali Drive, a North\u2013South street owned and maintained by\nHarris County. The county\u2019s right-of-way for Cali Drive extends past\neither side of the street and includes the curb, grass medians, and\nsidewalks.\n      One exit from the hospital opens to stairs that lead down to the\nsidewalk abutting Cali Drive in the middle of the block. Near the bottom\nof the stairs, in the county right-of-way, HNMC constructed a concrete\npad between the sidewalk and the street. The record includes evidence\nthat HNMC built the pad to help drivers drop off and pick up passengers\non Cali Drive. The pad is located across Cali Drive from the driveway\nthat cars use to enter and exit the parking lot. But the hospital exit and\nthe parking lot driveway do not line up exactly\u2014the driveway is a few\nfeet North of the hospital exit. On the parking-lot side of the street,\n\n\n\n\n                                    2\n\fHNMC placed traffic control signs in the county right-of-way to the\nNorth of the driveway.\n      There are crosswalks at each end of the block that connect the\nhospital to the parking lot\u2019s pedestrian gates. But rather than walking\nto the end of the block, using the crosswalks, and using the pedestrian\ngates to access the lot, many of the hospital\u2019s patients, visitors, and\nemployees who exit the building here simply cross Cali Drive in the\nmiddle of the block and enter the lot through the driveway. There was\na crosswalk in the middle of the block as recently as 2011, but the county\nabandoned the crosswalk, and its markings faded over time.            The\nabandoned crosswalk did not line up with the hospital exit, the concrete\npad, or the parking lot driveway. Instead, the abandoned crosswalk was\nlocated a few feet South of the hospital exit and the concrete pad.\n      From 2008 through 2012, there were several vehicle accidents on\nCali Drive involving pedestrians.       Concerned, HNMC wrote to the\ncounty in 2009, asking it to implement new safety measures on Cali\nDrive. The county conducted a traffic study, undertook some safety\nmeasures, and unilaterally recommended that HNMC take additional\nsafety measures. HNMC did not take the recommended measures.\n      In 2015, after HNMC declined to take the safety measures and\nafter the abandoned crosswalk had mostly faded, Leny Chan was killed\nwhile crossing Cali Drive. A nurse employed by HNMC for more than\n30 years, Chan was leaving work and walking to her car located in the\nHNMC parking lot. She came out of the hospital exit and proceeded to\ncross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, intending to enter the\nparking lot via the driveway.\n\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\f      At the same time, James Budd was beginning to leave the parking\nlot in his car. He reached the driveway, pulled up past the traffic control\nsignage located in the right-of-way to his right, and stopped. He looked\nto his left (South), his right (North), and then looked forward as he began\nto turn left out of the parking lot to proceed South on Cali Drive. Budd\nstruck Chan as he was turning left. Emergency services responded, but\nChan died that evening as a result of her injuries.\n      Chan\u2019s estate and surviving family members (collectively Chan)\nsued Budd and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Budd\u2019s employer.\nSiemens designated HNMC and Harris County as responsible third\nparties, and Chan then added HNMC as a defendant. At the end of trial,\nthe jury was given an ordinary negligence charge and found all parties\nnegligent. The jury apportioned liability as follows: 40% to Budd, 30%\nto Harris County, 20% to HNMC, and 10% to Chan. The trial court\nrendered judgment on the verdict, and Chan settled with Budd and\nSiemens.\n      HNMC appealed, arguing among other things that (1) it owed no\nduty to Chan, (2) Chan failed to obtain a premises liability finding,\n(3) there is no evidence of liability or damages, and (4) any liability is\nbarred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because Chan was an HNMC\nemployee leaving work when she was killed. A panel of the court of\nappeals agreed with the first argument and reversed, holding that\nHNMC had no duty to ensure Chan\u2019s safety while crossing the street\nand rendering a take-nothing judgment.

Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 926. The\nen banc majority noted the general rule that property owners owe no\nduty to make safe public roadways appurtenant to their property and\nidentified four exceptions to that rule. Id. at 929. Instead of applying\nany of these rules, however, the majority recognized a new duty specific\nto this situation by analyzing the factors listed in Greater Houston\nTransportation Co. v. Phillips.     Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 930-36 (citing\nPhillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">801 S.W.2d 523</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (Tex. 1990)). The majority next concluded\nthat HNMC had invited any error regarding the failure to secure a\npremises liability finding and that sufficient evidence supported the\nverdict. Id. at 936-940. And the majority held that HNMC failed to\nassign error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to apply the Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act because HNMC\u2019s appellate brief attacked only the\ndenial of its motion for summary judgment, which is not reviewable on\nappeal following a trial. Id. at 928 (citing Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v.\nCates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">927 S.W.2d 623</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (Tex. 1996)).1\n\n\n\n\n      1 Federal precedent had similarly been against the reviewability of a\n\ndenial of summary judgment, but the Supreme Court of the United States\nrecently held that the denial of summary judgment on purely legal grounds\nmay be challenged on appeal. Dupree v. Younger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">598 U.S. 729</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735-36 (2023).\nBecause we decide this case on duty and evidentiary issues, we have no\noccasion to consider whether Dupree should inform our own standard on the\nreviewability of summary judgment denials.\n\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f                               ANALYSIS\n\n      HNMC raises two issues in its petition for review. First, it argues\nthat it did not owe a duty of reasonable care to Chan while she was\ncrossing Cali Drive. Second, HNMC contends that because Chan was\nleaving her place of employment when she was hit, the Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act bars any liability to HNMC, her employer. Because\nboth issues raise questions of law, we review them de novo. Aleman v.\nTex. Med. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">573 S.W.3d 796</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (Tex. 2019).\n\nI.    HNMC had a limited duty to Chan because it placed a\n      concrete pad, driveway, and signs in the county\n      right-of-way.\n\n      \u201cThe threshold inquiry in a negligence case is duty.\u201d Elephant\nIns. Co., LLC v. Kenyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">644 S.W.3d 137</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 144 (Tex. 2022) (quoting\nPhillips, 801 S.W.2d at 525). Whether a defendant owes a plaintiff a\nduty \u201cis a question of law for the court to decide from the facts\nsurrounding the occurrence in question.\u201d Phillips, 801 S.W.2d at 525.\nBut courts should only consider recognizing a new duty \u201c[w]hen a duty\nhas not been recognized in particular circumstances.\u201d Pagayon v.

If a court has not already decided whether certain\ncircumstances will give rise to a duty, the relevant question is \u201cwhether\na duty should be imposed in a defined class of cases.\u201d Pagayon, 536\nS.W.3d at 504; see also Houston Area Safety Council, Inc. v. Mendez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">671\nS.W.3d 580</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (Tex. 2023).      We therefore begin our analysis by\nconsidering whether certain recognized duty or no-duty rules apply in\nthese circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\f       A.     Because duty rules already address this class of\n              cases, the Phillips factors should not be used to\n              create a duty.\n\n       Relying on authority from other courts of appeals, the en banc\nmajority identified a background no-duty rule and four \u201cexceptions\u201d in\nwhich a premises owner may owe a duty to persons who are not on its\nproperty. Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 929-930. Our Court\u2019s precedent has\ndescribed these rules somewhat differently.\n       The majority correctly articulated a background no-duty rule for\nadjacent streets: \u201ca property owner . . . has no duty to ensure the safety\nof a person who leaves the owner\u2019s property and suffers injury on an\nadjacent public roadway, or to ensure that person\u2019s safety against the\ndangerous acts of a third party.\u201d Id. at 929. As we explain below, this\nrule is supported by our precedent, and it applies to a defined class of\ncases that includes the facts of this case.\n       The en banc majority then opined that this rule \u201cis subject to\ncertain exceptions,\u201d and it cited several of our cases. Id. But most of the\ncases cited do not directly address duties on public roads, so they are not\ntruly exceptions to the background no-duty rule. Rather, they describe\ncertain classes of cases in which we have recognized that a defendant\ncan owe a duty on premises it does not own or occupy. And the parties\nin this case dispute whether the facts here\u2014which do involve a public\nroad\u2014fall within any of these classes.2\n\n\n       2 We confine our analysis to the duty rules addressed by the parties and\n\ndo not attempt to identify an exhaustive list of rules that could inform whether\na duty exists on these facts. See In re City of Lubbock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">666 S.W.3d 546</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2023) (citing United States v.

Ct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       7</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f      The first duty is that owed by a party who \u201cundertakes to make\n[a] premises safe for others.\u201d Wilson v. Tex. Parks &amp; Wildlife Dep\u2019t, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8\nS.W.3d 634</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (Tex. 1999).       The second is the duty owed by a\nlandowner whose land contains a dangerous condition or excavation\nappurtenant to a public highway. See Alamo Nat\u2019l Bank v. Kraus, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">616\nS.W.2d 908</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910 (Tex. 1981). The third is the duty owed by a property\nowner or occupier who assumes actual control of adjacent property. See\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">868 S.W.2d 322</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (Tex. 1993).\nAnd the fourth is the duty owed by a property owner or occupier who\nknows of an obscured danger near the entrance or exit of his property.\nSee Renfro Drug Co. v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">235 S.W.2d 609</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (Tex. 1950). We\ndiscuss each of these duties below.\n      After setting out all of these rules regarding duty, the majority\ndid not analyze their application. Instead, it proceeded to apply the\nfactors listed in Greater Houston Transportation Co. v. Phillips to\ndetermine whether HNMC owed a duty to Chan. See Chan, 637 S.W.3d\nat 930-36. This was error.\n      When a duty or no-duty rule already exists that contemplates a\nparticular case\u2019s factual situation, the balance addressed in Phillips has\nbeen struck. Thus, there is no need to apply the Phillips factors, and\ndoing so is improper. The Phillips factors are inapplicable in cases\nwhere there is a duty rule that takes the factual circumstances at issue\ninto account. See Pagayon, 536 S.W.3d at 503; cf. Mendez, 671 S.W.3d\nat 583-85 (analyzing whether existence of duty \u201cremained an open\n\n\n1575, 1579 (2020)); Pike v. Tex.

And even when there is no\nduty rule, the analysis contemplated in Phillips may only be used to\nidentify a class of cases in which a duty exists, not to craft a duty tailored\nto the unique facts of an individual case. As we have explained, \u201cthe\nfactual situation presented must be evaluated in the broader context of\nsimilarly situated actors. The question is whether a duty should be\nimposed in a defined class of cases, not whether the facts of the case at\nhand show a breach.\u201d Pagayon, 536 S.W.3d at 504.\n       Here, the en banc majority recognized that at least one of the duty\nrules applies to the factual circumstances in this case: a property owner\nor occupier generally owes no duty to make an appurtenant roadway\nsafe for those leaving the property. That recognition alone demonstrates\nthat balancing the Phillips factors is inappropriate. Moreover, as our\nanalysis below makes clear, other rules addressing when a landowner\nowes a duty to persons not on its property can also be applied to help\nanswer the duty question on these facts. For these reasons, the majority\nerred in analyzing duty by balancing the Phillips factors.\n\n       B.     HNMC owed Chan a limited duty because it\n              exercised some control over the adjacent\n              right-of-way.\n\n       Having concluded that the Phillips factors are not a proper\nframework for analyzing the duty question in this case, we next consider\nwhether the various duty rules identified by the court of appeals and\naddressed by the parties give rise to a duty here. We address each rule\nin turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\f              1.      HNMC had no duty to ensure Chan\u2019s safety\n                      while she was crossing an adjacent public\n                      road.\n\n       We first consider the background no-duty rule articulated by the\nen banc majority: \u201ca property owner . . . has no duty to ensure the safety\nof a person who leaves the owner\u2019s property and suffers injury on an\nadjacent public roadway, or to ensure that person\u2019s safety against the\ndangerous acts of a third party.\u201d Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 929.

Thus, we turn to the\nother duty rules identified by the parties.\n\n             2.     HNMC did not agree or contract to make the\n                    road safe for others.\n\n      We next consider the duty that applies when \u201ca person . . . agrees\nor contracts, either expressly or impliedly, to make safe a known,\ndangerous condition of real property.\u201d        Holland v.

Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife\nDepartment, holding that \u201ca party who does not own, occupy, or control\n[the] premises may nevertheless owe a duty of due care if it undertakes\nto make the premises safe for others.\u201d 8 S.W.3d at 635; see also City of\nDenton v. Page, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">701 S.W.2d 831</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834-35 (Tex. 1986). Wilson makes clear\nthat this duty rule springs from the common-law doctrine of negligent\nundertaking, which sounds in ordinary negligence. See 8 S.W.3d at 635\nn.4 (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 323 (Am. L. Inst.\n1965)); see also Kenyon, 644 S.W.3d at 151 (explaining the doctrine).\n      In this case, there is no evidence that HNMC agreed or contracted\nwith anyone to reduce or eliminate the danger of crossing Cali Drive.\nInstead, HNMC reached out to the county\u2014the entity responsible for\nthe safety of the street\u2014and requested that it make changes. By asking\n\n\n\n\n                                   11\n\fa neighboring landowner to make its property safer, the requesting\nparty does not undertake that obligation itself. The record also shows\nthat the county responded in part by unilaterally suggesting that\nHNMC perform certain tasks, but HNMC did not do so.              HNMC\u2019s\ninaction is not an agreement\u2014express or implied\u2014to make crossing\nCali Drive safer. See Nall v.

Accordingly,\nHNMC did not undertake a duty to Chan.\n\n             3.     The artificial conditions HNMC created were\n                    either not on its property or not unreasonably\n                    dangerous.\n\n      Next, we consider the duty of an \u201cowner or occupant of premises\nabutting a highway\u201d to refrain from \u201cjeopardiz[ing] or endanger[ing] the\nsafety of persons using the highway as a means of passage or travel.\u201d\nKraus, 616 S.W.2d at 910.

Although she characterizes certain conditions both on and off\nHNMC\u2019s property as dangerous and asserts that those conditions\ncontributed to the situation that led to Chan\u2019s death, nothing about the\nconditions she identifies was obscured or made those conditions\ndangerous in and of themselves.          See Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 960-61\n(Jewell, J., dissenting). Rather, it was Budd\u2019s careless driving that\nultimately killed Chan, and nothing about that danger was obscured\neither. The risk of injury inherent in crossing any busy street as a\npedestrian is unquestionably open and obvious. HNMC thus owed no\nduty under this rule.\n\nII.      HNMC\u2019s limited duty does not support the judgment.\n\n         Having determined the contours of the duty owed by HNMC, we\nnext consider whether the jury\u2019s finding that HNMC was negligent\nsupports the judgment in Chan\u2019s favor. We conclude that it does not.\nUnder the negligence question submitted to the jury, we hold there is no\nevidence that a dangerous condition controlled by HNMC proximately\ncaused Chan\u2019s death.\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\f      The jury charge.        Before addressing the sufficiency of the\nevidence, we caution that parties should consider carefully whether each\napplicable duty sounds in premises liability or ordinary negligence so\nthat the correct question(s) can be included in the jury charge. We have\nheld in several cases that a jury\u2019s affirmative answer to an ordinary\nnegligence question cannot support a recovery for injury caused by a\npremises defect. E.g., United Scaffolding, Inc. v. Levine, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">537 S.W.3d\n463</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (Tex. 2017). Absent special instructions or definitions, a jury\nquestion regarding negligent activity does not include the essential\nelements of a defendant\u2019s liability for failing to exercise reasonable care\nin warning about or making safe a dangerous premises condition.

The exercise-of-control duty that we have concluded HNMC\nowed sounds in premises liability. In Wal-Mart Stores v. Alexander, we\nheld that a property owner or occupier \u201cis responsible for those areas\nadjacent to the demised premises which it actually controls.\u201d          868\nS.W.2d at 324. In so doing, we cited the Second Restatement\u2019s definition\nof \u201cpossessor of land\u201d for the assertion that a party exercising actual\n\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\fcontrol over land owes premises-type duties in the area it controls.

Accordingly, to hold a defendant\nliable for breaching this duty with respect to defective conditions it\ncontrols, a premises liability question must be submitted to the jury.\n      But in this case, the jury charge included only an ordinary\nnegligence question and instructions. The charge defined negligence as\n\u201cthe failure to use ordinary care\u201d and then asked whether \u201cthe\nnegligence, if any, of [Budd, HNMC, Chan, or Harris County]\nproximately cause[d Chan\u2019s] death.\u201d The charge thus failed to include\nthe essential elements of a premises liability claim.        See United\nScaffolding, 537 S.W.3d at 472 (citing Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">648 S.W.2d 292</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296 (Tex. 1983)).\n      The en banc majority held that HNMC invited any charge error\nby opposing a premises liability submission requested by a different\ndefendant. See Chan, 637 S.W.3d at 937 (citing Del Lago Partners, Inc.\nv. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">307 S.W.3d 762</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (Tex. 2010)). Chief Justice Christopher\ndisagreed in dissent, contending that it was Chan\u2019s obligation to ensure\nthat a charge sufficient for her theory of liability was submitted to the\njury, and HNMC was under no obligation to object to the incorrect\nsubmission. See id. at 950 (Christopher, C.J., dissenting) (citing United\nScaffolding, 537 S.W.3d at 481). Because HNMC has not challenged the\nmajority\u2019s holding about invited error in this Court, we express no view\nregarding whether it was correct.\n\n\n\n\n                                    18\n\f       The evidence. Instead, HNMC argues that the charge required\nproof of breach and proximate cause that Chan failed to provide. Having\nreviewed the record, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that\nthe areas of the public right-of-way controlled by HNMC included\nunreasonably dangerous conditions that proximately caused Chan\u2019s\ndeath. Ultimately, the hazard Chan faced was a careless driver on Cali\nDrive: a hazard for which HNMC was not responsible in an area where\nit had not exercised control.\n       The concrete pad and driveway: The evidence at trial showed\nthat HNMC installed both the concrete pad and the parking lot driveway\nin the public right-of-way on opposite sides of Cali Drive. Chan contends\nthat these features, combined with the location of the hospital exit and\nadjoining stairs on HNMC\u2019s property, \u201cconcentrated\u201d vehicles and\npedestrians into the same area and \u201cfunneled\u201d exiting pedestrians over\nthe public sidewalk and HNMC\u2019s concrete pad, into the public street and\nthrough the county\u2019s abandoned crosswalk, and then across the public\nright-of-way on the other side and into the driveway of HNMC\u2019s parking\nlot.\n       But the record shows that HNMC did not control the abandoned\ncrosswalk, and that the crosswalk did not connect to either the pad or\nthe driveway\u2014it was located to the South of both. In addition, there is\nno evidence that the condition of the pad or the driveway posed an\nunreasonable risk of harm. For example, there were no \u201cfunneling\u201d rails\nor other barriers on the sidewalk or concrete pad that made it\nunreasonably difficult for Chan to access the marked crosswalks at the\nends of the block.\n\n\n\n\n                                   19\n\f      Nor is there any evidence that Budd\u2019s careless driving upon\nexiting the driveway was influenced by the condition of the driveway.\nWhen Chan faced the driver in the street, both she and the driver had\nleft the area of the public right-of-way where HNMC exercised control.\nFor these reasons, no reasonable jury could find that HNMC breached\nits duty regarding a dangerous condition of the pad or driveway in a\nmanner that proximately caused Chan\u2019s death.\n      The signs: Chan also contends that the signs HNMC placed in\nthe right-of-way North of the driveway blocked the view of drivers\nexiting the parking lot. But Budd gave uncontroverted testimony that\nhe pulled up beyond the signs to his right and stopped before observing\nCali Drive in each direction, and that he was looking forward\u2014in the\ndirection his vehicle was moving and away from the signs\u2014when he\nturned left out of the parking lot and struck Chan. Another HNMC\nemployee walking with Chan confirmed that Budd was looking forward\nwhen he hit Chan. The signs to Budd\u2019s right thus did nothing to obscure\nhis view to the left, where he was turning and Chan was crossing. And\nChan\u2019s crossing location was in the street South of the driveway, outside\nthe area where HNMC exercised control. Accordingly, no reasonable\njury could find that the signs HNMC placed in the right-of-way, even if\ndangerous, proximately caused Chan\u2019s death. Because the evidence is\nlegally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of proximate cause\nregarding the signs or its finding of breach regarding the pad or\ndriveway, HNMC is entitled to a take-nothing judgment.

Here, HNMC exercised control over\nlimited areas of the public right-of-way abutting Cali Drive. But Chan\nwas not injured by conditions in the controlled area. Instead, she was\ntragically killed by the careless acts of a third-party driver, a risk for\nwhich HNMC was not responsible and from which it had no duty to\nprotect Chan.   We therefore reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment\naffirming the judgment on the verdict in Chan\u2019s favor, and we render\njudgment that the Chan parties take nothing.        See TEX. R.

Mitchellville\u2019s\n\n        complaint alleged that Hanover wrongfully denied coverage under its insurance policy for\n\n        commercial property damage caused by turkey vultures to the roof of one of Mitchellville\u2019s\n\n        properties. Hanover denied coverage under an exception in the insurance policy which\n\n        excluded coverage for damage caused by an \u201cinfestation\u201d of birds. For the following\n\n        reasons, we affirm.\n\n              We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts\n\n        in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Martin v.

Under\n\n        Pennsylvania law, \u201c[i]ssues of contractual interpretation are questions of law.\u201d Wert v.\n\n        Manorcare of Carlile PA, LLC, 124 A.3d 1248, 1259 (Pa. 2015). The primary goal of\n\n        \u201ccontract interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the contracting parties.\u201d Ins. Adjustment\n\n        Bureau, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 905 A.2d 462, 468 (Pa. 2006). When a contract\u2019s language\n\n        is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthe intent of the parties is to be ascertained from the document\n\n        itself.\u201d Id. In such circumstances, a contract\u2019s language \u201cshall be given its commonly\n\n        accepted and plain meaning.\u201d TruServ Corp. v. Morgan\u2019s Tool & Supply Co., 39 A.3d\n\n        253, 260 (Pa. 2012). Generally, courts \u201cconsult the dictionary definition of a word to\n\n        determine its ordinary usage.\u201d Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. v. Com. Union\n\n        Ins. Co., 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa. 2006). However, when ambiguity exists, \u201cparol evidence\n\n        is admissible to explain or clarify or resolve the ambiguity.\u201d Allstate, 905 A.2d at 468.\n\n        \u201cWhile unambiguous contracts are interpreted by the court as a matter of law, ambiguous\n\n        writings are interpreted by the finder of fact.\u201d Id. at 469.\n\n               \u201c[A] contract is not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not\n\n        agree upon the proper construction.\u201d State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. MacDonald, 850 A.2d\n\n        707, 710 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, a written\n\n        contract is ambiguous \u201conly when a policy provision is reasonably susceptible of more than\n\n                                                       3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-2089        Doc: 19       Filed: 01/19/2024       Pg: 4 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        one meaning.\u201d        Brosovic v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., 841 A.2d 1071, 1073 (Pa.\n\n        Super. Ct. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). When considering the intention of the\n\n        parties in relation to a question of ambiguity, the court must consider the circumstances\n\n        under which the contract was formed. Wert, 124 A.3d at 1259-60. \u201cAny ambiguities shall\n\n        be construed against the contract drafter.\u201d Id. at 1260.\n\n               Based on these principles, we find that the district court did not err in determining\n\n        that the vulture presence on Mitchellville\u2019s property constituted an \u201cinfestation\u201d under a\n\n        plain and ordinary understanding of this term. Indeed, as the district court found, the\n\n        various definitions of the term \u201cinfestation\u201d commonly characterize an infestation as the\n\n        persistent, invasive presence of unwanted creatures in a specific area and in a group large\n\n        enough to be troublesome and destructive. Furthermore, the evidence of the vulture\n\n        activity at the property, including the eyewitness testimony detailing the substantial bird\n\n        activity at the property over the course of many months, meets this definition. Accordingly,\n\n        the district court properly granted summary judgment to Hanover on Mitchellville\u2019s breach\n\n        of contract claim.\n\n               As to Mitchellville\u2019s bad faith claim, Pennsylvania\u2019s bad faith statute, 42 Pa. Cons.\n\n        Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8371, allows a court to award interest, punitive damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees on an insurance claim when a plaintiff presents clear and convincing evidence that an\n\n        insurer \u201cdid not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy\u201d and \u201cknew\n\n        of or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis.\u201d Rancosky v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Ins.\n\n        Co., 170 A.3d 364, 365 (Pa. 2017). This first prong \u201cis an objective inquiry into whether\n\n        a reasonable insurer would have denied payment of the claim under the facts and\n\n                                                     4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-2089       Doc: 19          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 5 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        circumstances presented.\u201d Id. at 374. Under the second prong, \u201cmere negligence is\n\n        insufficient for a finding of bad faith.\u201d Id. And, while \u201can insurer\u2019s motive of self-interest\n\n        or ill-will [is] potentially probative of the second prong, [it] is not a mandatory prerequisite\n\n        to bad faith recovery.\u201d Id. at 377. \u201cRather, proof of the insurer\u2019s knowledge or reckless\n\n        disregard for its lack of reasonable basis in denying the claim is sufficient.\u201d Id.\n\n               Hanover based its denial of policy benefits on several reports that, taken together,\n\n        gave Hanover a reasonable basis for denying coverage, as these reports indicated that\n\n        substantial, persistent, and troublesome bird activity had caused the relevant damage to the\n\n        roof of the property. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting\n\n        summary judgment to Hanover on this claim.\n\n               For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with\n\n        oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the\n\n        materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                                          AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 22-2089      Doc: 19         Filed: 01/19/2024    Pg: 1 of 5\n\n\n\n\n                                            UNPUBLISHED\n\n                               UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                   FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                              No. 22-2089\n\n\n        MITCHELLVILLE PLAZA BAR LP,\n\n                            Plaintiff - Appellant,\n\n                     v.\n\n        THE HANOVER AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                            Defendant - Appellee.\n\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, at Greenbelt.\n        Paul W.

Indeed, as the district court found, the\n\n        various definitions of the term \u201cinfestation\u201d commonly characterize an infestation as the\n\n        persistent, invasive presence of unwanted creatures in a specific area and in a group large\n\n        enough to be troublesome and destructive. Furthermore, the evidence of the vulture\n\n        activity at the property, including the eyewitness testimony detailing the substantial bird\n\n        activity at the property over the course of many months, meets this definition. Accordingly,\n\n        the district court properly granted summary judgment to Hanover on Mitchellville\u2019s breach\n\n        of contract claim.\n\n               As to Mitchellville\u2019s bad faith claim, Pennsylvania\u2019s bad faith statute, 42 Pa.

We consider whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether\n\n        an entity established that it was the corporate employer who had entered into an arbitration\n\n        agreement with its employee. The alleged agreement required, among other things, that\n\n        the employee submit to arbitration any wage-related claims against the employer. The\n\n        district court held that the entity failed to carry its evidentiary burden to establish an\n\n        enforceable agreement compelling arbitration of such claims. After review of the record,\n\n        we vacate the district court\u2019s order and conclude that under Section 4 of the Federal\n\n        Arbitration Act, the court should have conducted a trial to resolve the issue whether the\n\n        parties entered into an enforceable arbitration agreement. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4.\n\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\n               Siobhan James filed a complaint asserting a putative class action against her\n\n        \u201cemployer,\u201d \u201cPRS Partners, LLC, d/b/a Capital Cabaret\u201d (PRS).

PRS submitted\n\n        in support of its motion three exhibits: (1) a copy of James\u2019s United States passport; (2) a\n\n        three-page, signed arbitration agreement (the alleged agreement); and (3) a second set of\n\n        \u201csignatures\u201d on a separate page that referred to an \u201cEntertainer Orientation Packet.\u201d\n\n               The alleged agreement states that it was made \u201cby and between\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d\n\n        and the \u201cEntertainer,\u201d which are identified in the agreement in handwriting as \u201cCap Cab\u201d\n\n        and \u201cS.

See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 66-71.4(a), 66-71.5(a). The court\u2019s\n\n        review of relevant public records did not show that PRS operated under any assumed\n\n        names. The court observed that, instead, a different corporate entity, \u201cRPS Holdings, LLC\u201d\n\n        (RPS), had filed a \u201cCertificate of Assumed Name for a Limited Liability Company\u201d\n\n        indicating that RPS \u201cdoes business under the assumed name Capital Cabaret.\u201d Thus, the\n\n        district court concluded that PRS failed to show that an agreement existed between James\n\n        and PRS, because the record did not demonstrate \u201ca link between PRS and [RPS] or\n\n\n                3\n                    The parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge in the district court.\n\n                                                        4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1027       Doc: 47         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 5 of 11\n\n\n\n\n        between PRS and the assumed name Capital Cabaret (or \u2018Cap Cab\u2019).\u201d After this ruling,\n\n        PRS filed a declaration by Phong Nguyen, a principal in both PRS and RPS, in which he\n\n        stated that (1) PRS serves as a landlord and owns the building where Capital Cabaret is\n\n        located; (2) RPS owns and operates the Capital Cabaret gentlemen\u2019s club, and (3) RPS\n\n        \u201centered into an Arbitration Agreement\u201d with James (the first Nguyen declaration).\n\n               James filed an amended complaint, changing the defendant\u2019s name to RPS \u201cd/b/a\n\n        [doing business as] Capital Cabaret,\u201d as well as an amended motion requesting the court to\n\n        conditionally certify the putative class. RPS filed an opposition to the motion to certify,\n\n        and a renewed motion to compel arbitration, attaching the same three exhibits described\n\n        above, namely, a copy of James\u2019s passport, the alleged agreement, and the additional\n\n        \u201cEntertainer Orientation Packet\u201d signature page. James opposed the renewed motion to\n\n        compel, arguing in relevant part that RPS was not a party to the alleged agreement and had\n\n        not shown a relationship among \u201cCap Cab,\u201d RPS, and RPS\u2019s assumed name of \u201cCapital\n\n        Cabaret.\u201d\n\n               The district court denied RPS\u2019s renewed motion to compel arbitration. The court\n\n        observed that the alleged agreement does not \u201cmention[]\u201d Capital Cabaret or RPS, and that\n\n        the court \u201cexpect[ed] more clarity regarding the identity of the contracting parties.\u201d Similar\n\n        to the court\u2019s initial ruling, the court explained that RPS \u201cfailed to point to anything in the\n\n        record establishing a connection between \u2018Cap Cab\u2019 and RPS.\u201d To the extent that RPS\n\n        argued that \u201cCap Cab\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cCapital Cabaret,\u201d the court held that RPS\n\n        had not supported that argument with evidence or explained how RPS\u2019s identity reasonably\n\n        can be ascertained from the alleged agreement. Finally, the court held that even assuming\n\n                                                      5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1027      Doc: 47          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n        that \u201cCap Cab\u201d was a separate legal entity, RPS failed to show that the unidentified person\n\n        signing the alleged agreement on behalf of \u201cCap Cab\u201d acted as an agent for RPS. 4\n\n               RPS filed a notice of appeal in this Court, divesting the district court of jurisdiction\n\n        over the underlying claims. 5 See Levin v. Alms & Assocs., Inc., 634 F.3d 260, 266 (4th Cir.\n\n        2011). We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA) to review\n\n        on an interlocutory basis the district court\u2019s denial of RPS\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.\n\n        9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(b).\n\n\n\n                                                      II.\n\n               RPS argues that the district court erred in denying its renewed motion to compel\n\n        arbitration. RPS contends that the alleged agreement demonstrates that RPS formed a\n\n        contract with James, because \u201cCap Cab\u201d was a \u201ccommon sense\u201d abbreviation of Capital\n\n        Cabaret, the assumed name of RPS, which is James\u2019s employer. 6 RPS further contends\n\n\n               4\n                 The district court also granted in part James\u2019s motion to conditionally certify a\n        class under \u00a7 216. That ruling is not before us in the current appeal.\n               5\n                  The district court granted RPS\u2019s motion for stay pending appeal, and did not\n        consider RPS\u2019s new argument that the parties entered into an \u201cimplied-in-fact\u201d arbitration\n        agreement or RPS\u2019s newly submitted exhibits including a \u201cbetter,\u201d additional arbitration\n        agreement signed by James with \u201cCapital Cabaret,\u201d arbitration agreements signed by other\n        dancers, and a second, separate declaration by Nguyen. RPS does not rely on these exhibits\n        in this appeal.\n               6\n                 We disagree with RPS\u2019s additional argument that the district court failed to\n        acknowledge that federal public policy favors the arbitration of claims. The FAA policy\n        generally favoring arbitration applies \u201conly when . . . [an] \u2018agreement is ambiguous about\n        whether it covers the dispute at hand.\u2019\u201d Raymond James Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Cary, 709 F.3d\n        382, 386 (4th Cir. 2013).

Based on this asserted failure to make an initial\n\n        showing that the parties agreed to arbitrate certain types of disputes, James contends that\n\n        RPS should not be granted an additional opportunity to present evidence regarding whether\n\n        \u201cCap Cab\u201d was understood by the parties as an abbreviation for \u201cCapital Cabaret.\u201d We\n\n        disagree with James\u2019s arguments.\n\n               We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel arbitration.\n\n        Rowland v.

The alleged agreement further states that it covers\n\n        certain categories of claims, including the types of claims in which James presently alleges\n\n        that she is the \u201cemployee\u201d of \u201cCapital Cabaret.\u201d Upon reviewing the language of the\n\n        alleged agreement, along with James\u2019s allegations that her employer was RPS, which\n\n        operated a club under its assumed name \u201cCapital Cabaret,\u201d and RPS\u2019s submission in the\n\n        first Nguyen declaration that it entered into an arbitration agreement with James, we\n\n        conclude that this record was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact whether\n\n        \u201cCap Cab\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cCapital Cabaret.\u201d\n\n               Our conclusion is not affected by the district court\u2019s additional finding that RPS\n\n        failed to show that the unidentified person who signed the agreement for \u201cCap Cab\u201d acted\n\n        as an agent for RPS. A factfinder drawing from the present record could conclude that\n\n        RPS proffered the agreement to James, that James signed the agreement, and that RPS\n\n        \u201cimplicitly agreed to be mutually bound\u201d by the agreement. See Howard v.

We consider whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether\n\n        an entity established that it was the corporate employer who had entered into an arbitration\n\n        agreement with its employee. The alleged agreement required, among other things, that\n\n        the employee submit to arbitration any wage-related claims against the employer. The\n\n        district court held that the entity failed to carry its evidentiary burden to establish an\n\n        enforceable agreement compelling arbitration of such claims.

The court\u2019s\n\n        review of relevant public records did not show that PRS operated under any assumed\n\n        names. The court observed that, instead, a different corporate entity, \u201cRPS Holdings, LLC\u201d\n\n        (RPS), had filed a \u201cCertificate of Assumed Name for a Limited Liability Company\u201d\n\n        indicating that RPS \u201cdoes business under the assumed name Capital Cabaret.\u201d Thus, the\n\n        district court concluded that PRS failed to show that an agreement existed between James\n\n        and PRS, because the record did not demonstrate \u201ca link between PRS and [RPS] or\n\n\n                3\n                    The parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge in the district court.\n\n                                                        4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1027       Doc: 47         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 5 of 11\n\n\n\n\n        between PRS and the assumed name Capital Cabaret (or \u2018Cap Cab\u2019).\u201d After this ruling,\n\n        PRS filed a declaration by Phong Nguyen, a principal in both PRS and RPS, in which he\n\n        stated that (1) PRS serves as a landlord and owns the building where Capital Cabaret is\n\n        located; (2) RPS owns and operates the Capital Cabaret gentlemen\u2019s club, and (3) RPS\n\n        \u201centered into an Arbitration Agreement\u201d with James (the first Nguyen declaration).\n\n               James filed an amended complaint, changing the defendant\u2019s name to RPS \u201cd/b/a\n\n        [doing business as] Capital Cabaret,\u201d as well as an amended motion requesting the court to\n\n        conditionally certify the putative class.

James opposed the renewed motion to\n\n        compel, arguing in relevant part that RPS was not a party to the alleged agreement and had\n\n        not shown a relationship among \u201cCap Cab,\u201d RPS, and RPS\u2019s assumed name of \u201cCapital\n\n        Cabaret.\u201d\n\n               The district court denied RPS\u2019s renewed motion to compel arbitration. The court\n\n        observed that the alleged agreement does not \u201cmention[]\u201d Capital Cabaret or RPS, and that\n\n        the court \u201cexpect[ed] more clarity regarding the identity of the contracting parties.\u201d Similar\n\n        to the court\u2019s initial ruling, the court explained that RPS \u201cfailed to point to anything in the\n\n        record establishing a connection between \u2018Cap Cab\u2019 and RPS.\u201d To the extent that RPS\n\n        argued that \u201cCap Cab\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cCapital Cabaret,\u201d the court held that RPS\n\n        had not supported that argument with evidence or explained how RPS\u2019s identity reasonably\n\n        can be ascertained from the alleged agreement. Finally, the court held that even assuming\n\n                                                      5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1027      Doc: 47          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n        that \u201cCap Cab\u201d was a separate legal entity, RPS failed to show that the unidentified person\n\n        signing the alleged agreement on behalf of \u201cCap Cab\u201d acted as an agent for RPS. 4\n\n               RPS filed a notice of appeal in this Court, divesting the district court of jurisdiction\n\n        over the underlying claims. 5 See Levin v.

The alleged agreement further states that it covers\n\n        certain categories of claims, including the types of claims in which James presently alleges\n\n        that she is the \u201cemployee\u201d of \u201cCapital Cabaret.\u201d Upon reviewing the language of the\n\n        alleged agreement, along with James\u2019s allegations that her employer was RPS, which\n\n        operated a club under its assumed name \u201cCapital Cabaret,\u201d and RPS\u2019s submission in the\n\n        first Nguyen declaration that it entered into an arbitration agreement with James, we\n\n        conclude that this record was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact whether\n\n        \u201cCap Cab\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cCapital Cabaret.\u201d\n\n               Our conclusion is not affected by the district court\u2019s additional finding that RPS\n\n        failed to show that the unidentified person who signed the agreement for \u201cCap Cab\u201d acted\n\n        as an agent for RPS. A factfinder drawing from the present record could conclude that\n\n        RPS proffered the agreement to James, that James signed the agreement, and that RPS\n\n        \u201cimplicitly agreed to be mutually bound\u201d by the agreement.

When initially sentencing Newby, the district court included\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release in its written judgment that were not orally\n\n        announced during the sentencing hearing. That was error. See United States v. Rogers,\n\n        961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020). Years later, the district court modified Newby\u2019s sentence\n\n        under the First Step Act of 2018, and the court\u2019s amended judgment purported to \u201ccarr[y]\n\n        forward\u201d those same conditions. JA 171. Newby appeals, urging this Court to remand for\n\n        another round of sentencing. We conclude that, in the specific posture of this case, Newby\u2019s\n\n        challenges are properly before us. On the merits, we vacate Newby\u2019s sentence and remand\n\n        for a full resentencing.\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                 In 2008, Newby was convicted of six non-violent drug crimes. On top of 425 months\n\n        of imprisonment, his sentence included a 10-year term of supervised release.\n\n                 During the post-trial sentencing hearing, the district court announced various\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release. In its written judgment memorializing that\n\n        sentence, however, the court purported to add several more such conditions. Newby\n\n        appealed his sentence on grounds unrelated to this proceeding, which were rejected in an\n\n        unpublished per curiam opinion. See United States v. Newby, 403 Fed. Appx. 809 (4th Cir.\n\n        2010).\n\n                 Almost a decade later, Newby filed a pro se motion seeking a sentence reduction\n\n        under the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5222. The district court\n\n                                                     3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 4 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        appointed counsel and ordered a revised presentence investigation report.\n\n               Newby objected to the new report\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, identifying an error\n\n        in how the original judgment described one of his offenses of conviction. The district court\n\n        concluded the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d was to correct the clerical error under Federal Rule of\n\n        Criminal Procedure 36. JA 169. After doing so, the court\u2014applying the First Step Act\u2014\n\n        adjusted Newby\u2019s Guidelines range and reduced his sentence to 294 months in prison and\n\n        four years of supervised release. The court\u2019s resentencing order concluded: \u201cExcept as\n\n        expressly modified herein, the amended judgment carries forward all terms of \u201d the\n\n        previous one. JA 171. The amended judgment contains the same discretionary conditions\n\n        of supervised release that were not announced orally at Newby\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\n        Newby appeals, arguing that those conditions are improper and that we should vacate and\n\n        remand for resentencing.\n\n                                                    II.\n\n               This case presents a recurring question in a unique posture. In United States v.\n\n        Rogers, 961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020), this Court held a district court may not impose\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release in a written judgment if the court did not\n\n        announce those conditions during the sentencing hearing. This rule, we explained, stems\n\n        from a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201cright to be present when he is sentenced\u201d and the principle\n\n        that \u201cif a conflict arises between the orally pronounced sentence and the written judgment,\n\n        then the oral sentence controls.\u201d Id. at 296. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, discretionary\n\n        conditions announced for the first time in a written judgment are legal \u201cnullities\u201d to which\n\n        the defendant \u201chas never been sentenced.\u201d United States v. Singletary, 984 F.3d 341, 344\u2013\n\n                                                     4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 5 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        45 (4th Cir. 2021) (quotation marks removed).\n\n               Were this an appeal from the initial sentencing decision, this case would be easy.\n\n        The government never denies the district court violated the rule announced in Rogers\u2014\n\n        which, to be fair, was decided more than a decade after Newby\u2019s original sentencing. Nor\n\n        would Newby\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the district court pose a problem were this\n\n        an appeal from the original judgment. See United States v. Cisson, 33 F.4th 185, 192\u201393\n\n        (4th Cir. 2022) (rejecting application of plain-error standard in that context); Rogers,\n\n        961 F.3d at 295\u201396 (same). In that situation, our path would be clear: We would vacate\n\n        Newby\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. See Singletary, 984 F.3d at 346; Rogers,\n\n        961 F.3d at 300\u201301.\n\n               The problem, of course, is that this is not an appeal from Newby\u2019s original sentence.\n\n        That appeal has been taken and lost, see 403 Fed. Appx. 809 (4th Cir. 2010), and Newby\n\n        identifies no basis for reopening it. Cf. United States v. Brantley, No. 22-4166, 2023 WL\n\n        8215209, at *1 (4th Cir. Nov. 28, 2023) (\u201cdefendants who raise Rogers errors are\u201d not\n\n        \u201cexcused from the usual timeliness rules for filing a notice of appeal\u201d). Nor, as Newby\n\n        conceded at oral argument, is there any freestanding right to ask an appellate court to\n\n        correct even the most obvious Rogers error. See Oral Arg. 14:14\u201314:41; accord Brantley,\n\n        2023 WL 8215209, at *3 (emphasizing that \u201c[a] judgment with a Rogers error, just as any\n\n        other judgment, is valid until corrected on appeal or amended by the district court\u201d). For\n\n        those reasons, our hands are tied unless Newby has a procedurally appropriate mechanism\n\n        for raising the issue now. Fortunately for him, we believe he does.\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018       Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 6 of 12\n\n\n\n\n               The order from which Newby currently appeals did two things: It corrected a clerical\n\n        error in the original judgment and modified Newby\u2019s sentence under the First Step Act. All\n\n        parties agree we have jurisdiction to review that order. See Manrique v. United States,\n\n        581 U.S. 116, 121\u201322 (2017) (emphasizing that an amended criminal judgment is a\n\n        separate appealable order). Exercising that jurisdiction here, we vacate and remand for\n\n        resentencing because the district court\u2019s amended judgment remains infected by the initial\n\n        Rogers error.\n\n               True, this Court\u2019s holding in Rogers was based in part on Federal Rule of Criminal\n\n        Procedure 43. And true, that provision specifically excludes from its ambit \u201cproceeding[s]\n\n        involv[ing] the . . . reduction of [a] sentence under . . . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c),\u201d the statutory\n\n        provision under which First Step Act resentencing occurs. Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(4);\n\n        see United States v. Chambers, 956 F.3d 667, 671 (4th Cir. 2020) (describing First Step\n\n        Act motions as \u201cfall[ing] under \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B)). But that only matters if the First Step Act\n\n        authorizes district courts to impose new discretionary conditions of supervised release.\n\n               It does not. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, the terms of Newby\u2019s supervised release\n\n        are part of his \u201cone unified sentence.\u201d Singletary, 984 F.3d at 346 n.4 (quotation marks\n\n        removed). And the only type of modified \u201csentence\u201d the First Step Act authorizes a district\n\n        court to impose is a \u201creduced\u201d one, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5194. For that\n\n        reason, the district court could not have imposed any new discretionary conditions of\n\n        supervised release in Newby\u2019s First Step Act proceeding.\n\n               From there, we return to the place we began: Rogers. Newby is a criminal defendant\n\n        who has timely appealed his current sentence to this Court. Cf. Brantley, 2023 WL\n\n                                                      6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 7 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        8215209, at *1 (dismissing appeal from a Rogers error where the notice of appeal was filed\n\n        after the relevant deadline). The written judgment from which Newby appeals provides\n\n        that, following his release from incarceration, Newby will be subject to discretionary\n\n        conditions of supervised release never announced in his presence. That is the very defect\n\n        identified in Rogers. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, such conditions are \u201cnullities\u201d to which\n\n        Newby \u201chas never been sentenced.\u201d Singletary, 984 F.3d at 344\u201345. And because the\n\n        conditions were \u201cnever imposed\u201d in the first place (id. at 346) they could not be \u201ccarrie[d]\n\n        forward\u201d (JA 171) through the district court\u2019s amended judgment. We thus vacate the\n\n        amended judgment and remand for resentencing. See United States v. Kemp, No. 21-485,\n\n        slip op. at 13 (4th Cir. 2023) (noting this Court has \u201cidentified a clear rule for remedying\n\n        Rogers errors\u201d and does \u201cnot simply strike the unpronounced conditions\u201d (quotation marks\n\n        removed)). *\n\n                                              *      *      *\n\n               As both sides put it at oral argument, this case may well be a unicorn. Not only is\n\n        our holding based on the \u201cunusual\u201d nature of Rogers errors, see Singletary, 984 F.3d at 345\n\n        (quotation marks removed), it also depends on the unique posture of an appeal from a First\n\n        Step Act resentencing\u2014itself an increasingly uncommon occurrence. Under these\n\n\n\n\n               *\n                 We need not resolve whether Newby\u2019s current claim should have been reviewed\n        only for plain error because he never raised it before the district court in connection with\n        the First Step Act proceedings. By making no such argument in its brief, the government\n        has forfeited any such forfeiture argument. See Jordan v. Large, 27 F.4th 308, 312 n.4\n        (4th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[T]he waiver itself has been waived.\u201d); accord Solomon v. Vilsack, 763\n        F.3d 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining parties can \u201cforfeit[ ] forfeiture arguments.\u201d).\n                                                     7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018     Doc: 49        Filed: 01/19/2024   Pg: 8 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        circumstances, we conclude Newby is entitled to the remedy our decisions provide. We\n\n        thus vacate Newby\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                                                             SO ORDERED\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018       Doc: 49          Filed: 01/19/2024       Pg: 9 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n                Our peculiar approach to Rogers-Singletary 1 errors continues. Fifteen years ago,\n\n        Newby was sentenced for various drug crimes. His original judgment contained two\n\n        discretionary supervised release conditions that were not mentioned at his sentencing\u2014\n\n        what we now sometimes call a Rogers-Singletary error. But this is not a new error. At the\n\n        time of Newby\u2019s sentencing, our circuit had long concluded that in the event of a\n\n        discrepancy between the written judgment and the sentencing court\u2019s oral pronouncement,\n\n        the oral pronouncement prevails. See United States v. Morse, 344 F.2d 27, 31 n.1 (4th Cir.\n\n        1965) (\u201cTo the extent of any conflict between this written order and the oral sentence, the\n\n        latter is controlling.\u201d). And we determined that in such a situation, the district court should\n\n        conform the written judgment to the oral pronouncement. Id. Despite that longstanding\n\n        precedent, Newby did not object before the district court or raise this issue on direct appeal.\n\n        Instead, he appealed on other grounds and we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. See\n\n        United States v. Newby, 403 F. App\u2019x 809, 811 (4th Cir. 2010).\n\n               Almost a decade later, Newby sought to decrease his sentence under the First Step\n\n        Act. In his First Step Act motion, he only sought to reduce the length of his imprisonment\n\n        and supervised release. He said nothing about any discrepancy between his written\n\n        supervised release conditions and those announced at his original sentencing. Consistent\n\n        with that, the district court, in addition to correcting an unrelated clerical error on the listed\n\n        conviction, reduced his prison and supervised release terms.\n\n\n               1\n                United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020); United States v. Singletary,\n        984 F.3d 341, 344 (4th Cir. 2021).\n                                                        9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018       Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 10 of 12\n\n\n\n\n               Newby appealed the judgment resulting from his successful First Step Act motion.\n\n        But he did not challenge any of the district court\u2019s rulings on his motion. Instead, he raised\n\n        for the very first time the discrepancy between the oral pronouncement at his original\n\n        sentencing hearing and the written judgment\u2019s supervised release conditions, which dated\n\n        back to his original sentence fifteen years ago and were merely carried forward in the\n\n        amended judgment. Newby claims he can challenge that discrepancy because, although not\n\n        new, the unannounced terms of his supervised release are restated in the amended\n\n        judgment.\n\n               But I don\u2019t see the procedural basis for the appeal. The deadline for appealing\n\n        Newby\u2019s original judgment\u2014where the Rogers-Singletary error first appeared\u2014passed\n\n        decades ago. And whether under the law of the case doctrine, the mandate rule or waiver\n\n        principles, a party generally cannot use a second appeal to challenge issues that were\n\n        available but not raised in an initial appeal. See Doe v. Chao, 511 F.3d 451, 465 (4th Cir.\n\n        2007); Omni Outdoor Advert., Inc. v. Columbia Outdoor Advert., Inc., 974 F.2d 502, 505\u2013\n\n        06 (4th Cir. 1992). What\u2019s more, as the majority and Newby note, there is no free-standing\n\n        right to ask an appellate court to correct Rogers-Singletary errors. True, if the error here\n\n        were clerical in nature, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 generally permits the\n\n        correction of such errors at any time. However, the majority rightfully does not frame the\n\n        Rogers-Singletary error as clerical. 2\n\n\n               2\n                 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) may provide a way to address a Rogers-\n        Singletary problem. It permits a district the court to correct a \u201cclear error.\u201d Fed. R. Crim.\n        P. 35(a). But that rule has a 14-day deadline. Id. Newby did not invoke Rule 35(a) before\n        the district court.\n                                                     10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018       Doc: 49          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 11 of 12\n\n\n\n\n               The majority permits the appeal under the unique circumstances presented here.\n\n        Those unique circumstances, according to the majority, are that we have jurisdiction to\n\n        review the district court\u2019s recent order on Newby\u2019s First Step Act motion and that the\n\n        amended judgment resulting from that motion carried forward the unannounced supervised\n\n        release conditions first included in the 2008 written judgment. But even considering those\n\n        circumstances, there are only two possible ways I see to reach this result. One, we could\n\n        adopt a rule that any aspect of a judgment resulting from a First Step Act motion can be\n\n        appealed, even if that aspect was not the subject of the motion and had been in place for\n\n        years. That, however, would be a dramatic afront to the finality of judgments. See Calderon\n\n        v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 554 (1998) (recognizing an enduring respect for finality of\n\n        convictions and that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both the retributive and the deterrent functions\n\n        of criminal law\u201d); see also Telcy v. United States, 20 F.4th 735, 745 (11th Cir. 2021)\n\n        (recognizing that a sentence reduction under the First Step Act does not constitute a new\n\n        judgment for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\u2019s bar\n\n        on second or successive habeas petitions). For good reason, the majority does not even\n\n        suggest that should be our rule.\n\n               Two, we could decide that Rogers-Singletary errors, for some reason, require a\n\n        special rule that permits appellate review whenever the error is raised by a criminal\n\n        defendant. Recently, I described my concerns about our Rogers-Singletary jurisprudence.\n\n        United States v. Kemp, No. 21-4185, 2023 WL 8613495, at *6 (4th Cir. Dec. 13, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n                                                       11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 12 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        (Quattlebaum, J., concurring). 3 Adopting such a special rule for this type of error would\n\n        only add to the concerns mentioned there. But fortunately, the majority doesn\u2019t seem to\n\n        adopt that approach either.\n\n               So, if we are not going to adopt either of those two rules\u2014and I agree that we\n\n        shouldn\u2019t\u2014I am left wondering how we can consider this appeal. Since I can find no proper\n\n        basis to do so, with respect for my colleagues in the majority, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  Also, as I recently explained in Kemp, a full resentencing is ill-advised. A more\n        appropriate approach, in my view, would be to \u201cremand for a limited resentencing\u2014giving\n        district courts the choice of whether to vacate problematic conditions or to orally pronounce\n        any unannounced condition.\u201d Id. at *10. But I agree with the majority that Rogers,\n        Singletary and other cases compel a full resentencing. So, despite my disagreement, I am\n        bound on this point.\n\n                                                     12\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 1 of 12\n\n\n\n\n                                              PUBLISHED\n\n                               UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                   FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                               No. 21-4018\n\n\n        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                             Plaintiff \u2013 Appellee,\n\n                      v.\n\n        MARTREY ANTWAIN NEWBY, a/k/a Trey,\n\n                             Defendant \u2013 Appellant.\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, at\n        Greenville.

When initially sentencing Newby, the district court included\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release in its written judgment that were not orally\n\n        announced during the sentencing hearing. That was error. See United States v. Rogers,\n\n        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">961 F.3d 291</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2020). Years later, the district court modified Newby\u2019s sentence\n\n        under the First Step Act of 2018, and the court\u2019s amended judgment purported to \u201ccarr[y]\n\n        forward\u201d those same conditions. JA 171. Newby appeals, urging this Court to remand for\n\n        another round of sentencing. We conclude that, in the specific posture of this case, Newby\u2019s\n\n        challenges are properly before us. On the merits, we vacate Newby\u2019s sentence and remand\n\n        for a full resentencing.\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                 In 2008, Newby was convicted of six non-violent drug crimes. On top of 425 months\n\n        of imprisonment, his sentence included a 10-year term of supervised release.\n\n                 During the post-trial sentencing hearing, the district court announced various\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release. In its written judgment memorializing that\n\n        sentence, however, the court purported to add several more such conditions. Newby\n\n        appealed his sentence on grounds unrelated to this proceeding, which were rejected in an\n\n        unpublished per curiam opinion. See United States v. Newby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">403 Fed. Appx. 809</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.\n\n        2010).\n\n                 Almost a decade later, Newby filed a pro se motion seeking a sentence reduction\n\n        under the First Step Act, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">132 Stat. 5222</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The district court\n\n                                                     3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 4 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        appointed counsel and ordered a revised presentence investigation report.\n\n               Newby objected to the new report\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, identifying an error\n\n        in how the original judgment described one of his offenses of conviction. The district court\n\n        concluded the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d was to correct the clerical error under Federal Rule of\n\n        Criminal Procedure 36. JA 169. After doing so, the court\u2014applying the First Step Act\u2014\n\n        adjusted Newby\u2019s Guidelines range and reduced his sentence to 294 months in prison and\n\n        four years of supervised release. The court\u2019s resentencing order concluded: \u201cExcept as\n\n        expressly modified herein, the amended judgment carries forward all terms of \u201d the\n\n        previous one. JA 171. The amended judgment contains the same discretionary conditions\n\n        of supervised release that were not announced orally at Newby\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\n        Newby appeals, arguing that those conditions are improper and that we should vacate and\n\n        remand for resentencing.\n\n                                                    II.\n\n               This case presents a recurring question in a unique posture. In United States v.\n\n        Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">961 F.3d 291</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2020), this Court held a district court may not impose\n\n        discretionary conditions of supervised release in a written judgment if the court did not\n\n        announce those conditions during the sentencing hearing. This rule, we explained, stems\n\n        from a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201cright to be present when he is sentenced\u201d and the principle\n\n        that \u201cif a conflict arises between the orally pronounced sentence and the written judgment,\n\n        then the oral sentence controls.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 296</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, discretionary\n\n        conditions announced for the first time in a written judgment are legal \u201cnullities\u201d to which\n\n        the defendant \u201chas never been sentenced.\u201d United States v.

Nor\n\n        would Newby\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the district court pose a problem were this\n\n        an appeal from the original judgment. See United States v.

For that\n\n        reason, the district court could not have imposed any new discretionary conditions of\n\n        supervised release in Newby\u2019s First Step Act proceeding.\n\n               From there, we return to the place we began: Rogers. Newby is a criminal defendant\n\n        who has timely appealed his current sentence to this Court. Cf. Brantley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL\n\n     </span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                 6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018      Doc: 49         Filed: 01/19/2024     Pg: 7 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        8215209, at *1 (dismissing appeal from a Rogers error where the notice of appeal was filed\n\n        after the relevant deadline). The written judgment from which Newby appeals provides\n\n        that, following his release from incarceration, Newby will be subject to discretionary\n\n        conditions of supervised release never announced in his presence. That is the very defect\n\n        identified in Rogers. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, such conditions are \u201cnullities\u201d to which\n\n        Newby \u201chas never been sentenced.\u201d Singletary, 984 F.3d at 344\u201345.

We thus vacate the\n\n        amended judgment and remand for resentencing. See United States v.

Fifteen years ago,\n\n        Newby was sentenced for various drug crimes. His original judgment contained two\n\n        discretionary supervised release conditions that were not mentioned at his sentencing\u2014\n\n        what we now sometimes call a Rogers-Singletary error. But this is not a new error. At the\n\n        time of Newby\u2019s sentencing, our circuit had long concluded that in the event of a\n\n        discrepancy between the written judgment and the sentencing court\u2019s oral pronouncement,\n\n        the oral pronouncement prevails. See United States v. Morse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"267519\"><a href=\"/opinion/267519/united-states-v-wayne-francis-morse/\">344 F.2d 27</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 n.1 (4th Cir.\n\n        1965) (\u201cTo the extent of any conflict between this written order and the oral sentence, the\n\n        latter is controlling.\u201d). And we determined that in such a situation, the district court should\n\n        conform the written judgment to the oral pronouncement. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"267519\"><a href=\"/opinion/267519/united-states-v-wayne-francis-morse/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Despite that longstanding\n\n        precedent, Newby did not object before the district court or raise this issue on direct appeal.\n\n        Instead, he appealed on other grounds and we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. See\n\n        United States v. Newby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">403 F. App\u2019x 809</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (4th Cir. 2010).\n\n               Almost a decade later, Newby sought to decrease his sentence under the First Step\n\n        Act. In his First Step Act motion, he only sought to reduce the length of his imprisonment\n\n        and supervised release. He said nothing about any discrepancy between his written\n\n        supervised release conditions and those announced at his original sentencing. Consistent\n\n        with that, the district court, in addition to correcting an unrelated clerical error on the listed\n\n        conviction, reduced his prison and supervised release terms.\n\n\n               1\n                United States v. Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">961 F.3d 291</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2020); United States v.

Instead, he raised\n\n        for the very first time the discrepancy between the oral pronouncement at his original\n\n        sentencing hearing and the written judgment\u2019s supervised release conditions, which dated\n\n        back to his original sentence fifteen years ago and were merely carried forward in the\n\n        amended judgment. Newby claims he can challenge that discrepancy because, although not\n\n        new, the unannounced terms of his supervised release are restated in the amended\n\n        judgment.\n\n               But I don\u2019t see the procedural basis for the appeal. The deadline for appealing\n\n        Newby\u2019s original judgment\u2014where the Rogers-Singletary error first appeared\u2014passed\n\n        decades ago. And whether under the law of the case doctrine, the mandate rule or waiver\n\n        principles, a party generally cannot use a second appeal to challenge issues that were\n\n        available but not raised in an initial appeal. See Doe v. Chao, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">511 F.3d 451</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (4th Cir.\n\n        2007); Omni Outdoor Advert., Inc. v.

What\u2019s more, as the majority and Newby note, there is no free-standing\n\n        right to ask an appellate court to correct Rogers-Singletary errors. True, if the error here\n\n        were clerical in nature, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 generally permits the\n\n        correction of such errors at any time. However, the majority rightfully does not frame the\n\n        Rogers-Singletary error as clerical. 2\n\n\n               2\n                 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) may provide a way to address a Rogers-\n        Singletary problem. It permits a district the court to correct a \u201cclear error.\u201d Fed. R. Crim.\n        P. 35(a). But that rule has a 14-day deadline. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590240\"><a href=\"/opinion/590240/omni-outdoor-advertising-inc-v-columbia-outdoor-advertising-inc-j/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Newby did not invoke Rule 35(a) before\n        the district court.\n                                                     10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4018       Doc: 49          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 11 of 12\n\n\n\n\n               The majority permits the appeal under the unique circumstances presented here.\n\n        Those unique circumstances, according to the majority, are that we have jurisdiction to\n\n        review the district court\u2019s recent order on Newby\u2019s First Step Act motion and that the\n\n        amended judgment resulting from that motion carried forward the unannounced supervised\n\n        release conditions first included in the 2008 written judgment. But even considering those\n\n        circumstances, there are only two possible ways I see to reach this result. One, we could\n\n        adopt a rule that any aspect of a judgment resulting from a First Step Act motion can be\n\n        appealed, even if that aspect was not the subject of the motion and had been in place for\n\n        years. That, however, would be a dramatic afront to the finality of judgments. See Calderon\n\n        v. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Thompson, 523</span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S. 538, 554 (1998) (recognizing an enduring respect for finality of\n\n        convictions and that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both the retributive and the deterrent functions\n\n        of criminal law\u201d); see also Telcy v.

For good reason, the majority does not even\n\n        suggest that should be our rule.\n\n               Two, we could decide that Rogers-Singletary errors, for some reason, require a\n\n        special rule that permits appellate review whenever the error is raised by a criminal\n\n        defendant. Recently, I described my concerns about our Rogers-Singletary jurisprudence.\n\n        United States v. Kemp, No. 21-4185, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL 8613495</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (4th Cir.

But fortunately, the majority doesn\u2019t seem to\n\n        adopt that approach either.\n\n               So, if we are not going to adopt either of those two rules\u2014and I agree that we\n\n        shouldn\u2019t\u2014I am left wondering how we can consider this appeal. Since I can find no proper\n\n        basis to do so, with respect for my colleagues in the majority, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  Also, as I recently explained in Kemp, a full resentencing is ill-advised. A more\n        appropriate approach, in my view, would be to \u201cremand for a limited resentencing\u2014giving\n        district courts the choice of whether to vacate problematic conditions or to orally pronounce\n        any unannounced condition.\u201d Id. at *10. But I agree with the majority that Rogers,\n        Singletary and other cases compel a full resentencing.

Boroughs, United States Attorney,\n        Jonathan Scott Matthews, Assistant United States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED\n        STATES ATTORNEY, Columbia, South Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\n        Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4338         Doc: 24          Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 2 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        PER CURIAM:\n\n                  Montello Marquette Hood appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his\n\n        supervised release and sentencing him to time served. Finding no reversible error, we\n\n        affirm.\n\n                  To revoke supervised release, a district court need only find a violation of\n\n        supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). \u201cWe\n\n        review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a revocation of supervised release for\n\n        clear error and its ultimate decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for abuse of\n\n        discretion.\u201d United States v. Cohen, 63 F.4th 250, 254 (4th Cir.) (cleaned up), cert. denied,\n\n        144 S. Ct. 165 (2023). When revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release, a district court\n\n        must \u201cadequately demonstrate for us the evidence on which it relied . . . so that we may\n\n        understand its reasons for revoking supervised release.\u201d United States v. Patterson, 957\n\n        F.3d 426, 434 (4th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). A district court need not issue a written\n\n        decision so long as \u201cthe transcript and record compiled before the trial judge enable the\n\n        reviewing court to determine the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. at 433 (internal\n\n        quotation marks omitted).\n\n                  Hood first contends that the district court\u2019s factual findings are insufficient to allow\n\n        meaningful appellate review. While the court\u2019s ruling may have been imprecise, it is\n\n        adequate for our consideration. We believe there are two plausible ways to interpret the\n\n        district court\u2019s ruling. First, it could have considered the two assessments at Catawba Area\n\n        Mental Health Center (\u201cCatawba\u201d) to be one incident and thus was referring to that and\n\n        Hood\u2019s failure to attend an appointment at Three Trees Center for Change (\u201cThree Trees\u201d).\n\n                                                         2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4338       Doc: 24         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 3 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        Second, the court could have discounted the Three Trees incident and thus was referring\n\n        solely to the two Catawba assessments. These incidents were close in time, and all were\n\n        discussed at the two hearings. And while the district court\u2019s ruling at the end of the second\n\n        hearing was brief, the court was engaged throughout the two hearings, listening to Hood,\n\n        responding to Hood\u2019s claims, informing Hood when the court had issues with his\n\n        assertions, and attempting to accommodate Hood\u2019s legitimate concerns. Thus, we have an\n\n        adequate record to review.\n\n               Relying on Cohen, Hood next argues that the district court erred in revoking his\n\n        supervised release because he did not fail to participate in treatment and that the district\n\n        court impermissibly conflated participation with perfect compliance. In Cohen, we held\n\n        that a district court erred in finding that the defendant \u201cviolated the condition requiring him\n\n        to participate in a sex offender treatment program by failing to follow the rules of that\n\n        program.\u201d 63 F.4th at 254 (internal quotation marks omitted). While we recognized \u201cthat\n\n        at some point noncompliance with rules may become so frequent or severe as to preclude\n\n        further participation,\u201d we emphasized that \u201cthe treatment provider itself did not consider\n\n        [the] rules violation to be disqualifying.\u201d Id. at 255.\n\n               Here, by contrast, the staff at Catawba found Hood\u2019s conduct to preclude further\n\n        participation, twice instructing him to leave his initial assessment. While Hood selects\n\n        portions of the record where the district court agreed with some of his concerns, it is clear\n\n        by the end of the second hearing that the district court did not find Hood credible. The\n\n        district court sought to mollify Hood\u2019s concern about signing Catawba\u2019s terms without\n\n        reviewing them, but Hood then shifted into arguing that he did not need treatment. When\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4338      Doc: 24         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 4 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        the district court noted Hood had shifted his position, Hood went into a lengthy discussion\n\n        of his understanding of \u201ctreatment\u201d versus \u201ccounseling.\u201d As the parties began discussing\n\n        Hood\u2019s employment, Hood made bizarre claims that he had slept with Queen Elizabeth,\n\n        had smoked marijuana with President Obama, and had donated $30,000 to then-candidate\n\n        Obama\u2019s campaign. Hood then brought up concerns about transportation and giving his\n\n        employer sufficient notice for his appointment at Three Trees, but he refused to commit to\n\n        attending sessions when the district court tried to address these concerns.\n\n               Hood\u2019s behavior did not improve at the second hearing. When the district court\n\n        asked Hood if he admitted or denied the probation officer\u2019s allegations, Hood repeated his\n\n        claims about transportation and notice at Three Trees and brought up the fact that he could\n\n        not afford treatment. The district court twice asked Hood if he would consent to treatment\n\n        if the Government would pay for it, and both times Hood went into a lengthy discussion of\n\n        other considerations. After observing Hood\u2019s demeanor and listening to Hood over the\n\n        course of two hearings, the district court found Hood not credible and accepted the\n\n        probation officer\u2019s account that Hood refused to participate in mental health treatment at\n\n        Catawba, prompting them to demand he leave, and failing to attend the session at Three\n\n        Trees. This conclusion is further supported by Hood\u2019s conduct at the hearings, as Hood\n\n        repeatedly deflected and refused to agree to attend treatment whenever the district court\n\n        sought to address his stated concerns.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4338      Doc: 24         Filed: 01/19/2024      Pg: 5 of 5\n\n\n\n\n               Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument\n\n        because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this\n\n        court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                                        AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 23-4338      Doc: 24         Filed: 01/19/2024    Pg: 1 of 5\n\n\n\n\n                                            UNPUBLISHED\n\n                               UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                   FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                              No. 23-4338\n\n\n        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                            Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n                     v.\n\n        MONTELLO MARQUETTE HOOD,\n\n                            Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, at Rock\n        Hill.

See TEX. OCC. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 1701.655. We affirm.\n\n                                    I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On February 28, 2022, Officer Joel Padilla with the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s\n\nOffice Special Investigations Unit was advised that a vehicle with possible narcotics was\n\nheaded in his direction. Officer Padilla received a description of the vehicle, and he \u201cpulled\n\nover on the side of the expressway [to wait] for the vehicle to appear.\u201d A vehicle matching\n\nthe description appeared approximately thirty minutes later and Officer Padilla proceeded\n\nto follow it. Officer Padilla later learned this was Gomez\u2019s vehicle. After following Gomez,\n\nwitnessing him weave in and out of traffic in an unsafe manner, and noticing one of the\n\nvehicle\u2019s brake lights was out, Officer Padilla turned on his lights and pulled Gomez over.\n\nOfficer Padilla then explained the traffic violations to Gomez and asked him if he had any\n\nnarcotics in the vehicle. Officer Padilla testified that Gomez responded no, and that\n\nGomez consented to his request to search the vehicle. Gomez then signed a waiver form,\n\nwhich was entered into evidence.\n\n       Shortly after initiating the traffic stop, Deputy Angel Perez arrived on scene with a\n\ndrug-sniffing dog. According to Deputy Perez, the dog \u201cgave a positive alert to the area\n\nof the front seat and the dashboard.\u201d Officer Padilla and Deputy Perez both testified that\n\nthey noticed the dashboard had mismatched screws and some of the screws were loose.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fThe officers removed the car\u2019s dashboard and found a hidden \u201cbrick\u201d of cocaine. Officer\n\nPadilla then arrested Gomez and transported him to the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n       Deputy Carlos Martinez interviewed Gomez at the sheriff\u2019s office. He read Gomez\n\nhis Miranda rights and Gomez signed a waiver form that restated these rights. Gomez\n\nthen admitted that his intent was to transport the cocaine to Louisiana and to sell it there.\n\nDeputy Martinez typed out Gomez\u2019s confession and had Gomez review and sign it.\n\nDeputy Martinez testified that Gomez never indicated that he did not want to talk to him\n\nand testified that he did not threaten or force Gomez into giving his statement.\n\n       Gomez moved to suppress the statement he gave to Deputy Martinez. In a pretrial\n\nhearing, the defense argued that Gomez\u2019s statement was not voluntary because his\n\nsignature on the Miranda waiver looked different than his signature on the confession.\n\nThe trial court denied the motion to suppress. The Miranda waiver and Gomez\u2019s written\n\nstatement were admitted as evidence. Gomez\u2019s counsel later cross-examined Deputy\n\nMartinez about Gomez\u2019s signature on the documents. Deputy Martinez testified that he\n\npersonally witnessed Gomez sign both documents.\n\n       The jury found Gomez guilty and sentenced him to twenty-five years\u2019\n\nimprisonment. This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.    DISCUSSION\n\n       By his sole issue, Gomez argues that the trial court erred in admitting the officers\u2019\n\ntestimony because the officers were not wearing body worn cameras as mandated by\n\nTexas Occupation Code \u00a7 1701.655, which requires \u201c[a] law enforcement agency that\n\nreceives a grant to provide body worn cameras to its peace officers or that otherwise\n\n\n                                             3\n\foperates a body worn camera program shall adopt a policy for the use of body worn\n\ncameras.\u201d 1 See TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 1701.655. Gomez argues that the officers\u2019 failure\n\nto comply with \u00a7 1701.655 \u201chas called into question the reliability of the evidence\n\nsubmitted, creating a structural error making a fair trial unobtainable\u201d and violating his\n\nDue Process rights.\n\n        Our review of a trial court\u2019s improper admission or exclusion of evidence depends\n\non whether the error was properly preserved by the party at trial. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n33.1(a)(1). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals clarified in Proenza v. State that\n\nappellate courts should follow the rules of error preservation previously established in\n\nMarin v. State, 851 S.W.2d 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). Proenza, 541 S.W.3d at 793\u201397.\n\nUnder the Marin framework, errors are placed in one of three \u201ccategories\u201d of preservation\n\ndepending on the rights involved: \u201c(1) absolute requirements and prohibitions; (2) rights\n\nof litigants which must be implemented by the system unless expressly waived; and\n\n(3) rights of litigants which are to be implemented upon request.\u201d Id. at 792 (quoting Marin,\n\n851 S.W.2d at 279).\n\n        The Marin court described a category-three right as forfeitable, which can be lost\n\n\u201cfor failure to insist upon it by objection, request, motion, or some other behavior\n\ncalculated to exercise the right in a manner comprehensible to the system\u2019s impartial\n\nrepresentative, usually the trial judge.\u201d Id. (citing Zillender v. State, 557 S.W.2d 515, 517\n\n\n\n\n         1 We note that Gomez does not clarify what evidence he believes the trial court erred in admitting;\n\nin particular, he does not explain whether he is contesting the admission of the seized narcotics or the\ncustodial written statement. Because he does not reference the seized narcotics or the statement, we\nconstrue his brief as arguing that only the testimony from Officer Padilla, Deputy Perez, and Deputy\nMartinez describing Gomez\u2019s arrest and confession should have been excluded.\n                                                     4\n\f(Tex. Crim. App. 1977)). In the middle, category-two rights \u201cmust be protected by the\n\nsystem\u2019s impartial representatives unless expressly waived by the party to whom they\n\nbelong.\u201d Id. Finally, category-one Marin rights, described as \u201csystemic requirements and\n\nprohibitions\u201d that \u201care essentially independent of the litigant\u2019s wishes,\u201d cannot be forfeited\n\nor waived. Id.\n\n        Here, Gomez\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the admission of the officers\u2019\n\ntestimony as a violation of Texas Occupation Code \u00a7 1701.655. Gomez does not cite to\n\nany precedent as to why this error is a non-waivable right, and we are unable to find any.\n\nSee Proenza, 541 S.W.3d at 793\u201397; Saldano v. State, 70 S.W.3d 873, 889 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002) (\u201cWe have consistently held that the failure to object in a timely and specific\n\nmanner during trial forfeits complaints about the admissibility of evidence.\u201d (collecting\n\ncases)); see also TEX. R. EVID. 103(a)(1) (providing that a party may only preserve error\n\nin a ruling to admit or exclude evidence if the error affects a substantial right of the party\n\nand the party \u201c(A) timely objects or moves to strike; and (B) states the specific ground,\n\nunless it was apparent from the context\u201d).\n\n        Accordingly, Gomez has not preserved the error for appellate review. See TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 33.1(a)(1). 2 Because the issue has not been preserved, we do not reach the issue\n\n\n        2 Gomez contends that the officers\u2019 alleged violation of \u00a7 1701.655 is \u201cstructural error\u201d and is not\n\nsubject to ordinary error preservation rules or a harm analysis. Schmutz v. State, 440 S.W.3d 29, 38 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2014) (\u201cOnly structural error requires reversal without any harm analysis . . . .\u201d). However, the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that structural error only applies to errors enumerated as such\nby the United States Supreme Court. Lake v. State, 532 S.W.3d 408, 411 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (citing\nCain v. State, 947 S.W.2d 262, 264 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)); see also Gray v. State, 159 S.W.3d 95, 96\u2013\n97 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (\u201c[E]ven when an error does constitute a violation of the federal constitution, the\nerror is \u2018structural\u2019 only if the Supreme Court has labeled it as such.\u201d). Because Gomez does not argue that\nthe alleged error aligns with any precedent set by the United States Supreme Court, and we are unable to\nfind any precedent to that effect, he has failed to show that any alleged error was not waived. Id. at 98\n\n                                                     5\n\fof whether the trial court erred or whether Gomez suffered harm from any error. 3 We\n\noverrule Gomez\u2019s sole issue.\n\n                                           III.    CONCLUSION\n\n        The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                            DORI CONTRERAS\n                                                                            Chief Justice\nDo not publish.\nTEX.

Gomez argues that the officers\u2019 failure\n\nto comply with \u00a7 1701.655 \u201chas called into question the reliability of the evidence\n\nsubmitted, creating a structural error making a fair trial unobtainable\u201d and violating his\n\nDue Process rights.\n\n        Our review of a trial court\u2019s improper admission or exclusion of evidence depends\n\non whether the error was properly preserved by the party at trial. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n33.1(a)(1). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals clarified in Proenza v. State that\n\nappellate courts should follow the rules of error preservation previously established in\n\nMarin v.

By what we construe as two issues, the Crewses contend that the trial court\n\nerred by: (1) granting summary judgment, and (2) not following its own scheduling order\n\nwhen determining the merits of the Galvans\u2019 summary judgment motion. We affirm.\n\f                                      I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       As is customary of cases involving a claim of res judicata, there are two\n\nproceedings that are relevant to our analysis. We detail the background of the original\n\ncase first.1 On November 5, 2018, the Galvans sued the Crewses in trial court cause\n\nnumber 2018-DCL-06387-I for: (1) assault; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress;\n\n(3) defamation per se; and (4) \u201c[p]ublic [d]isclosure of [p]rivate [f]acts.\u201d On December 12,\n\n2018, the Crewses filed a motion to dismiss the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim pursuant to\n\nthe Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). Though the trial court initially denied the\n\nCrewses\u2019 motion, this Court reversed that decision. See Crews v. Galvan, No. 13-19-\n\n00110-CV, 2019 WL 5076516, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg Oct. 10, 2019,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n       On April 17, 2020, the Crewses filed a counterpetition, alleging causes of action\n\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious civil prosecution. According to\n\nthe counterpetition, the Galvans\u2019 actions in bringing and prosecuting an unmeritorious\n\ndefamation claim against the Crewses caused the couple to suffer damages. The Galvans\n\nmoved at various times to nonsuit their claims without prejudice. At a hearing, the Galvans\n\nlater orally amended their nonsuit motions to be with prejudice.\n\n       On April 28, 2020, the trial court signed an order dismissing with prejudice all of\n\nthe Galvans\u2019 claims, except for their defamation claim. On June 9, 2020, the trial court\n\nsigned an order dismissing the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim with prejudice and awarding\n\n\n\n\n       1 We derive the background of the first proceeding from the summary judgment evidence filed in\n\nthe second proceeding.\n                                                 2\n\fthe Crewses attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and sanctions.2 On October 27, 2020, the trial court\n\nsigned a clarification order, in which the trial court found that the Galvans\u2019 \u201cnonsuit of their\n\nclaims barred [the Crewses]\u2019 counterclaims.\u201d The Crewses filed a motion for new trial on\n\nNovember 25, 2020, arguing that the Galvans\u2019 nonsuit of their claims did not impact the\n\nCrewses\u2019 ability to seek affirmative relief. On January 26, 2021, the trial court denied the\n\nCrewses\u2019 motion for new trial by written order.\n\n        We turn now to the background of the proceeding underlying this appeal. On\n\nOctober 30, 2020, the Crewses filed an original petition in trial court cause number 2020-\n\nDCL-05323-I asserting the same causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress and malicious civil prosecution as they asserted in the prior proceeding. On\n\nFebruary 5, 2021, the Galvans filed an amended answer and asserted the affirmative\n\ndefense of res judicata. The Galvans also sought sanctions against the Crewses for filing\n\na frivolous lawsuit.\n\n        On August 2, 2021, the Galvans filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking\n\njudgment as a matter of law on their affirmative defense of res judicata. The Galvans\n\nargued in their motion that the trial court\u2019s October 27, 2020 order was a prior final\n\njudgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the identity of the parties\n\nwas the same as that in the prior proceeding, and that the claims asserted by the Crewses\n\nin the current proceeding were the same claims that were raised or could have been\n\nraised in the prior proceeding. In response, the Crewses argued that: (1) their previously\n\n\n        2 Although the signed judgment itself was not attached to either the motion for summary judgment\n\nor the summary judgment response, the parties agreed in their respective filings below that the trial court\ndismissed with prejudice the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim and awarded the Crewses court costs, attorney\u2019s\nfees, and sanctions on June 9, 2020.\n                                                    3\n\ffiled counterclaims were never adjudicated on the merits, and (2) their malicious\n\nprosecution claim did not accrue until the trial court signed its order dismissing the\n\nGalvans\u2019 defamation claim. On April 27, 2022, the trial court granted the Galvans\u2019 motion\n\nfor summary judgment and ordered that the Crewses take nothing in their claims against\n\nthe Galvans. This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n      We review summary judgments de novo. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Xerox State &\n\nLocal Sols., Inc., 663 S.W.3d 569, 576 (Tex. 2023). \u201cA party moving for traditional\n\nsummary judgment must prove that no genuine issue of material fact exists and it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id. \u201cA defendant who conclusively negates at\n\nleast one of the essential elements of a cause of action or conclusively establishes an\n\naffirmative defense is entitled to summary judgment.\u201d Frost Nat. Bank v. Fernandez, 315\n\nS.W.3d 494, 508 (Tex. 2010).\n\n      \u201cWhen reviewing a summary judgment, we take as true all evidence favorable to\n\nthe nonmovant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\n\nnonmovant\u2019s favor.\u201d Provident Life & Accident Ins. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.\n\n2003). The burden of proof does not shift to the non-movant unless and until the movant\n\nhas established his entitlement to summary judgment by conclusively proving all of the\n\nessential elements of his cause of action or defense as a matter of law. Draughon v.\n\nJohnson, 631 S.W.3d 81, 87\u201388 (Tex. 2021) (citing Casso v. Brand, 776 S.W.2d 551,\n\n556 (Tex. 1989)). \u201cAn issue is conclusively established \u2018if reasonable minds could not\n\ndiffer about the conclusion to be drawn from the facts in the record.\u2019\u201d Cmty. Health Systs.\n\n\n                                            4\n\fPro. Servs. Corp. v. Hansen, 525 S.W.3d 671, 681 (Tex. 2017) (quoting Childs v.\n\nHaussecker, 974 S.W.2d 31, 44 (Tex. 1998)). If the movant conclusively establishes its\n\ncause of action or defense as a matter of law, the burden of proof shifts to the nonmovant\n\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact. Energen Res. Corp. v. Wallace, 642 S.W.3d 502,\n\n514 (Tex. 2022).\n\n                                    III.   RES JUDICATA\n\n       The Crewses argue that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on\n\nthe Galvans\u2019 affirmative defense of res judicata.\n\nA.     Elements of Res Judicata\n\n       \u201cThe party asserting the defense of res judicata has the burden of proving each\n\nelement of the defense.\u201d Eagle Oil & Gas Co. v. TRO-X, L.P., 619 S.W.3d 699, 706 (Tex.\n\n2021). Res judicata requires proof of: \u201c(1) a prior final judgment on the merits by a court\n\nof competent jurisdiction; (2) identity of parties or those in privity with them; and (3) a\n\nsecond action based on the same claims that were raised or could have been raised in\n\nthe first action.\u201d Citizens Ins. Co. of Am. v. Daccach, 217 S.W.3d 430, 449 (Tex. 2007).\n\n\u201cRes judicata, or claims preclusion, prevents the relitigation of a claim or cause of action\n\nthat has been finally adjudicated, as well as related matters that, with the use of diligence,\n\nshould have been litigated in the prior suit.\u201d Barr v. Resol. Tr. Corp. ex rel. Sunbelt Fed.\n\nSav., 837 S.W.2d 627, 628 (Tex. 1992).\n\n       The Crewses take issue with two of the three elements of res judicata. They\n\nspecifically contend that: (1) while there was a prior final judgment, it was not on the\n\nmerits; and (2) the second action was not based on claims that could have been raised\n\n\n                                              5\n\fin the prior proceeding.3 We address their contentions in turn.\n\nB.      Final Judgment on the Merits\n\n        \u201cThe same rules of interpretation apply in construing the meaning of court orders\n\nas in ascertaining the meaning of other written instruments.\u201d Lal v. Harris Methodist Fort\n\nWorth, 230 S.W.3d 468, 474 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2007, no pet.). \u201cWe give terms their\n\nplain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning unless the instrument shows that the\n\nparties used them in a technical or different sense.\u201d Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank,\n\n939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996). We consider the record before us and the order in its\n\nentirety when ascertaining its meaning. Palomin v. Zarsky Lumber Co., 26 S.W.3d 690,\n\n695 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2000, pet. denied). \u201c[A] judgment must show\n\nintrinsically and distinctly, rather than inferentially, that the matters in the record have\n\nbeen determined in favor of one of the litigants or that the rights of the parties in litigation\n\nhave been adjudicated.\u201d Redwine v. Peckinpaugh, 535 S.W.3d 44, 48 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler\n\n2017, no pet.). \u201cAt its core, a judgment grants or denies relief.\u201d Shetewy v. Mediation Inst.\n\nof N. Tex., LLC, 624 S.W.3d 285, 288 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2021, no pet.).\n\n        As an initial matter, the Crewses seem to dispute that the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nto enter its October 27, 2020 order after the Galvans nonsuited their claims. However, it\n\nis well-settled that a court has jurisdiction to address collateral matters, like the Crewses\u2019\n\ncounterclaims, after a nonsuit has been taken. See Travelers Ins. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d\n\n860, 863 (Tex. 2010) (\u201cAfter a nonsuit, a trial court retains jurisdiction to address collateral\n\nmatters, such as motions for sanctions, even when such motions are filed after the\n\n\n        3 The Crewses do not contest that the identity of the parties is the same in this proceeding as it\n\nwas in the prior proceeding.\n                                                    6\n\fnonsuit, as well as jurisdiction over any remaining counterclaims.\u201d). The October 27, 2020\n\norder states that \u201c[a]fter considering the motion, the pleadings, and arguments of counsel,\n\nthe Court finds . . . [that the] Plaintiffs\u2019 nonsuit of their claims barred Defendants\u2019\n\ncounterclaims.\u201d And at its core, this judgment clearly denies relief to the Crewses. See\n\nShetewy, 624 S.W.3d at 288.\n\n       The parties discuss certain, nonprecedential authority holding that a dismissal\n\norder which is silent on whether it was made with or without prejudice is nonetheless with\n\nprejudice.

Merriam-Webster defines \u201cbar\u201d as \u201cto put forth legal objection to (something, such\n\nas a claim or action,\u201d \u201cto prevent (a party) from bringing a claim or action,\u201d or to \u201cprevent,\n\nforbid.\u201d MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/\n\nbar#dictionary-entry-2 (last accessed, 11/2/2023).

Similarly, when defining the term as a verb, Black\u2019s Law\n\nDictionary provides that \u201cbar\u201d means \u201c[t]o prohibit, esp. by legal objection,\u201d and provides\n\nas an example: \u201c[T]he statutes of limitations barred the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful-death claim.\u201d\n\n\n                                              7\n\fBar, BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY.\n\n       Thus, if a claim is \u201cbarred,\u201d that generally means it is not allowed to proceed, and\n\nsuch a determination is one on the merits. See, e.g., Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183,\n\n190 (1947) (\u201cIt is a misconception of res judicata to assume that the doctrine does not\n\ncome into operation if a court has not passed on the \u2018merits\u2019 in the sense of the ultimate\n\nsubstantive issues of a litigation.

The Crewses\u2019 motion for new trial, which asserted that their\n\nclaims were not barred, was denied by written order. Therefore, the policies underlying\n\nres judicata demand that we respect the finality of the trial court\u2019s original judgment. See\n\nEngelman Irrigation Dist. v.

We\n\nconclude that the trial court\u2019s previous judgment was a final judgment on the merits of the\n\nCrewses\u2019 counterclaims.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fC.

Determining\n\nwhich causes of action or defenses should have been litigated in a prior suit \u201crequires an\n\nanalysis of the factual matters that make up the gist of the complaint, without regard to\n\nthe form of action.\u201d Id.\n\n       The Crewses alleged causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\nand malicious civil prosecution in both the original proceeding and in the subsequent suit.\n\nIn the original suit, the Crewses asserted that the Galvans brought a frivolous suit against\n\nthe Crewses to cause them distress. These facts are indistinguishable from those alleged\n\nin the subsequent suit. \u201c[W]hen, as here, the issue or claim a defendant seeks to preclude\n\nwas indeed raised in a prior suit, the prior tribunal must have actually determined the\n\nissue or claim on its merits for res judicata or collateral estoppel to bar the subsequent\n\nsuit.\u201d Welch v. Hrabar, 110 S.W.3d 601, 607 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet.\n\ndenied). We have already decided that there was a final judgment on the merits of the\n\nCrewses\u2019 counterclaims.\n\n       For purposes of resolving the third element of res judicata, we ordinarily would stop\n\nhere. See id.; see also Amstadt v. U.S. Brass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644, 653 (Tex. 1996)\n\n(\u201cBecause the . . . plaintiffs . . . brought virtually identical claims concerning the same\n\n\n                                             10\n\fsubject matter, we hold that res judicata bars the . . . plaintiffs\u2019 suit.\u201d). However, the\n\nCrewses also argue that their malicious prosecution claim had not yet accrued, as the\n\nprior proceeding had not terminated in their favor until the trial court dismissed the\n\nGalvans\u2019 claims.4 See Pisharodi v. Columbia Valley Healthcare Syst., L.P., 622 S.W.3d\n\n74, 85 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2020, no pet.) (\u201cTo prevail on a suit alleging\n\nmalicious prosecution of a civil claim, [appellant] must have shown that: . . . termination\n\nof the proceeding was in his favor . . . .\u201d). Therefore, according to the Crewses they could\n\nnot have brought the claim in the prior proceeding, and thus, res judicata does not bar\n\ntheir claim. See Musgrave v. Owen, 67 S.W.3d 513, 522 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2002,\n\nno pet.) (\u201c[R]es judicata does not apply to claims that are not mature at the time of the\n\nprior proceeding.\u201d).\n\n        The Galvans contend that this misconstrues what the third element of res judicata\n\nrequires. This element bars second actions based \u201cnot only on matters actually litigated,\n\nbut also on causes of action or defenses which arise out of the same subject matter and\n\nwhich might have been litigated in the first suit.\u201d Barr, 837 S.W.2d 627 (quoting Tex. Water\n\nRights Comm\u2019n v. Crow Iron Works, 582 S.W.2d 768, 771\u201372 (Tex. 1979)) (emphasis\n\nmodified). The Crewses\u2019 claims falls into the first category of claims barred by res judicata\n\n(i.e., they were claims actually litigated). See id.\n\n\n         4 The Crewses also argue that their claim had not accrued because they had not yet deposed the\n\nGalvans. Having read the depositions which are included in the record as summary judgment evidence, we\nunderstand that additional facts were elicited that support the Crewses counterclaims. However, a claim\ngenerally accrues when \u201ca wrongful act causes a legal injury, even if the fact of injury is not discovered until\nlater, and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred.\u201d Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Pasko, 544\nS.W.3d 830, 834 (Tex. 2018) (quoting Sw. Energy Prod. Co. v. Berry-Helfand, 491 S.W.3d 699, 721 (Tex.\n2016)). The Crewses do not argue that the discovery rule applied to their claim, nor do they provide any\nother explanation as to the relevance of the timing of the depositions. See id. We therefore conclude that\nthe depositions did not affect the accrual of the Crewses\u2019 malicious prosecution claim.\n                                                      11\n\f       We will assume without deciding that the Galvans were required to show that the\n\nCrewses \u201ccould have\u201d brought their malicious prosecution claim. \u201cWhere a defendant\n\nasserts a cross-claim against a coparty . . . . [t]he cross-claimant becomes a plaintiff for\n\nres judicata purposes and is required to assert all claims against the cross-defendant\n\narising from the subject matter of the original cross-claim.\u201d Pinebrook Props., Ltd. v.\n\nBrookhaven Lake Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, 77 S.W.3d 487, 496 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2002,\n\npet. denied); see Getty Oil Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 845 S.W.2d 794, 800 (Tex. 1992).\n\nIn determining whether a subsequent claim could have been brought, we consider\n\nwhether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a\n\nconvenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a trial unit conforms to the parties\u2019\n\nexpectations. Daccach, 217 S.W.3d at 449 (citing Barr, 837 S.W.2d at 631).\n\n       The facts in the Crewses\u2019 malicious prosecution claim were the same as those in\n\ntheir intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Namely, the Galvans brought a\n\nfrivolous suit in response to the Crewses\u2019 exercise of their free speech, and the Crewses\n\nsuffered damages as a result. Even if the Crewses had to prove different elements for\n\ntheir malicious prosecution and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, as they\n\ncontend, both claims were based on the same wrongful act\u2014the Galvans\u2019 lawsuit\u2014and\n\nthey were therefore based on the same nucleus of operative facts. See Pinebrook Props.,\n\nLtd., 77 S.W.3d at 496 (\u201cWhere the claims arise from the same accident or seek to recover\n\nfor the same injuries, they have been found to share the same nucleus of operative facts\n\ndespite the fact that one claim may require proof of facts not required for the other claim.\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, \u201c[b]ecause the claims arose from the same operative facts, they would have\n\n\n                                              12\n\fformed a convenient trial unit, and their treatment as a trial unit conformed with the parties\u2019\n\nexpectations.\u201d See Hill v. Tx-An Anesthesia Mgmt., 443 S.W.3d 416, 426 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nDallas 2014, no pet.).\n\n       In Getty Oil, the Supreme Court of Texas considered and rejected an argument\n\nvery similar to the Crewses\u2019:\n\n       Getty argues that res judicata cannot bar its present claims against NL\n       because these claims did not accrue until judgment was rendered in the\n       Duncan suit. . . . The contingent nature of these claims, however, does not\n       preclude the operation of res judicata. . . . Getty could have asserted its\n       present claims in the Duncan suit, with their resolution being contingent on\n       the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\n845 S.W.2d at 800. Applying the reasoning of Getty Oil to the facts at hand, even if the\n\nCrewses\u2019 malicious prosecution claim was contingent on success in the original suit, they\n\nnonetheless could have brought these claims in the original suit, and thus, the Galvans\n\nhave shown the third element of res judicata applies to the Crewses\u2019 claims. See id. We\n\nconclude that the Galvans met their summary judgment burden on their affirmative\n\ndefense of res judicata. We overrule the Crewses\u2019 first issue.\n\n                                 IV.    SCHEDULING ORDER\n\n       By their second issue, the Crewses argue that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby extending the summary judgment deadlines beyond those it originally set in its\n\nscheduling order. However, the Crewses cite no authority whatsoever to support this\n\nargument. We therefore conclude that the Crewses have not adequately briefed this\n\nissue, and we overrule it. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (\u201cThe brief must contain a clear and\n\nconcise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and\n\nto the record.\u201d).\n\n                                              13\n\f                                  V.

By what we construe as two issues, the Crewses contend that the trial court\n\nerred by: (1) granting summary judgment, and (2) not following its own scheduling order\n\nwhen determining the merits of the Galvans\u2019 summary judgment motion. We affirm.\n\f                                      I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       As is customary of cases involving a claim of res judicata, there are two\n\nproceedings that are relevant to our analysis. We detail the background of the original\n\ncase first.1 On November 5, 2018, the Galvans sued the Crewses in trial court cause\n\nnumber 2018-DCL-06387-I for: (1) assault; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress;\n\n(3) defamation per se; and (4) \u201c[p]ublic [d]isclosure of [p]rivate [f]acts.\u201d On December 12,\n\n2018, the Crewses filed a motion to dismiss the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim pursuant to\n\nthe Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). Though the trial court initially denied the\n\nCrewses\u2019 motion, this Court reversed that decision. See Crews v. Galvan, No. 13-19-\n\n00110-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019 WL 5076516</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg Oct. 10, 2019,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n       On April 17, 2020, the Crewses filed a counterpetition, alleging causes of action\n\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious civil prosecution. According to\n\nthe counterpetition, the Galvans\u2019 actions in bringing and prosecuting an unmeritorious\n\ndefamation claim against the Crewses caused the couple to suffer damages. The Galvans\n\nmoved at various times to nonsuit their claims without prejudice. At a hearing, the Galvans\n\nlater orally amended their nonsuit motions to be with prejudice.\n\n       On April 28, 2020, the trial court signed an order dismissing with prejudice all of\n\nthe Galvans\u2019 claims, except for their defamation claim. On June 9, 2020, the trial court\n\nsigned an order dismissing the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim with prejudice and awarding\n\n\n\n\n       1 We derive the background of the first proceeding from the summary judgment evidence filed in\n\nthe second proceeding.\n                                                 2\n\fthe Crewses attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and sanctions.2 On October 27, 2020, the trial court\n\nsigned a clarification order, in which the trial court found that the Galvans\u2019 \u201cnonsuit of their\n\nclaims barred [the Crewses]\u2019 counterclaims.\u201d The Crewses filed a motion for new trial on\n\nNovember 25, 2020, arguing that the Galvans\u2019 nonsuit of their claims did not impact the\n\nCrewses\u2019 ability to seek affirmative relief. On January 26, 2021, the trial court denied the\n\nCrewses\u2019 motion for new trial by written order.\n\n        We turn now to the background of the proceeding underlying this appeal. On\n\nOctober 30, 2020, the Crewses filed an original petition in trial court cause number 2020-\n\nDCL-05323-I asserting the same causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress and malicious civil prosecution as they asserted in the prior proceeding. On\n\nFebruary 5, 2021, the Galvans filed an amended answer and asserted the affirmative\n\ndefense of res judicata. The Galvans also sought sanctions against the Crewses for filing\n\na frivolous lawsuit.\n\n        On August 2, 2021, the Galvans filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking\n\njudgment as a matter of law on their affirmative defense of res judicata. The Galvans\n\nargued in their motion that the trial court\u2019s October 27, 2020 order was a prior final\n\njudgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the identity of the parties\n\nwas the same as that in the prior proceeding, and that the claims asserted by the Crewses\n\nin the current proceeding were the same claims that were raised or could have been\n\nraised in the prior proceeding. In response, the Crewses argued that: (1) their previously\n\n\n        2 Although the signed judgment itself was not attached to either the motion for summary judgment\n\nor the summary judgment response, the parties agreed in their respective filings below that the trial court\ndismissed with prejudice the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim and awarded the Crewses court costs, attorney\u2019s\nfees, and sanctions on June 9, 2020.\n                                                    3\n\ffiled counterclaims were never adjudicated on the merits, and (2) their malicious\n\nprosecution claim did not accrue until the trial court signed its order dismissing the\n\nGalvans\u2019 defamation claim. On April 27, 2022, the trial court granted the Galvans\u2019 motion\n\nfor summary judgment and ordered that the Crewses take nothing in their claims against\n\nthe Galvans. This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n      We review summary judgments de novo. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

SCHEDULING ORDER\n\n       By their second issue, the Crewses argue that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby extending the summary judgment deadlines beyond those it originally set in its\n\nscheduling order. However, the Crewses cite no authority whatsoever to support this\n\nargument. We therefore conclude that the Crewses have not adequately briefed this\n\nissue, and we overrule it. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (\u201cThe brief must contain a clear and\n\nconcise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and\n\nto the record.\u201d).\n\n                                              13\n\f                                  V.

The trial court declared that Robinson\n\nwas not responsible for the property taxes, mortgage payments, or maintenance, repair,\n\fand improvement expenses incurred by Murray. However, it declared that Robinson was\n\nresponsible for one half of the insurance premiums paid for the structures on the property.\n\nIn three issues, which we reframe and construe as two issues, Murray argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in: (1) not granting judgment in Murray\u2019s favor; and (2) issuing declarations\n\nthat were not supported by the pleadings. We affirm. 1\n\n                                          I.       BACKGROUND\n\n        Murray and his wife, Florentina Murray, owned approximately seventy-eight acres\n\nof property in Travis County which constituted their homestead (the property). Florentina\n\ndied intestate in 1997. At the time of Florentina\u2019s passing, the property was\n\nunencumbered by any liens. In 1998, Robinson, Florentina\u2019s only child from a prior\n\nmarriage, filed an affidavit of heirship asserting an interest in the property pursuant to\n\nTexas\u2019s laws on intestate succession. 2 See TEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 102.003, 201.003(c).\n\n         After Florentina\u2019s death, Murray continued to reside on the property and claim it\n\nas his homestead, while Robinson resided elsewhere. In 2019, Murray sued Robinson,\n\nasserting causes of action for contribution and reimbursement, foreclosure of equitable\n\nlien, and declaratory judgment. Murray claimed that Robinson was responsible as a joint\n\nowner for fifty percent of the sums Murray paid for taxes, insurance, and repairs for the\n\nproperty. Murray also claimed Robinson was responsible for fifty percent of the principal\n\nand interest paid for a mortgage taken out on the property after Florentina\u2019s death. Finally,\n\nMurray claimed Robinson was responsible for fifty percent of the cost of improvements to\n\n\n        1 This case is before this Court on transfer from the Third Court of Appeals in Austin pursuant to a\n\ndocket-equalization order issued by the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001\n(granting the supreme court the authority to transfer cases from one court of appeals to another if there is\n\u201cgood cause\u201d for the transfer).\n        2 The parties agree that Robinson inherited a fifty percent interest in the property due to Florentina\u2019s\n\ncommunity interest in the property passing through intestate succession.\n\n                                                      2\n\fthe property and reimbursement for the resulting increase in value to the property.\n\n         Robinson filed an answer asserting a general denial, and the case proceeded to a\n\nbench trial. At trial, Murray testified that there was no probate administration for\n\nFlorentina\u2019s estate. He claimed that Florentina owed approximately $300,000 in debts at\n\nthe time of her death, although the property itself was not encumbered by those debts.\n\nFollowing Florentina\u2019s death, Murray took out two loans secured by a lien on the\n\nproperty\u2014$238,477.50 in 1998 and $410,000 in 2001. 3 Murray testified that the proceeds\n\nof the 1998 loan went toward paying the debts of Florentina\u2019s estate. He testified that\n\n$300,000 of the proceeds of the 2001 loan were used for the same purpose. Murray\n\nstated that he used the remaining $110,000 for private investment. Murray did not\n\nproduce any documentary evidence showing how the money for either loan was spent.\n\nMurray agreed that Robinson did not receive any proceeds from these loans. Robinson\n\ndid not sign the promissory note on either loan, and she was not personally liable on the\n\nloans.\n\n         According to Murray, he sought reimbursement from Robinson for the principal and\n\ninterest paid toward $300,000 of the 2001 loan, which constituted approximately\n\n$611,000 at the time of trial. Murray also spent $82,121.27 on homeowner\u2019s insurance\n\nthrough trial, although he claimed Robinson was only responsible for paying her share of\n\nsixty-seven percent, or $55,021.25, because that portion went toward insuring the\n\nstructures on the property. Murray testified that he paid a total of $335,997 in property\n\n\n\n          3 The loan documents reflect the entire seventy-eight acres as homestead. However, Murray\n\npresented evidence that he only claimed twenty acres of the property as homestead. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of this fact issue. See Howeth Invs., Inc. v. City of Hedwig Village, 259 S.W.3d 877, 894\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied) (explaining that \u201cit is the province of the trial court in a\nbench trial to resolve conflicting evidence,\u201d and \u201cwe must assume that it resolved all conflicts in accordance\nwith its fact findings\u201d).\n\n                                                      3\n\ftaxes. Murray also testified that he spent $135,459.95 to improve the property, which he\n\nclaimed increased the value of the property by $23,028.14.\n\n        The trial court signed a judgment, with the following declarations:\n\n        1.      The [property] was the marital homestead of [Murray] and\n                Florentina[], and [Murray] continues to occupy the [p]roperty under\n                his homestead rights as a surviving spouse;\n\n        2.      [Robinson] is not responsible for any of the ad valorem property\n                taxes on the [p]roperty;\n\n        3.      [Robinson] is not responsible for any payments, whether a principal\n                payment or an interest payment on the property;\n\n        4.      [Robinson] is not responsible for any of the maintenance, repairs, or\n                improvements made on or to the [p]roperty by [Murray]; and\n\n        5.      [Robinson] is responsible for one-half of the insurance premiums on\n                the structures and shall reimburse [Murray] for the paid insurance\n                premiums in the amount of $27,510.62.\n\nThe trial court signed the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n\n                                    I.      FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n        1.      The [property] was the marital homestead of [Murray] and\n                Florentina[ 4];\n\n        2.      Florentina[] passed away in 1997, and her \u00bd community property\n                interest in the [p]roperty passed by intestate succession to\n                []Robinson;\n\n        3.      [Murray] has exclusively occupied and continues to exclusively\n                occupy the [p]roperty under his homestead rights as the surviving\n                spouse of Florentina[];\n\n        4.      There were no liens on the [p]roperty at the death of Florentina[] in\n                1997;\n\n        5.      [Robinson] did not execute the Promissory Note, dated April 3, 1998,\n\n         4 As noted above, Murray claimed to present evidence that the homestead constituted only twenty\n\nacres of the property. However, Murray does not challenge this finding on appeal. See Pearl Res. LLC v.\nCharger Svcs., LLC, 622 S.W.3d 106, 115 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2020, pet. denied) (\u201c[I]f the trial court\u2019s\nfindings of fact are not challenged by a point of error on appeal, the appellate court is bound by them.\u201d).\n\n                                                    4\n\f             from [Murray] to Banc One Financial Services (\u201c1998 Note\u201d);\n\n      6.     [Robinson] did not execute the Texas Home Equity Fixed/Adjustable\n             Rate Note, dated July 23, 2001, from [Murray] to Long Beach\n             Mortgage Company (\u201c2001 Note\u201d);\n\n      7.     No proceeds from either the 1998 Note or the 2001 Note were used\n             to purchase the [p]roperty or refinance any debt used to purchase\n             the [p]roperty;\n\n      8.     [Robinson] did not receive any proceeds from either the 1998 Note\n             or the 2001 Note; and\n\n      9.     The total insurance premiums paid on the structures on the [p]roperty\n             since Florentina[\u2019s] death are $55,021.24.\n\n                            II.    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.     Since [Murray] is occupying the [p]roperty under his rights as the\n             surviving spouse, [Murray] is responsible for all of the ad valorem\n             taxes on the [p]roperty;\n\n      2.

[Robinson] is responsible for one half of the hazard insurance\n             premiums paid for the hazard insurance on the structures of the\n             policy which equals $27,510.62.\n\n      Murray filed a motion to correct, modify, and reform the judgment, which was\n\noverruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n                     II.     SURVIVING SPOUSE HOMESTEAD RIGHTS\n\n      In his first issue, Murray argues that the trial court erred in declaring that Robinson\n\nwas not obligated to reimburse him for any portion of the property taxes, loan payments,\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fmaintenance, repairs, or improvements pertaining to the property.\n\nA.

Analysis\n\n       Murray contends that he is entitled to contribution from Robinson because she is\n\na joint owner of the property and thus a tenant in common. Assuming he is entitled to\n\nreimbursement, Murray further argues that the trial court erred in not imposing an\n\nequitable lien and ordering a sale foreclosing that lien.\n\n       A child who inherits an interest in a property for which the surviving spouse\n\nmaintains a homestead interest owns only a remainder interest during the surviving\n\n\n       5 The Texas Estates Code further provides:\n\n\n\n       If the decedent was survived by a spouse or minor child, the homestead is not liable for\n       the payment of any of the debts of the estate, other than:\n\n               (1) purchase money for the homestead;\n               (2) taxes due on the homestead;\n               (3) work and material used in constructing improvements on the homestead if the\n                   requirements of Section 50(a)(5), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, are met;\n               (4) an owelty of partition imposed against the entirety of the property by a court\n                   order or written agreement of the parties to the partition, including a debt of\n                   one spouse in favor of the other spouse resulting from a division or an award\n                   of a family homestead in a divorce proceeding;\n               (5) the refinance of a lien against the homestead, including a federal tax lien\n                   resulting from the tax debt of both spouses, if the homestead is a family\n                   homestead, or from the tax debt of the decedent;\n               (6) an extension of credit on the homestead if the requirements of Section\n                   50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, are met; or\n               (7) a reverse mortgage.\n\nTEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7 102.004.\n\n                                                    8\n\fspouse\u2019s lifetime; therefore, a co-tenancy does not exist. See Sparks, 203 S.W.2d at 623\u2013\n\n24. Further, contrary to Murray\u2019s contention, the relationship remains the same whether\n\nthe surviving spouse still owns a portion of the homestead in fee simple due to his interest\n\nin the community estate. See LeBlanc, 761 S.W.2d at 453. Because Robinson possesses\n\nonly a remainder interest, the laws governing tenants in common do not apply. See\n\nSparks, 203 S.W.2d at 623\u201324. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in\n\nconcluding that Robinson is not responsible for any reimbursements under this theory.\n\nSee Wood, 650 S.W.3d at 544. Murray\u2019s arguments regarding the imposition of an\n\nequitable lien and an order of foreclosure are dependent upon his assertion of a co-\n\ntenancy relationship, and they necessarily fail for the same reasons.\n\n       In the alternative, Murray argues that, as a life tenant, he is still entitled to\n\nreimbursement for the principal reduction on the property\u2019s encumbrances and the full\n\namount of insurance premiums paid. As previously stated, Murray is only entitled to\n\nreimbursement for paying down the principal for an encumbrance that existed at the time\n\nRobinson inherited her interest. See Henry, 651 S.W.3d at 663. However, the trial court\n\nfound there were no liens on the property at the time of Florentina\u2019s death, and Murray\n\ndoes not challenge this finding on appeal. See Pearl Res. LLC v. Charger Servs., LLC,\n\n622 S.W.3d 106, 115 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2020, pet. denied) (\u201c[I]f the trial court\u2019s findings\n\nof fact are not challenged by a point of error on appeal, the appellate court is bound by\n\nthem.\u201d). The encumbrances on the property were created after Florentina\u2019s death, and\n\nRobinson did not receive any proceeds from the associated loans. Therefore, we hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err in concluding that Robinson is not responsible for\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\freimbursing Murray for the principal reduction. See Wood, 650 S.W.3d at 544.\n\n        With respect to full reimbursement of the insurance premiums, Murray cites\n\nauthority stating that a life tenant is not required to maintain insurance on the property for\n\nthe benefit of the remaindermen. See Richardson v. McCloskey, 276 S.W. 680, 684 (Tex.\n\n[Comm\u2019n Op.] 1925); Hill v. Hill, 623 S.W.2d 779, 781 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 1981, writ\n\nref\u2019d n.r.e.). However, Murray cites no authority, and we have found none, requiring\n\nreimbursement if the life tenant voluntarily insures the homestead property. Absent any\n\nauthority to the contrary, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that\n\nRobinson was not responsible for full reimbursement of the insurance premiums paid by\n\nMurray for the property. 6\n\n        Having rejected each of Murray\u2019s arguments, we overrule Murray\u2019s first issue.\n\n                                       III.    UNPLEADED CLAIMS\n\n        In his second issue, Murray argues that the trial court erred in granting relief to\n\nRobinson because Robinson was required to plead as an affirmative defense that she\n\nwas a remainderman rather than a co-owner of the property. Murray similarly argues that\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Robinson declaratory relief in the absence of pleadings.\n\nA.      Standard of Review & Applicable Law\n\n        A judgment must be supported by the pleadings, and a party may not be granted\n\nrelief in the absence of pleadings to support such relief.

We review de novo whether a\n\n\n\n\n        6 We note that Robinson agreed in the trial court that she was responsible for half of the insurance\n\npremiums for the structures on the property, and she does not file a cross-appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s\ndeclaration to that effect.\n\n                                                     10\n\ftrial court\u2019s judgment is supported by the pleadings.

Analysis\n\n       In his live pleading, Murray requested \u201ca declaratory judgment declaring the rights\n\nof the [p]arties with respect to the [p]roperty[.]\u201d Specifically, Murray sought declarations\n\nthat Robinson was responsible for reimbursement for one half of the amount Murray paid\n\nfor taxes, insurance, expenses, reduction in principal on encumbrances, interest, and\n\nimprovements. Murray also sought a declaration that Robinson owed reimbursement for\n\none half of the increase in value to the property. The trial court\u2019s declarations all pertained\n\nto Murray\u2019s requested relief, albeit in the negative. See Irwin, 627 S.W.3d at 269; see also\n\nSalomon, 369 S.W.3d at 553\u201354 (\u201cThe trial judge is not constrained to enter judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fonly in a form specified by one of the parties, because in addition to conforming to the\n\npleadings, the judgment must also reflect a correct application of the law[.]\u201d).\n\n       Because the declarations were authorized by Murray\u2019s pleadings, we conclude that\n\nthe trial court did not err in entering a declaratory judgment in the absence of an\n\naffirmative defense or claim pleaded by Robinson.

The trial court declared that Robinson\n\nwas not responsible for the property taxes, mortgage payments, or maintenance, repair,\n\fand improvement expenses incurred by Murray. However, it declared that Robinson was\n\nresponsible for one half of the insurance premiums paid for the structures on the property.\n\nIn three issues, which we reframe and construe as two issues, Murray argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in: (1) not granting judgment in Murray\u2019s favor; and (2) issuing declarations\n\nthat were not supported by the pleadings. We affirm. 1\n\n                                          I.       BACKGROUND\n\n        Murray and his wife, Florentina Murray, owned approximately seventy-eight acres\n\nof property in Travis County which constituted their homestead (the property). Florentina\n\ndied intestate in 1997. At the time of Florentina\u2019s passing, the property was\n\nunencumbered by any liens. In 1998, Robinson, Florentina\u2019s only child from a prior\n\nmarriage, filed an affidavit of heirship asserting an interest in the property pursuant to\n\nTexas\u2019s laws on intestate succession. 2 See TEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 102.003, 201.003(c).\n\n         After Florentina\u2019s death, Murray continued to reside on the property and claim it\n\nas his homestead, while Robinson resided elsewhere. In 2019, Murray sued Robinson,\n\nasserting causes of action for contribution and reimbursement, foreclosure of equitable\n\nlien, and declaratory judgment. Murray claimed that Robinson was responsible as a joint\n\nowner for fifty percent of the sums Murray paid for taxes, insurance, and repairs for the\n\nproperty. Murray also claimed Robinson was responsible for fifty percent of the principal\n\nand interest paid for a mortgage taken out on the property after Florentina\u2019s death. Finally,\n\nMurray claimed Robinson was responsible for fifty percent of the cost of improvements to\n\n\n        1 This case is before this Court on transfer from the Third Court of Appeals in Austin pursuant to a\n\ndocket-equalization order issued by the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001\n(granting the supreme court the authority to transfer cases from one court of appeals to another if there is\n\u201cgood cause\u201d for the transfer).\n        2 The parties agree that Robinson inherited a fifty percent interest in the property due to Florentina\u2019s\n\ncommunity interest in the property passing through intestate succession.\n\n                                                      2\n\fthe property and reimbursement for the resulting increase in value to the property.\n\n         Robinson filed an answer asserting a general denial, and the case proceeded to a\n\nbench trial. At trial, Murray testified that there was no probate administration for\n\nFlorentina\u2019s estate. He claimed that Florentina owed approximately $300,000 in debts at\n\nthe time of her death, although the property itself was not encumbered by those debts.\n\nFollowing Florentina\u2019s death, Murray took out two loans secured by a lien on the\n\nproperty\u2014$238,477.50 in 1998 and $410,000 in 2001. 3 Murray testified that the proceeds\n\nof the 1998 loan went toward paying the debts of Florentina\u2019s estate. He testified that\n\n$300,000 of the proceeds of the 2001 loan were used for the same purpose. Murray\n\nstated that he used the remaining $110,000 for private investment. Murray did not\n\nproduce any documentary evidence showing how the money for either loan was spent.\n\nMurray agreed that Robinson did not receive any proceeds from these loans. Robinson\n\ndid not sign the promissory note on either loan, and she was not personally liable on the\n\nloans.\n\n         According to Murray, he sought reimbursement from Robinson for the principal and\n\ninterest paid toward $300,000 of the 2001 loan, which constituted approximately\n\n$611,000 at the time of trial. Murray also spent $82,121.27 on homeowner\u2019s insurance\n\nthrough trial, although he claimed Robinson was only responsible for paying her share of\n\nsixty-seven percent, or $55,021.25, because that portion went toward insuring the\n\nstructures on the property. Murray testified that he paid a total of $335,997 in property\n\n\n\n          3 The loan documents reflect the entire seventy-eight acres as homestead. However, Murray\n\npresented evidence that he only claimed twenty acres of the property as homestead. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of this fact issue. See Howeth Invs., Inc. v.

The [property] was the marital homestead of [Murray] and\n                Florentina[], and [Murray] continues to occupy the [p]roperty under\n                his homestead rights as a surviving spouse;\n\n        2.

There were no liens on the [p]roperty at the death of Florentina[] in\n                1997;\n\n        5.      [Robinson] did not execute the Promissory Note, dated April 3, 1998,\n\n         4 As noted above, Murray claimed to present evidence that the homestead constituted only twenty\n\nacres of the property.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.     Since [Murray] is occupying the [p]roperty under his rights as the\n             surviving spouse, [Murray] is responsible for all of the ad valorem\n             taxes on the [p]roperty;\n\n      2.     Since [Murray] is occupying the [p]roperty under his rights as the\n             surviving spouse, [Murray] is responsible for all of the maintenance,\n             repairs, and/or improvements made to the [p]roperty;\n\n      3.     Since no proceeds of the 1998 Note or the 2001 Note were used to\n             purchase the [p]roperty or refinance any debt used to purchase the\n             [p]roperty, and since [Robinson] did not receive any proceeds from\n             the 1998 Note or the 2001 Note, [Robinson] is not responsible for\n             any principal or interest payments on either note.\n\n      4.     [Robinson] is responsible for one half of the hazard insurance\n             premiums paid for the hazard insurance on the structures of the\n             policy which equals $27,510.62.\n\n      Murray filed a motion to correct, modify, and reform the judgment, which was\n\noverruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n                     II.

Analysis\n\n       Murray contends that he is entitled to contribution from Robinson because she is\n\na joint owner of the property and thus a tenant in common. Assuming he is entitled to\n\nreimbursement, Murray further argues that the trial court erred in not imposing an\n\nequitable lien and ordering a sale foreclosing that lien.\n\n       A child who inherits an interest in a property for which the surviving spouse\n\nmaintains a homestead interest owns only a remainder interest during the surviving\n\n\n       5 The Texas Estates Code further provides:\n\n\n\n       If the decedent was survived by a spouse or minor child, the homestead is not liable for\n       the payment of any of the debts of the estate, other than:\n\n               (1) purchase money for the homestead;\n               (2) taxes due on the homestead;\n               (3) work and material used in constructing improvements on the homestead if the\n                   requirements of Section 50(a)(5), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, are met;\n               (4) an owelty of partition imposed against the entirety of the property by a court\n                   order or written agreement of the parties to the partition, including a debt of\n                   one spouse in favor of the other spouse resulting from a division or an award\n                   of a family homestead in a divorce proceeding;\n               (5) the refinance of a lien against the homestead, including a federal tax lien\n                   resulting from the tax debt of both spouses, if the homestead is a family\n                   homestead, or from the tax debt of the decedent;\n               (6) an extension of credit on the homestead if the requirements of Section\n                   50(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, are met; or\n               (7) a reverse mortgage.\n\nTEX.

Further, contrary to Murray\u2019s contention, the relationship remains the same whether\n\nthe surviving spouse still owns a portion of the homestead in fee simple due to his interest\n\nin the community estate. See LeBlanc, 761 S.W.2d at 453. Because Robinson possesses\n\nonly a remainder interest, the laws governing tenants in common do not apply. See\n\nSparks, 203 S.W.2d at 623\u201324. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in\n\nconcluding that Robinson is not responsible for any reimbursements under this theory.\n\nSee Wood, 650 S.W.3d at 544. Murray\u2019s arguments regarding the imposition of an\n\nequitable lien and an order of foreclosure are dependent upon his assertion of a co-\n\ntenancy relationship, and they necessarily fail for the same reasons.\n\n       In the alternative, Murray argues that, as a life tenant, he is still entitled to\n\nreimbursement for the principal reduction on the property\u2019s encumbrances and the full\n\namount of insurance premiums paid. As previously stated, Murray is only entitled to\n\nreimbursement for paying down the principal for an encumbrance that existed at the time\n\nRobinson inherited her interest. See Henry, 651 S.W.3d at 663. However, the trial court\n\nfound there were no liens on the property at the time of Florentina\u2019s death, and Murray\n\ndoes not challenge this finding on appeal. See Pearl Res. LLC v. Charger Servs., LLC,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">622 S.W.3d 106</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2020, pet. denied) (\u201c[I]f the trial court\u2019s findings\n\nof fact are not challenged by a point of error on appeal, the appellate court is bound by\n\nthem.\u201d). The encumbrances on the property were created after Florentina\u2019s death, and\n\nRobinson did not receive any proceeds from the associated loans. Therefore, we hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err in concluding that Robinson is not responsible for\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\freimbursing Murray for the principal reduction. See Wood, 650 S.W.3d at 544.\n\n        With respect to full reimbursement of the insurance premiums, Murray cites\n\nauthority stating that a life tenant is not required to maintain insurance on the property for\n\nthe benefit of the remaindermen. See Richardson v. McCloskey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">276 S.W. 680</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (Tex.\n\n[Comm\u2019n Op.] 1925); Hill v.

However, Murray cites no authority, and we have found none, requiring\n\nreimbursement if the life tenant voluntarily insures the homestead property. Absent any\n\nauthority to the contrary, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that\n\nRobinson was not responsible for full reimbursement of the insurance premiums paid by\n\nMurray for the property. 6\n\n        Having rejected each of Murray\u2019s arguments, we overrule Murray\u2019s first issue.\n\n                                       III.    UNPLEADED CLAIMS\n\n        In his second issue, Murray argues that the trial court erred in granting relief to\n\nRobinson because Robinson was required to plead as an affirmative defense that she\n\nwas a remainderman rather than a co-owner of the property. Murray similarly argues that\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Robinson declaratory relief in the absence of pleadings.\n\nA.

PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 22.01, 36.06, both third-degree felonies\n\nenhanced by appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions. See id. \u00a7 12.42(d). By five issues\n\nappellant argues (1)\u2013(2) the evidence is legally insufficient to support his convictions;\n\f(3) the trial court improperly denied his request to strike four venire members for cause;\n\n(4) \u201c[t]he trial court improperly denied [appellant\u2019s] request for a mistrial after the jury\n\ncontravened its instructions\u201d; and (5) the judgment is void as it does not comport with the\n\nsentence assessed by the trial court. We affirm as modified.\n\n                                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant was indicted on one count of assault on a public servant and one count\n\nof retaliation. He pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.\n\n       At trial, appellant\u2019s sister Oralia Garcia testified that she called the police in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 24, 2020, after appellant showed up at her doorstep around\n\n2 or 3 a.m., barefoot and shirtless, refusing to leave. Oralia stated that when she greeted\n\nappellant at the door, he demanded that she bring him something to drink. She retreated\n\ninside the home while he remained on the porch \u201cpraying and singing.\u201d Oralia testified\n\nthat she returned with a glass of water, and appellant then requested another drink. Upon\n\nreturning with the second drink, appellant took the drink and then picked up a planter off\n\nthe porch and threw it towards Oralia. Oralia quickly shut the front door to avoid getting\n\nhit with the planter. According to Oralia, there was nothing she had said or done prior to\n\nescalate the situation. Because appellant \u201ckept hitting the door\u201d and refused to leave,\n\nOralia called the police.\n\n       Oralia clarified that, at the time, appellant resided in a small trailer on her property,\n\nsituated behind her home, where she supports him financially. Oralia explained that it was\n\nnot unusual for appellant to appear on her doorstep demanding food or something to\n\ndrink, but appellant\u2019s timing and destructive behavior on this particular evening was\n\n\n                                               2\n\funusual. Oralia testified she briefly left the front porch area when officers arrived, and she\n\nreturned several minutes later to find appellant on the ground getting arrested. On cross-\n\nexamination, Oralia recalled hearing an officer instruct appellant to return to his trailer,\n\nand then later, Oralia heard appellant say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Oralia denied\n\nwitnessing the officer draw his weapon or taser.\n\n       DeWitt County Sheriff\u2019s Officer Juan Julian Ruiz Jr. testified that he was on patrol\n\non July 24, 2020, when he was dispatched to the residence. Deputy Ruiz stated he arrived\n\nto find appellant sitting on a porch swing shirtless and with only one shoe on. Deputy Ruiz\n\nidentified himself as law enforcement. \u201cAs I was walking up, he told me not to take another\n\nstep further. . . . He was going to f[-]ck me up,\u201d testified Deputy Ruiz. Deputy Ruiz, who\n\nwas familiar with appellant, testified that appellant appeared more aggravated than usual\n\nand \u201cjust wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d noting appellant\u2019s \u201cpinprick\u201d-sized pupils and suspecting\n\nappellant to be \u201cunder the influence of some kind of narcotics or alcoholic beverage.\u201d\n\n       After speaking with Oralia, Deputy Ruiz instructed appellant \u201cseveral times that he\n\nneed[ed] to go home\u201d and warned appellant that he would be arrested if he did not leave\n\nthe premises. Deputy Ruiz stated that appellant refused and told him that he would have\n\nto \u201ckill him to take him.\u201d Appellant then walked toward Deputy Ruiz and told him, \u201c[Y]ou\n\ndon\u2019t scare me, bitch. I\u2019ll f[-]ck you up.\u201d At that point, Deputy Ruiz notified appellant that\n\nhe was going to be handcuffed and instructed appellant to turn around. Deputy Ruiz said\n\nappellant pushed \u201coff\u201d him, inadvertently fell to the ground, and began kicking Deputy\n\nRuiz. As Deputy Ruiz radioed for backup, appellant struck Deputy Ruiz\u2019s legs \u201cmultiple\n\ntimes.\u201d Deputy Ruiz testified, \u201c[Appellant] was cursing at me the whole time. He told me,\n\n\n                                              3\n\f[\u2018]I told y\u2019all I was going to hurt you[\u2019] or [\u2018]I was going to f[-]ck you up if you touched me.[\u2019]\u201d\n\nDeputy Ruiz testified that he drew his taser after appellant attempted to grab a nearby\n\nobject off the ground. At the sight of the taser, appellant \u201cstopped fighting right there on\n\nthe spot\u201d and said, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Appellant was taken into custody.\n\n        The jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts, and the case proceeded to\n\npunishment, where the State presented evidence of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions.\n\nThe jury assessed punishment at thirty-five years\u2019 imprisonment for each count. The trial\n\ncourt ordered the sentences to run concurrent. This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.      SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n        By his first and second issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support his convictions for assault on a public servant and\n\nretaliation. 1\n\nA.      Standard of Review\n\n        In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, \u201cwe\n\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\u201d and determine whether,\n\nbased on the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, a rational juror could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Edward v. State,\n\n635 S.W.3d 649, 655 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\n\n319 (1979)); see Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 912 (adopting the standard of review for a\n\n\n        1 The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that only one standard should be used to evaluate\n\nwhether the evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction beyond a reasonable doubt: legal\nsufficiency. See Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 905\u201307 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (plurality op.); see also\nLongoria v. State, No. 13-22-00222-CR, 2023 WL 6631728, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg\nOct. 12, 2023, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for publication). Accordingly, we only apply the legal-\nsufficiency standard when addressing appellant\u2019s sufficiency arguments.\n\n                                                     4\n\fsufficiency challenge as set out by Jackson). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the\n\nresponsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the\n\nevidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d Edward,\n\n635 S.W.3d at 655; see Garcia v. State, 667 S.W.3d 756, 762 (Tex. Crim. App. 2023) (\u201cIf\n\nthe record supports conflicting inferences, the reviewing court must presume that the\n\nfactfinder resolved the conflicts in favor of the prosecution and defer to the jury\u2019s factual\n\ndeterminations.\u201d) (cleaned up). We remain mindful that \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence is as\n\nprobative as direct evidence in establishing guilt, and circumstantial evidence alone can\n\nbe sufficient to establish guilt.\u201d Delagarza v. State, 635 S.W.3d 716, 723 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nCorpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2021, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Nisbett v. State, 552 S.W.3d 244, 262\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2018)). We measure the sufficiency of the evidence by comparing the\n\nevidence produced at trial against \u201cthe essential elements of the offense as defined by\n\nthe hypothetically correct jury charge.\u201d Curlee v. State, 620 S.W.3d 767, 778 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2021) (quoting Malik v. State, 953 S.W.2d 234, 240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)).\n\nB.     Assault of a Public Servant\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       Assault of a public servant requires proof of misdemeanor assault and that\n       (1) the complainant was a public servant; (2) the actor knew that the\n       complainant was a public servant; (3) the complainant was discharging an\n       official duty when he was assaulted; and (4) the official duty was being\n       discharged lawfully.\n\nCuevas v. State, 576 S.W.3d 398, 399 (Tex. Crim. App. 2019); see TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 22.01(a)(1), (b)(1). Under the Texas Penal Code, a person acts intentionally when it is\n\nhis conscious objective or desire to cause the result of his action. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\n\n                                              5\n\f\u00a7 6.03(a). A person acts knowingly when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably\n\ncertain to cause the result.

The risk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a\n\ngross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under\n\nall the circumstances as viewed from the actor\u2019s standpoint. Id. The definition of \u201cbodily\n\ninjury\u201d is purposefully broad, see id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(8), and includes physical pain \u201chowever\n\nminor.\u201d Garcia v. State, 367 S.W.3d 683, 688 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); see also Cabello v.\n\nState, No. 13-19-00341-CR, 2022 WL 3451368, at *25 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013\n\nEdinburg Aug. 18, 2022, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (\u201cThe\n\nexistence of a cut, bruise, or scrape on the body is sufficient evidence of physical pain\n\nnecessary to establish \u2018bodily injury\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d (quoting Arzaga\n\nv. State, 86 S.W.3d 767, 778 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2002, no pet.))).\n\n       2.     Analysis\n\n       Appellant argues the State failed to produce evidence that Deputy Ruiz was\n\nlawfully discharging an official duty at the time of the assault because appellant \u201cwas not\n\nengaged in public intoxication, as he was not in a public place.\u201d We find Cuevas, a recent\n\nTexas Criminal Court of Appeals case, to be instructive here. 576 S.W.3d at 400.\n\n       In Cuevas, a peace officer was off duty, working as a security guard and enforcing\n\na \u201chouse rule,\u201d when appellant assaulted him. Id. at 399. The court of criminal appeals\n\nheld that it was \u201cimmaterial\u201d that the officer was enforcing a house rule, \u201cthat he was not\n\ntrying to arrest Appellant, and that Appellant was not subject to prosecution for\n\n\n                                             6\n\fviolating . . . any other law,\u201d because \u201c[a] peace officer may discharge an official duty even\n\nif it is also a private duty, and a person may be liable for assault on a public servant even\n\nif he is not subject to arrest for some other crime when he commits the assault.\u201d Id. at\n\n400. The court upheld appellant\u2019s conviction of assault on a public servant. Id.\n\n       Here, Deputy Ruiz testified that he was at Oralia\u2019s residence in response to a call\n\nabout a domestic disturbance involving appellant, discharging his duties. After Deputy\n\nRuiz identified himself, appellant threatened to \u201cf[-]ck [him] up,\u201d and then kicked him\n\nfollowing Deputy Ruiz\u2019s attempts to get appellant to voluntarily leave the premises.\n\nDeputy Ruiz also sought to prevent further destruction of Oralia\u2019s property, noting the\n\nbroken planter that Oralia had attributed to appellant. \u201cIt is the duty of every peace officer\n\nto preserve the peace within the officer\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN.\n\nart. 2.13(a); see also id. art. 6.06 (\u201cWhenever, in the presence of a peace officer, or within\n\nhis view, one person is about to commit an offense against the person or property of\n\nanother, including the person or property of his spouse, or injure himself, it is his duty to\n\nprevent it . . . .\u201d). As was the case in Cuevas, it is of no consequence that appellant may\n\nnot have been \u201csubject to arrest for some other crime when he commit[ted] the assault.\u201d\n\nSee Cuevas, 576 S.W.3d at 400. Because Deputy Ruiz, at the time of appellant\u2019s actions,\n\nwas performing his peace officer duties, the factfinder could reasonably infer that, in\n\nharming Deputy Ruiz when and in the manner in which he did, appellant had the intent to\n\nharm a public servant. See Edward, 635 S.W.3d at 655; Cuevas, 576 S.W.3d at 400. We\n\noverrule appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\nC.     Retaliation\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       1.     Applicable Law\n\n       \u201cA person commits the felony offense of retaliation if he intentionally or knowingly\n\nharms or threatens to harm another by an unlawful act in retaliation for the service or\n\nstatus of another as a public servant.\u201d Cada v. State, 334 S.W.3d 766, 770 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2011); see TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 36.06(a)(1)(A). Whether a particular statement\n\nconstitutes a threat is governed by an objective standard\u2014\u201cwhether a reasonable person\n\nwould foresee that the statement would be interpreted\u201d as a serious expression of intent\n\nto harm or assault by those to whom the maker made the statement. Brock v. State, 495\n\nS.W.3d 1, 17 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2016, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cComments can be evaluated as threats\n\nbased, not just on the language used, but also the context within which they are uttered,\n\neven veiled threats.\u201d Id. \u201cThe test is whether a threat would justify apprehension by an\n\nordinary hearer, not whether the threat communicated . . . caused a particular recipient\n\nto actually become apprehensive.\u201d See id.\n\n       2.     Analysis\n\n       As with his sufficiency challenge to the offense of assault on a public servant,\n\nappellant argues that he could not act in retaliation for or on the account of the service or\n\nstatus of a public servant when Deputy Ruiz was not \u201clawfully discharging his official duty\n\nby arresting [appellant] for a crime he was not committing.\u201d As we observed in Dodds v.\n\nState, No. 13-13-00288-CR, 2014 WL 6676774, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013\n\nEdinburg Nov. 25, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication), this Court\u2014\n\nas well as numerous sister courts\u2014have held that a retaliatory act need not be\n\ncontemporaneous with the public servant\u2019s performance of the public servant\u2019s official\n\n\n                                             8\n\fduties. That is, evidence of appellant\u2019s aggressive response to a self-identified peace\n\nofficer is sufficient to prove retaliatory intent beyond a reasonable doubt. See Nandin v.\n\nState, 402 S.W.3d 404, 408 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2013, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding evidence was\n\nsufficient to prove retaliatory intent because it showed defendant using an \u201caggressive\n\nposture, putting up his fists, and advancing towards the deputy who then pepper-sprayed\n\nhim in the face,\u201d which prompted defendant to charge the deputy and try to hit him).\n\n       Appellant does not dispute that Deputy Ruiz was a public servant, that he\n\nthreatened Deputy Ruiz, or that he kicked Deputy Ruiz after threatening him. See Cada,\n\n334 S.W.3d at 770. The jury was further entitled to believe Deputy Ruiz\u2019s testimony\u2014\n\nnamely, that he was a public servant, appellant threatened to \u201cf[-]ck\u201d him up if he took a\n\nstep further onto the property, and appellant kicked him repeatedly, during which\n\nappellant reiterated his prior threats to harm Deputy Ruiz\u2014which were consistent in all\n\nimportant respects. Based on this evidence, a rational factfinder could have found that\n\nappellant\u2019s statement was a threat to harm Deputy Ruiz, in retaliation for, or on account,\n\nof Deputy Ruiz\u2019s status as a public servant. See id.; see also Trejo v. State, No. 13-16-\n\n00432-CR, 2018 WL 5534107, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg Oct. 25, 2018,\n\npet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (concluding evidence was sufficient\n\nto support retaliation charge where officer arrived at appellant\u2019s home in response to a\n\ncall for assistance, and upon meeting appellant, appellant threatened that if the officer did\n\nnot leave, \u201che was going to call his buddies to have him killed or he would kill [the officer]\n\nhimself\u201d). We overrule appellant\u2019s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                                     III.   VOIR DIRE\n\n       Appellant next argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nchallenges for cause to four venire members: 10, 11, 41, and 58\u2014each with law\n\nenforcement ties.\n\nA.     Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       The purpose of voir dire is in part to elicit information that would establish a basis\n\nfor a challenge for cause because the venire member is legally disqualified from serving\n\nor is biased or prejudiced for or against one of the parties or some aspect of the relevant\n\nlaw.

App. 2005). \u201cA juror who\n\nstates that he cannot consider the minimum punishment for a particular statutory offense\n\nis subject to a challenge for cause.\u201d Cardenas v. State, 325 S.W.3d 179, 185 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2010); see TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 35.16(a) (\u201cA challenge for cause is an\n\nobjection made to a particular juror, alleging some fact which renders the juror incapable\n\nor unfit to serve on the jury.\u201d). \u201cWhere a party wishes to exclude a juror because of bias,\n\nit is the party seeking exclusion who must demonstrate, through questioning, that the\n\npotential juror lacks impartiality.\u201d Buntion v. State, 482 S.W.3d 58, 84 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2016); see Tracy v. State, 597 S.W.3d 502, 512 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020). \u201cThe opposing\n\nparty or trial judge may then examine the juror further to ensure that he fully understands\n\nand appreciates the position that he is taking, but unless there is further clarification or\n\nvacillation by the juror, the trial judge must grant a challenge for cause.\u201d Cardenas, 325\n\nS.W.3d at 185. \u201cA trial judge\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause may be reversed only for a\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fclear abuse of discretion.\u201d Tracy, 597 S.W.3d at 512; see Jacobs v. State, 560 S.W.3d\n\n205, 211 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018).\n\n       To preserve an objection to the denial of a challenge for cause, a defendant must\n\nhave: (1) used all his peremptory strikes, (2) asked for and was denied additional\n\nperemptory strikes, and (3) accepted an identified objectionable juror whom defendant\n\nwould not otherwise have accepted had the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s challenge\n\nfor cause (or granted him additional peremptory strikes so that he might strike the juror).\n\nBuntion, 482 S.W.3d at 83; Chambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 22 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993);\n\nsee TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 35.15 (b) (\u201cIn non-capital felony cases . . . , the State\n\nand defendant shall each be entitled to ten peremptory challenges.\u201d). To establish harm\n\nfor an erroneous denial of a challenge for cause, the defendant must show on the record\n\nthat he used a peremptory strike to remove the venireperson and thereafter suffered a\n\ndetriment from the loss of the strike. Comeaux v. State, 445 S.W.3d 745, 750 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2014); Chambers, 866 S.W.2d at 23.\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       The record demonstrates that appellant: (1) failed to use a peremptory strike on\n\ntwo of the four complained-of venire members; (2) failed to exhaust all of his peremptory\n\nstrikes; (3) failed to request more peremptory strikes; and (4) failed to identify\n\nobjectionable venire members who sat on the jury and on whom appellant would have\n\nremoved had the trial court allowed for more peremptory strikes. The jury was\n\nsubsequently empaneled without objection from appellant, and none of the objected-to\n\nvenire members served on the panel. Cf. Dukes v. State, 486 S.W.3d 170, 176 (Tex.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, no pet.) (providing that the defendant preserved error by\n\nobjecting \u201cto the empanelment of several jurors on whom he claimed he would have used\n\nperemptory challenges had his challenges for cause been granted or had he received the\n\nadditional strikes that he had requested\u201d); see also Tillman v. State, No. 14-98-01233-\n\nCR, 2001 WL 543666, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] May 24, 2001, pet. ref\u2019d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (defendant preserved error when he requested\n\nand was denied ten additional peremptory strikes after the clerk called the names of the\n\njurors but before they were sworn). Thus, appellant has failed to preserve error for our\n\nreview. See Comeaux, 445 S.W.3d at 750 (\u201cThe steps to preserve error and establish\n\nharm are intended to allow the trial judge every opportunity to correct error and to allow\n\nthe defendant to demonstrate that he did not have the benefit of using his peremptory\n\nchallenges in the way that he desired.\u201d); Chambers, 866 S.W.2d at 23. We overrule\n\nappellant\u2019s third issue.\n\n                                 IV.    DENIAL OF MISTRIAL\n\n       Appellant argues by his fourth issue that \u201c[t]he trial court improperly denied [his]\n\nrequest for a mistrial after the jury contravened its instructions.\u201d\n\nA.     Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,\n\nand we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling if it is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nArchie v. State, 340 S.W.3d 734, 738 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \u201c\u2018[We] view[] the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling, considering only those arguments\n\nbefore the court at the time of the ruling.\u2019\u201d Gonzalez v. State, 608 S.W.3d 98, 107 (Tex.\n\n\n                                              12\n\fApp.\u2014San Antonio 2020, pet. ref\u2019d) (quoting Ocon v. State, 284 S.W.3d 880, 884 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2009)). A mistrial is appropriate only in extreme cases of highly prejudicial\n\nerror when spending any further time or effort on trial \u201cwould be wasteful and futile.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, 608 S.W.3d at 108 (quoting Ocon, 284 S.W.3d at 884). Because mistrial is an\n\nextreme remedy, less drastic alternatives may suffice, such as instructing the jury to\n\nconsider as evidence only the testimony and exhibits admitted through witnesses on the\n\nstand or questioning the jury about the extent of any prejudice. Jenkins v. State, 493\n\nS.W.3d 583, 612 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). Ordinarily, we assume that a jury follows the\n\ninstruction given, and we will not reverse in the absence of evidence that the jury was\n\nactually confused by the charge. See Williams v. State, 937 S.W.2d 479, 490 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996). The movant has the burden of proving the allegation of juror misconduct.\n\nHughes v. State, 24 S.W.3d 833, 842 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      Here, appellant moved for a mistrial after the attorneys received a jury note during\n\njury guilt/innocence deliberations. The following colloquy ensued:\n\n      THE COURT:              What we have is a question from the jury that says\n                              [\u2018C]an we do the punishment phase today[?\u2019][ 2] I don\u2019t\n                              know exactly if there\u2019s anything implicit in that or not,\n                              but my proposal is to send them a note back that simply\n                              says before I can address your question you must\n                              render a verdict on\u2014you must render a verdict on the\n                              issue of innocence or guilt.\n\n      [STATE]:                That makes sense.\n\n      THE COURT:              Is there an objection from that response to the\n                              Defense?\n\n      2 The jury note contained a file stamp of June 14, 2022, at 5:06 p.m.\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       [DEFENDANT]:         Judge, I object. First, I move for a mistrial. The jury has\n                            wholly disregarded your instructions of the Jury Charge\n                            by even talking about punishment. And, second, I think\n                            you should be a little more adamant in your response\n                            to them. You know, something along the lines of, you\n                            know, it\u2019s not appropriate for you at this time to be\n                            discussing punishment or something along those lines.\n                            I\u2019ll let you be the author of that. But I think yours is\n                            just\u2014I think you\u2019re letting them off the hook. It\u2019s not\n                            right what they\u2019re doing, and I re-urge my mistrial.\n                            That\u2019s just not right. They have already made a\n                            decision and they haven\u2019t told you what the decision is.\n\n       THE COURT:           Right. They haven\u2019t even told me if they have a\n                            decision. Yes. I understand.\n\n       [DEFENDANT]:         Right. Exactly. If they don\u2019t have a decision then this is\n                            wholly inappropriate.\n\n       THE COURT:           It may be that they have reached a decision. They\u2019re\n                            just not understanding the process. And so what I\u2019m\n                            going to do, I\u2019ll write it out and then I\u2019ll tell you on the\n                            record what I\u2019m going to do.\n\n       [DEFENDANT]:         Okay.\n\n       THE COURT:           So what I need to do, Ms. Ruiz, if you will file this. You\n                            can tape it to a larger sheet if you want to. And if you\n                            will file stamp this and I will send that to them. You are\n                            allowed to let them read it and then tell them you want\n                            that note back. If they have any other notes or if they\n                            have a verdict or whatever, they can do that. But what\n                            you want to do is let them read it and then tell them that\n                            you need that note back.\n\n       The trial court\u2019s written response to the jury, containing a file stamp of June 14,\n\n2022, at 5:10 p.m. read as follows: \u201cLadies and [g]entlemen of the jury: It is not appropriate\n\nto address any procedural issue at this time. At this time, the only issue which may be\n\naddressed is the issue of innocence or guilt as presented to you in the Court[\u2019]s Charge.\u201d\n\n\n                                             14\n\fThe jury thereafter indicated it had reached a verdict and returned a guilty verdict form\n\ncontaining a file stamp of June 14, 2022, at 5:15 p.m.\n\n       Although the record shows that appellant initially moved for a mistrial based on\n\njury confusion or impropriety, neither was in fact later established. Indeed, it is not clear\n\nunder these facts that the jury had not yet reached its verdict regarding innocence at the\n\ntime it sent out the note at 5:05 p.m. inquiring about when punishment would occur\n\nbecause within five minutes of receiving the trial court\u2019s instruction to focus only on\n\nguilt/innocence\u2014not punishment, it returned a guilty verdict. See Gamboa v. State, 296\n\nS.W.3d 574, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Thrift v. State, 176 S.W.3d 221, 224 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2005); see also Wood v. State, No. 02-22-00197-CR, 2023 WL 7037617, at *9 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Fort Worth Oct. 26, 2023, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication)\n\n(concluding the denial of motion for mistrial was appropriate where the trial court\n\nresponded to the alleged impropriety by instructing the jurors they \u201cwere permitted to\n\nreceive evidence \u2018only in open court\u2019\u201d and that \u201cno juror is permitted to communicate to\n\nany other juror anything he or she may have heard regarding the case or any witness\n\ntherein, from any other source than open court\u201d); Guerra v. State, No. 08-22-00183-CR,\n\n2023 WL 5508829, at *10 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso Aug. 25, 2023, no pet.) (mem. op., not\n\ndesignated for publication) (\u201c[B]ecause the record does not support the factual predicate\n\nof her claim, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in denying her request for\n\na mistrial during the guilt/innocence phase of trial.\u201d). This record does not reflect that any\n\njuror \u201cengaged in such misconduct that the defendant did not receive a fair and impartial\n\ntrial.\u201d See TEX. R. APP. P. 21.3(g). Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse\n\n\n                                             15\n\fits discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for mistrial based on the jury note. We\n\noverrule appellant\u2019s fourth issue.\n\n                              V.     JUDGMENT MODIFICATION\n\n       By his fifth issue, appellant argues that the judgment does not reflect that his\n\nsentence for assault on a public servant is to run concurrently with his sentence for\n\nretaliation, rendering the judgment void. However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nhas already expressly concluded otherwise. See Ex parte Carter, 521 S.W.3d 344, 347\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2017). \u201cAn improper cumulation order may be remedied by reformation\n\non appeal or, in the proper circumstance, a judgment nunc pro tunc. Because the\n\nimproper cumulation order is subject to such remedies, the sentences cannot properly be\n\ndeclared void.\u201d Id. (internal citations omitted); see also Schorre v. State, No. 13-23-00142-\n\nCR, 2023 WL 7860784, at *1\u20132 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg Nov. 16, 2023, no\n\npet. h.) (mem. op., not designated for publication). (concluding modification of the\n\njudgment to show concurrence is permissible on appeal). An appellate court has the\n\npower to correct and reform the judgment of the court below to make the record speak\n\nthe truth when it has the necessary data and information to do so, or make any\n\nappropriate order as the law and the nature of the case may require. Bigley v. State, 865\n\nS.W.2d 26, 27\u201328 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993); Simmons v. State, 672 S.W.3d 821, 829 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2023, no pet.); see TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(b) (permitting the\n\nintermediate courts of appeals to \u201cmodify the trial court\u2019s judgment and affirm it as\n\nmodified\u201d).\n\n       The State agrees that the trial court orally ordered the sentences to run\n\n\n                                             16\n\fconcurrently when it sentenced appellant, and an oral pronouncement can be found in\n\nthe record of the adjudication hearing. We therefore modify the judgment to reflect the\n\nsentences are to run concurrently. We overrule appellant\u2019s fifth issue.\n\n                                   VI.

PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 22.01, 36.06, both third-degree felonies\n\nenhanced by appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions. See id. \u00a7 12.42(d). By five issues\n\nappellant argues (1)\u2013(2) the evidence is legally insufficient to support his convictions;\n\f(3) the trial court improperly denied his request to strike four venire members for cause;\n\n(4) \u201c[t]he trial court improperly denied [appellant\u2019s] request for a mistrial after the jury\n\ncontravened its instructions\u201d; and (5) the judgment is void as it does not comport with the\n\nsentence assessed by the trial court. We affirm as modified.\n\n                                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant was indicted on one count of assault on a public servant and one count\n\nof retaliation. He pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.\n\n       At trial, appellant\u2019s sister Oralia Garcia testified that she called the police in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 24, 2020, after appellant showed up at her doorstep around\n\n2 or 3 a.m., barefoot and shirtless, refusing to leave. Oralia stated that when she greeted\n\nappellant at the door, he demanded that she bring him something to drink. She retreated\n\ninside the home while he remained on the porch \u201cpraying and singing.\u201d Oralia testified\n\nthat she returned with a glass of water, and appellant then requested another drink. Upon\n\nreturning with the second drink, appellant took the drink and then picked up a planter off\n\nthe porch and threw it towards Oralia. Oralia quickly shut the front door to avoid getting\n\nhit with the planter. According to Oralia, there was nothing she had said or done prior to\n\nescalate the situation. Because appellant \u201ckept hitting the door\u201d and refused to leave,\n\nOralia called the police.\n\n       Oralia clarified that, at the time, appellant resided in a small trailer on her property,\n\nsituated behind her home, where she supports him financially. Oralia explained that it was\n\nnot unusual for appellant to appear on her doorstep demanding food or something to\n\ndrink, but appellant\u2019s timing and destructive behavior on this particular evening was\n\n\n                                               2\n\funusual. Oralia testified she briefly left the front porch area when officers arrived, and she\n\nreturned several minutes later to find appellant on the ground getting arrested. On cross-\n\nexamination, Oralia recalled hearing an officer instruct appellant to return to his trailer,\n\nand then later, Oralia heard appellant say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Oralia denied\n\nwitnessing the officer draw his weapon or taser.\n\n       DeWitt County Sheriff\u2019s Officer Juan Julian Ruiz Jr. testified that he was on patrol\n\non July 24, 2020, when he was dispatched to the residence. Deputy Ruiz stated he arrived\n\nto find appellant sitting on a porch swing shirtless and with only one shoe on. Deputy Ruiz\n\nidentified himself as law enforcement. \u201cAs I was walking up, he told me not to take another\n\nstep further. . . . He was going to f[-]ck me up,\u201d testified Deputy Ruiz. Deputy Ruiz, who\n\nwas familiar with appellant, testified that appellant appeared more aggravated than usual\n\nand \u201cjust wasn\u2019t himself,\u201d noting appellant\u2019s \u201cpinprick\u201d-sized pupils and suspecting\n\nappellant to be \u201cunder the influence of some kind of narcotics or alcoholic beverage.\u201d\n\n       After speaking with Oralia, Deputy Ruiz instructed appellant \u201cseveral times that he\n\nneed[ed] to go home\u201d and warned appellant that he would be arrested if he did not leave\n\nthe premises.

Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,\n\nand we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling if it is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nArchie v.

The following colloquy ensued:\n\n      THE COURT:              What we have is a question from the jury that says\n                              [\u2018C]an we do the punishment phase today[?\u2019][ 2] I don\u2019t\n                              know exactly if there\u2019s anything implicit in that or not,\n                              but my proposal is to send them a note back that simply\n                              says before I can address your question you must\n                              render a verdict on\u2014you must render a verdict on the\n                              issue of innocence or guilt.\n\n      [STATE]:                That makes sense.\n\n      THE COURT:              Is there an objection from that response to the\n                              Defense?\n\n      2 The jury note contained a file stamp of June 14, 2022, at 5:06 p.m.\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       [DEFENDANT]:         Judge, I object. First, I move for a mistrial. The jury has\n                            wholly disregarded your instructions of the Jury Charge\n                            by even talking about punishment. And, second, I think\n                            you should be a little more adamant in your response\n                            to them. You know, something along the lines of, you\n                            know, it\u2019s not appropriate for you at this time to be\n                            discussing punishment or something along those lines.\n                            I\u2019ll let you be the author of that. But I think yours is\n                            just\u2014I think you\u2019re letting them off the hook. It\u2019s not\n                            right what they\u2019re doing, and I re-urge my mistrial.\n                            That\u2019s just not right. They have already made a\n                            decision and they haven\u2019t told you what the decision is.\n\n       THE COURT:           Right. They haven\u2019t even told me if they have a\n                            decision. Yes. I understand.\n\n       [DEFENDANT]:         Right. Exactly. If they don\u2019t have a decision then this is\n                            wholly inappropriate.\n\n       THE COURT:           It may be that they have reached a decision. They\u2019re\n                            just not understanding the process. And so what I\u2019m\n                            going to do, I\u2019ll write it out and then I\u2019ll tell you on the\n                            record what I\u2019m going to do.\n\n       [DEFENDANT]:         Okay.\n\n       THE COURT:           So what I need to do, Ms. Ruiz, if you will file this. You\n                            can tape it to a larger sheet if you want to. And if you\n                            will file stamp this and I will send that to them. You are\n                            allowed to let them read it and then tell them you want\n                            that note back. If they have any other notes or if they\n                            have a verdict or whatever, they can do that. But what\n                            you want to do is let them read it and then tell them that\n                            you need that note back.\n\n       The trial court\u2019s written response to the jury, containing a file stamp of June 14,\n\n2022, at 5:10 p.m. read as follows: \u201cLadies and [g]entlemen of the jury: It is not appropriate\n\nto address any procedural issue at this time. At this time, the only issue which may be\n\naddressed is the issue of innocence or guilt as presented to you in the Court[\u2019]s Charge.\u201d\n\n\n                                             14\n\fThe jury thereafter indicated it had reached a verdict and returned a guilty verdict form\n\ncontaining a file stamp of June 14, 2022, at 5:15 p.m.\n\n       Although the record shows that appellant initially moved for a mistrial based on\n\njury confusion or impropriety, neither was in fact later established. Indeed, it is not clear\n\nunder these facts that the jury had not yet reached its verdict regarding innocence at the\n\ntime it sent out the note at 5:05 p.m. inquiring about when punishment would occur\n\nbecause within five minutes of receiving the trial court\u2019s instruction to focus only on\n\nguilt/innocence\u2014not punishment, it returned a guilty verdict.

See TEX.\n\nPROP. CODE ANN. \u00a7 24.002. By two issues, Steed argues (1) that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction because title to the subject property was necessarily at issue,\n\fand (2) that the trial court erred because he previously obtained a temporary restraining\n\norder (TRO) that \u201cbarred\u201d the foreclosure sale of the subject property.

BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant\u2019s mother, Janet Steed, was the sole owner of the property located on\n\nDorsal Street in Corpus Christi, Texas. On March 23, 2012, Janet executed a home equity\n\nconversion mortgage on the home, commonly called a reverse mortgage, 1 including a\n\nnote in the amount of $495,000 and an \u201cAdjustable Rate Home Equity Conversion Deed\n\nof Trust\u201d. The deed of trust listed \u201cJanet K. Steed\u201d as \u201cBorrower,\u201d the aforementioned\n\nproperty as \u201cthe Property,\u201d and Generation Mortgage Company, the successor in interest\n\nto Nationstar Mortgage LLC, d/b/a Champion Mortgage Company (Champion), as\n\n\u201cLender.\u201d It stated in pertinent part:\n\n       22. Foreclosure; Power of Sale. It is the express intention of Lender and\n       Borrower that Lender shall have a fully enforceable lien on the Property. It\n       is also the express intention of Lender and Borrower that Lender\u2019s default\n       remedies shall include the most expeditious means of foreclosure available\n       by applicable law, including, without limitation, foreclosure under a power of\n       sale. . . .\n\n       If the Property is sold pursuant to this Paragraph 22, Borrower or any person\n       holding possession of the Property through Borrower shall immediately\n       surrender possession of the Property to the purchaser at that sale.

Onewest Bank, FSB, 513 S.W.3d 103, 105 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no pet.) (citing J.\nAlton Alsup, The New & Improved Texas Reverse Mortgage, 55 CONSUMER FIN. L.Q. REP. 207, 209 (2001)).\n                                                  2\n\fand in February 2019, Champion filed suit against Janet\u2019s heirs, including Steed, to\n\nforeclose on the property. On July 15, 2020, Champion obtained a final judgment in district\n\ncourt allowing foreclosure. However, Steed challenged the foreclosure in a separate\n\ndistrict court action and obtained a TRO effective August 31, 2021, which prevented the\n\nforeclosure sale from taking place.\n\n       The mortgage remained in default. In the proceeding in which the TRO was issued,\n\nthe district court entered an agreed judgment on April 11, 2022, which dismissed Steed\u2019s\n\nclaim against Champion and allowed Champion to proceed with foreclosure. On August\n\n2, 2022, HB1 purchased the property during the foreclosure sale. On September 6, 2022,\n\nHB1 filed the instant forcible-detainer action in justice court seeking immediate\n\npossession of the property. An eviction notice was delivered to Steed on September 8,\n\n2022. Steed did not appear, and the justice court entered a default judgment of eviction\n\nin favor of HB1.\n\n       Steed appealed the default judgment, and the county court held a de novo bench\n\ntrial on November 14, 2022. Steed contended (1) that the TRO issued in August 2021\n\nwas still in effect and should have prevented the foreclosure sale from taking place; (2) he\n\nnever agreed to, nor had any notice of, the agreed judgment in his district court case\n\nagainst Champion; and (3) he was never notified of the subsequent foreclosure sale on\n\nAugust 2, 2022.\n\n       At trial, Steed explained that the property was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in\n\nAugust 2017. He testified that Janet submitted an insurance claim to repair the home, but\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fthe money was never received, and the repairs were never made. 2 He explained that the\n\npending insurance claim prevented him from buying the home after it went into default,\n\nand the purpose of the TRO in his district court case was to give one year for the insurance\n\ncompany to pay Champion and then for Champion to \u201cpay [him] to get the work taken\n\ncar[e] of\u201d on the house. He argued that he still had rightful possession of the home\n\nbecause the insurance money had never been issued and the TRO was still in effect. He\n\nalso claimed that neither he nor his lawyer consented to the agreed judgment, insinuating\n\nthat it was fraudulent.\n\n       The parties referenced the TRO multiple times, but it was not admitted into\n\nevidence. Quoting the TRO, Steed stated: \u201c[Champion] is hereby immediately enjoined\n\nfrom the date of entry of this order until [fourteen] days after or until further order of this\n\ncourt.\u201d Steed argued that this language meant that the TRO was still in effect since there\n\nwas no \u201cfurther order\u201d of the court. HB1 argued that there was no evidence that the\n\noriginal TRO was effective for longer than fourteen days, and there was no evidence that\n\nthe TRO had become a temporary injunction. HB1 further argued that even if the TRO\n\nwas in effect for longer than fourteen days, the agreed judgment rendered on April 11,\n\n2022, was a \u201cfurther order\u201d and would have terminated the TRO. HB1 also argued that\n\nregardless of whether Steed was notified of the agreed judgment by his lawyer, the court\n\nrecords indicated that it was signed by Steed\u2019s attorney.\n\n       Finally, HB1 argued that any issue Steed had with notice of the foreclosure sale\n\nwas irrelevant to who had the immediate right of possession of the property. The trial\n\n\n\n       2 Steed did not provide a copy of the insurance claim during trial.\n\n                                                    4\n\fcourt admitted three exhibits offered by HB1 to prove its right to immediate possession of\n\nthe property: (1) a copy of the substitute trustee\u2019s deed, evidencing the foreclosure sale\n\nand HB1\u2019s purchase of the property; (2) a copy of Janet Steed\u2019s reverse mortgage with\n\nChampion; (3) \u201ca copy of a [n]otice of [i]ntent to file a business record affidavit along with\n\nthat business record affidavit,\u201d which included a notice to vacate that was mailed to\n\nSteed. 3\n\n        On November 29, 2022, the trial court entered final judgment and awarded HB1\n\npossession of the property. This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.       SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n\n        By his first issue, Steed argues that the justice court did not have subject matter\n\njurisdiction to grant HB1 possession of the property, and that the county court did not\n\nhave jurisdiction over a trial de novo, because adjudication of HB1\u2019s forcible-detainer\n\nclaim required resolution of a title dispute.\n\nA.

To establish superior right to possession, the plaintiff must show (1) the\n\nplaintiff owns the property, (2) the party occupying the property is a tenant at sufferance,\n\n\n         3 To demand possession of real property, the person entitled to possession of the property must\n\nmake a written demand for possession and comply with Texas Property Code \u00a7 24.005\u2019s requirements for\na notice to vacate. See TEX. PROP.

(citations omitted).\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       Steed argues that the agreed judgment is void because his lawyer\u2019s signature was\n\nforged. Steed argues that the allegedly forged agreement creates a \u201cgenuine issue of title\n\nso intertwined with the issue of possession as to preclude\u201d the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nSee Yarbrough, 455 S.W.3d at 283.\n\n       Steed cites Yarbrough v. Household Finance Corp. III for the proposition that an\n\nallegation of forgery deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction. See id. In Yarbrough,\n\nHousehold Finance filed a forcible-detainer action to evict Ruby and Wilburn Yarbrough\n\nfrom the subject property. Id. at 278. Household Finance purchased the property at a non-\n\njudicial foreclosure sale and obtained a substitute trustee\u2019s deed. Id. The justice court\n\ngranted Household Finance possession of the property, and the Yarbroughs appealed to\n\nthe county court. Id. at 278\u201379. In that proceeding, the Yarbroughs \u201cfiled a plea to the\n\njurisdiction and an amended plea alleging that the foreclosure sale was void because the\n\ndeed of trust was forged and void.\u201d Id. at 279. With the amended plea, the couple filed an\n\naffidavit from Ruby, in which she testified that the deed of trust was not signed by her or\n\nher husband. Id. The Yarbroughs also filed \u201ca copy of their petition in a Texas district\n\ncourt\u201d against the original mortgagee in which the Yarbroughs \u201csought damages for\n\nwrongful eviction, slander of title, . . . [and] a judgment for title to the property.\u201d Id. The\n\ncourt held in favor of the Yarbroughs and found that the trial court lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction. Id. at 283.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f        Steed argues that his case \u201craises precisely the same question\u201d as Yarbrough\n\nbecause the forged agreed judgment creates a title dispute to preclude the trial court\u2019s\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction. However, Steed has not filed any of the documents that were\n\ncritical to the court\u2019s holding in Yarbrough. For example, Steed has no concurrent district\n\ncourt actions against HB1 or Champion, and Steed has not filed an affidavit testifying that\n\nthe agreed judgment contains a forged signature. 4 See Yarbrough, 455 S.W.3d at 279;\n\nYarto v. Gilliland, 287 S.W.3d 83, 95 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2009, no pet.)\n\n(\u201c[W]e find that the Gillilands\u2019 claim [that they entered an oral contract with Yarto and fully\n\nsatisfied the terms of the oral contract], coupled with the Gillilands\u2019 pending litigation in\n\nthe district court, raises a title dispute that removes the justice court\u2019s subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over the case.\u201d).\n\n        Furthermore, the court also analogized the Yarbrough\u2019s claims \u201cto those in which\n\nthe parties disputed the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship.\u201d Id. at 282. Appellate\n\ncourts generally find that a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction in a forcible-detainer\n\naction when the party asserting possession has established a landlord-tenant or tenant-\n\nat-sufferance relationship. See Rice, 51 S.W.3d at 711, 712\u201313 (holding that the trial court\n\nhad subject matter jurisdiction because appellants did not contest the validity of the deed\n\nof trust, which established a tenancy-at-sufferance relationship); Yarbrough, 455 S.W.3d\n\nat 280 (\u201cWhen there is no dispute that the parties agreed to a tenancy relationship in the\n\nevent of foreclosure, the tenancy relationship provides an independent basis for resolving\n\n\n       4 Steed filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to File Documents and Evidence in Support of Appeal\u201d with this\n\nCourt which included an affidavit alleging that his lawyer signed the agreed judgment without his consent.\nWe denied this motion because it included evidence outside the record and did not consider this affidavit\non appeal.\n                                                    8\n\fthe issue of possession.\u201d (citing Rice, 51 S.W.3d at 712)); see also Haywood v.

(holding that the trial court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over the forcible-detainer action because appellee failed to provide a\n\ndeed of trust establishing a landlord-tenant relationship with the appellant and appellant\n\nhad a concurrent case in federal district court against the original mortgagee); cf. Ward,\n\n115 S.W.3d at 271 (holding that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe forcible-detainer action because appellees\u2019 contract for deed did not establish a\n\nlandlord-tenant or tenancy-at-sufferance relationship).\n\n       The court in Yarbrough held that \u201c[b]ecause the Yarbroughs contend the deed of\n\ntrust and resulting substitute trustee\u2019s deed are void due to forgery, they have raised a\n\ngenuine issue of title so intertwined with the issue of possession as to preclude jurisdiction\n\nin the justice court.\u201d Yarbrough, 455 S.W.3d at 283. Here, HB1 produced the substitute\n\ntrustee\u2019s deed, evidencing HB1 owned the property, and the deed of trust executed\n\nbetween Janet and Champion which explicitly created a tenancy-at-sufferance\n\nrelationship with Janet and her heirs in the event of foreclosure. In contrast to Yarbrough,\n\nSteed has not challenged the validity of the deed of trust.\n\n       Because HB1 produced a deed of trust establishing a tenant-at-sufferance\n\nrelationship and Steed does not challenge the validity of that document, we hold that the\n\ntrial court had subject matter jurisdiction. See Yarbrough, 455 S.W.3d at 283; Rice, 51\n\nS.W.3d at 711, 712\u201313; see also Haywood, 2023 WL 4940543, at *4; Diffley, WL\n\n6790043, at *2; cf.

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\n       By his second issue, Steed argues the trial court erred in granting possession to\n\nHB1 because the purported TRO issued in August 2021 was still in effect and voided any\n\neffects of the foreclosure sale.\n\nA.     Standard of Review & Applicable Law\n\n       A forcible-detainer action is the procedure used to determine \u201cthe right to\n\nimmediate possession of real property.\u201d Yarto, 287 S.W.3d at 89 (citing Ward, 115 S.W.3d\n\nat 270). As explained previously, the sole issue in a forcible-detainer action is the right to\n\nimmediate possession of real property. Shields Ltd. P\u2019ship, 526 S.W.3d at 478.\n\n       Generally, any defects in the foreclosure process may not be considered in a\n\nforcible-detainer action. See, e.g., Schlichting v. Lehman Bros. Bank FSB, 346 S.W.3d\n\n196, 199 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2011, pet. dism\u2019d). Because the possessor or defendant can\n\nstill challenge the foreclosure in an adjudication of title, the plaintiff can establish\n\npossession over the subject property \u201ceven when \u2018the possessor questions the validity of\n\na foreclosure sale.\u2019\u201d Trimble v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortg. Ass\u2019n, 516 S.W.3d 24, 29 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2016, pet. denied) (quoting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Ezell, 410\n\nS.W.3d 919, 921 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2013, no pet.)).\n\nB.     TRO in the Appellate Record\n\n       We first address HB1\u2019s complaint that the TRO is improperly attached to Steed\u2019s\n\nbrief. The TRO was never admitted as an exhibit, and it is not included in the reporter\u2019s\n\nrecord or clerk\u2019s record. Steed attached the TRO as an appendix to his appellate brief,\n\nbut \u201c[i]t is well established that documents attached to an appellate brief which are not\n\n\n                                             10\n\fpart of the record may generally not be considered by the appellate court.\u201d Robb v.\n\nHorizon Cmtys. Improvement Ass\u2019n, 417 S.W.3d 585, 589 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2013, no\n\npet.) (collecting cases). The only evidence of the TRO that exists in the record is when\n\nSteed quotes from it during trial. Accordingly, the only portion of the TRO we will consider\n\nis the language, \u201c[Champion] is hereby immediately enjoined from the date of entry of this\n\norder until [fourteen] days after or until further order of this court.\u201d\n\nC.     Analysis\n\n       Steed argues that the August 2021 TRO did not expire because there was no\n\n\u201cfurther order\u201d from the district court, and therefore, he is entitled to possession of the\n\nproperty because the foreclosure was void. Essentially, Steed argues that the TRO could\n\nnot automatically expire after fourteen days and could only be terminated by \u201cfurther\n\norder\u201d of the court. Additionally, he also argues that the agreed judgment that terminated\n\nhis case against Champion cannot be a \u201cfurther order\u201d of the court because he had no\n\nnotice of it and his attorney\u2019s signature was forged.\n\n       First, from the plain meaning of the quoted language, Steed\u2019s interpretation of the\n\nTRO\u2019s durational language fails. Steed\u2019s interpretation would render the fourteen-day\n\ntime limit meaningless, and the TRO would not be \u201ctemporary.\u201d Second, Texas Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 687 sets out specific requirements for a writ of injunction and\n\nsubsection (e) clearly \u201climits any temporary restraining order to fourteen days.\u201d In re Tex.\n\nNat. Res. Conservation Comm\u2019n, 85 S.W.3d 201, 204 (Tex. 2002) (orig. proceeding); see\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 687.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f        Moreover, Steed does not argue that the TRO became a temporary injunction, or\n\nthat the district court extended the TRO in any way. See In re Tex. Nat. Res. Conservation\n\nComm\u2019n, 85 S.W.3d 201, 204\u201305 (Tex. 2002) (orig. proceeding) (stating that Rule 680 is\n\n\u201cthe only method for extending a temporary restraining order beyond fourteen days\u201d); see\n\nalso TEX. R. CIV. P. 680 (providing that a TRO cannot exceed fourteen days unless the\n\ncourt extends it for good cause \u201cwithin the time so fixed [in] the order\u201d and providing that\n\na TRO may not be extended more than once \u201cunless subsequent extensions are\n\nunopposed\u201d). Thus, Steed has failed to show that the TRO issued in August 2021 was\n\nstill in effect and prevented the property\u2019s foreclosure in August 2022. 5\n\n        Lastly, Steed argues in his reply brief that \u201c[a]ppellees acted in bad faith, committed\n\nperjury, fraud and fraud upon the courts, but not limited thereto, to steal the property from\n\n[Steed]\u201d and thereby violated Texas Constitution Article 16, \u00a7 50. See TEX. CONST. art.\n\n16, \u00a7 50(a) (\u201cProtection of Homestead from Forced or Unauthorized Sale\u201d). Steed\n\ninsinuates that Champion, who is not a party to this lawsuit, and HB1 both violated the\n\nTexas Constitution because the insurance money for the damage sustained in 2017 was\n\nnever paid out and the property was never repaired.\n\n        First, a party may not raise a new issue in a reply brief.

By two issues, Steed argues (1) that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction because title to the subject property was necessarily at issue,\n\fand (2) that the trial court erred because he previously obtained a temporary restraining\n\norder (TRO) that \u201cbarred\u201d the foreclosure sale of the subject property. We affirm.\n\n                                     I.        BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant\u2019s mother, Janet Steed, was the sole owner of the property located on\n\nDorsal Street in Corpus Christi, Texas. On March 23, 2012, Janet executed a home equity\n\nconversion mortgage on the home, commonly called a reverse mortgage, 1 including a\n\nnote in the amount of $495,000 and an \u201cAdjustable Rate Home Equity Conversion Deed\n\nof Trust\u201d. The deed of trust listed \u201cJanet K. Steed\u201d as \u201cBorrower,\u201d the aforementioned\n\nproperty as \u201cthe Property,\u201d and Generation Mortgage Company, the successor in interest\n\nto Nationstar Mortgage LLC, d/b/a Champion Mortgage Company (Champion), as\n\n\u201cLender.\u201d It stated in pertinent part:\n\n       22. Foreclosure; Power of Sale. It is the express intention of Lender and\n       Borrower that Lender shall have a fully enforceable lien on the Property. It\n       is also the express intention of Lender and Borrower that Lender\u2019s default\n       remedies shall include the most expeditious means of foreclosure available\n       by applicable law, including, without limitation, foreclosure under a power of\n       sale. . . .\n\n       If the Property is sold pursuant to this Paragraph 22, Borrower or any person\n       holding possession of the Property through Borrower shall immediately\n       surrender possession of the Property to the purchaser at that sale. If\n       possession is not surrendered, Borrower or such person shall be tenants at\n       sufferance and may be removed by writ of possession.\n\n       Janet defaulted on the loan at some point before her death in 2018. Champion\n\nsent notice of default to Janet\u2019s estate on September 12, 2018. Default was never cured,\n\n\n\n        1 \u201cA reverse mortgage allows homeowners, age [sixty-two] or older, to convert home equity into\n\nperiodic payments or advances made by the lender over the life of the homeowners.\u201d Washington-Jarmon\nv.

REP. 207, 209 (2001)).\n                                                  2\n\fand in February 2019, Champion filed suit against Janet\u2019s heirs, including Steed, to\n\nforeclose on the property. On July 15, 2020, Champion obtained a final judgment in district\n\ncourt allowing foreclosure. However, Steed challenged the foreclosure in a separate\n\ndistrict court action and obtained a TRO effective August 31, 2021, which prevented the\n\nforeclosure sale from taking place.\n\n       The mortgage remained in default. In the proceeding in which the TRO was issued,\n\nthe district court entered an agreed judgment on April 11, 2022, which dismissed Steed\u2019s\n\nclaim against Champion and allowed Champion to proceed with foreclosure. On August\n\n2, 2022, HB1 purchased the property during the foreclosure sale. On September 6, 2022,\n\nHB1 filed the instant forcible-detainer action in justice court seeking immediate\n\npossession of the property. An eviction notice was delivered to Steed on September 8,\n\n2022. Steed did not appear, and the justice court entered a default judgment of eviction\n\nin favor of HB1.\n\n       Steed appealed the default judgment, and the county court held a de novo bench\n\ntrial on November 14, 2022. Steed contended (1) that the TRO issued in August 2021\n\nwas still in effect and should have prevented the foreclosure sale from taking place; (2) he\n\nnever agreed to, nor had any notice of, the agreed judgment in his district court case\n\nagainst Champion; and (3) he was never notified of the subsequent foreclosure sale on\n\nAugust 2, 2022.\n\n       At trial, Steed explained that the property was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in\n\nAugust 2017. He testified that Janet submitted an insurance claim to repair the home, but\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fthe money was never received, and the repairs were never made. 2 He explained that the\n\npending insurance claim prevented him from buying the home after it went into default,\n\nand the purpose of the TRO in his district court case was to give one year for the insurance\n\ncompany to pay Champion and then for Champion to \u201cpay [him] to get the work taken\n\ncar[e] of\u201d on the house. He argued that he still had rightful possession of the home\n\nbecause the insurance money had never been issued and the TRO was still in effect. He\n\nalso claimed that neither he nor his lawyer consented to the agreed judgment, insinuating\n\nthat it was fraudulent.\n\n       The parties referenced the TRO multiple times, but it was not admitted into\n\nevidence. Quoting the TRO, Steed stated: \u201c[Champion] is hereby immediately enjoined\n\nfrom the date of entry of this order until [fourteen] days after or until further order of this\n\ncourt.\u201d Steed argued that this language meant that the TRO was still in effect since there\n\nwas no \u201cfurther order\u201d of the court. HB1 argued that there was no evidence that the\n\noriginal TRO was effective for longer than fourteen days, and there was no evidence that\n\nthe TRO had become a temporary injunction. HB1 further argued that even if the TRO\n\nwas in effect for longer than fourteen days, the agreed judgment rendered on April 11,\n\n2022, was a \u201cfurther order\u201d and would have terminated the TRO. HB1 also argued that\n\nregardless of whether Steed was notified of the agreed judgment by his lawyer, the court\n\nrecords indicated that it was signed by Steed\u2019s attorney.\n\n       Finally, HB1 argued that any issue Steed had with notice of the foreclosure sale\n\nwas irrelevant to who had the immediate right of possession of the property. The trial\n\n\n\n       2 Steed did not provide a copy of the insurance claim during trial.\n\n                                                    4\n\fcourt admitted three exhibits offered by HB1 to prove its right to immediate possession of\n\nthe property: (1) a copy of the substitute trustee\u2019s deed, evidencing the foreclosure sale\n\nand HB1\u2019s purchase of the property; (2) a copy of Janet Steed\u2019s reverse mortgage with\n\nChampion; (3) \u201ca copy of a [n]otice of [i]ntent to file a business record affidavit along with\n\nthat business record affidavit,\u201d which included a notice to vacate that was mailed to\n\nSteed. 3\n\n        On November 29, 2022, the trial court entered final judgment and awarded HB1\n\npossession of the property. This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.       SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n\n        By his first issue, Steed argues that the justice court did not have subject matter\n\njurisdiction to grant HB1 possession of the property, and that the county court did not\n\nhave jurisdiction over a trial de novo, because adjudication of HB1\u2019s forcible-detainer\n\nclaim required resolution of a title dispute.\n\nA.

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\n       By his second issue, Steed argues the trial court erred in granting possession to\n\nHB1 because the purported TRO issued in August 2021 was still in effect and voided any\n\neffects of the foreclosure sale.\n\nA.

The TRO was never admitted as an exhibit, and it is not included in the reporter\u2019s\n\nrecord or clerk\u2019s record.

App.\u2014El Paso 2013, no\n\npet.) (collecting cases). The only evidence of the TRO that exists in the record is when\n\nSteed quotes from it during trial. Accordingly, the only portion of the TRO we will consider\n\nis the language, \u201c[Champion] is hereby immediately enjoined from the date of entry of this\n\norder until [fourteen] days after or until further order of this court.\u201d\n\nC.     Analysis\n\n       Steed argues that the August 2021 TRO did not expire because there was no\n\n\u201cfurther order\u201d from the district court, and therefore, he is entitled to possession of the\n\nproperty because the foreclosure was void. Essentially, Steed argues that the TRO could\n\nnot automatically expire after fourteen days and could only be terminated by \u201cfurther\n\norder\u201d of the court. Additionally, he also argues that the agreed judgment that terminated\n\nhis case against Champion cannot be a \u201cfurther order\u201d of the court because he had no\n\nnotice of it and his attorney\u2019s signature was forged.\n\n       First, from the plain meaning of the quoted language, Steed\u2019s interpretation of the\n\nTRO\u2019s durational language fails. Steed\u2019s interpretation would render the fourteen-day\n\ntime limit meaningless, and the TRO would not be \u201ctemporary.\u201d Second, Texas Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 687 sets out specific requirements for a writ of injunction and\n\nsubsection (e) clearly \u201climits any temporary restraining order to fourteen days.\u201d In re Tex.\n\nNat. Res. Conservation Comm\u2019n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">85 S.W.3d 201</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204 (Tex. 2002) (orig. proceeding); see\n\nTEX. R. CIV.

See In re Tex. Nat. Res. Conservation\n\nComm\u2019n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">85 S.W.3d 201</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204\u201305 (Tex. 2002) (orig. proceeding) (stating that Rule 680 is\n\n\u201cthe only method for extending a temporary restraining order beyond fourteen days\u201d); see\n\nalso TEX. R. CIV. P. 680 (providing that a TRO cannot exceed fourteen days unless the\n\ncourt extends it for good cause \u201cwithin the time so fixed [in] the order\u201d and providing that\n\na TRO may not be extended more than once \u201cunless subsequent extensions are\n\nunopposed\u201d). Thus, Steed has failed to show that the TRO issued in August 2021 was\n\nstill in effect and prevented the property\u2019s foreclosure in August 2022. 5\n\n        Lastly, Steed argues in his reply brief that \u201c[a]ppellees acted in bad faith, committed\n\nperjury, fraud and fraud upon the courts, but not limited thereto, to steal the property from\n\n[Steed]\u201d and thereby violated Texas Constitution Article 16, \u00a7 50. See TEX. CONST. art.\n\n16, \u00a7 50(a) (\u201cProtection of Homestead from Forced or Unauthorized Sale\u201d). Steed\n\ninsinuates that Champion, who is not a party to this lawsuit, and HB1 both violated the\n\nTexas Constitution because the insurance money for the damage sustained in 2017 was\n\nnever paid out and the property was never repaired.\n\n        First, a party may not raise a new issue in a reply brief.
