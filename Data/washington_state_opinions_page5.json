Sept. 18, 2023).\n\n     Hood was arrested and charged after the effective date of Public Act 101-652 (eff. Jan. 1, 2023),\n\n     commonly known as the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act (Act). 1\n\n\n\n             1\n              \u201cThe Act has also sometimes been referred to in the press as the Pretrial Fairness Act. Neither\n     name is official, as neither appears in the Illinois Compiled Statutes or public act.\u201d Rowe v. Raoul, 2023 IL\n     129248, \u00b6 4 n. 1.\n\f     No. 1-23-1808B\n\n     For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64           Hood was charged by indictment with one count of the Class 2 felony of aggravated battery\n\n     of a peace officer, 720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2022), and one count of criminal trespass to\n\n     land, 720 ILCS 5/21-3(a)(2) (West 2022). At an October 4, 2023 hearing, he was granted pretrial\n\n     release with standard conditions,2 the requirement to report to the Adult Probation Department\u2019s\n\n     Pretrial Services Division and ordered to refrain from going to a local high school.\n\n\u00b65           Pursuant to section 5/110-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) (725 ILCS\n\n     5/110-6 (West 2022)), the State filed a petition for revocation of pretrial release. The petition\n\n     alleged that while on pretrial release in the instant case, Hood was charged with a new felony,\n\n     armed habitual criminal (AHC), 720 ILCS 24-1.7(a) (West 2022). The State asserted that \u201cno\n\n     condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the appearance of\n\n     [Hood] for later hearings [and] prevent [Hood] from being charged with a subsequent Felony or\n\n     Class A Misdemeanor.\u201d\n\n\u00b66           The court conducted a hearing on the petition on October 23. The State proceeded by\n\n     proffer, explaining that:\n\n                      \u201cthe case that\u2019s before you is case No. 23CR1095601. On that case, he is charged\n\n             with an aggravated battery to a police officer. The facts are that on October 3rd of 2023,\n\n             officers were dispatched to a fight between juveniles at North-Grand High School located\n\n             at 4338 West Wabansia Avenue.\n\n                      Officers approached the juveniles to break up a fight. One of the juveniles was\n\n             [Hood\u2019s] stepdaughter. [Hood] was on scene. And as the police approached [Hood\u2019s]\n\n\n             2\n               These conditions are to: appear in court, submit to the orders of the court, not violate any criminal\n     statute of any jurisdiction, and file a written notice within 24 hours after a change of address.\n\n                                                           2\n\fNo. 1-23-1808B\n\n       stepdaughter, [Hood] stepped in and interfered. He began pulling his stepdaughter away\n\n       from the police officer, and [Hood] then pushed Officer Pagan with two hands in the chest.\n\n       He was wearing full Chicago Police Department uniform and acting in his official duties\n\n       on that day.\n\n              ***\n\n              And at the time he also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43.\n\n              Judge, then [Hood] was again arrested October 19th. Officers responded. Officers\n\n       were dispatched to a call of a person trespassing at Harris Ice, located at 3927 West Fifth\n\n       Avenue.\n\n              ***\n\n              The caller described [Hood]. He was wearing acid washed jean jacket, sunglasses,\n\n       black hoodie, gray jeans and a baseball cap. Officers were also notified from the caller that\n\n       [Hood] was armed with a handgun.\n\n              He was in that location attempting to take dry ice from the business; however, he\n\n       then fled that location, and officers observed [Hood] matching the description that was\n\n       provided by the caller and placed [Hood] into custody and conducted a protective\n\n       pat-down, and officers then recovered a semi-automatic 45-caliber handgun with blue\n\n       finish\u2014it was loaded\u2014from [Hood]\u2019s left jacket pocket.\n\n              [Hood] was then relocated to the Harris Ice location and was positively identified\n\n       by the caller. [Hood] did not have a valid FOID or Concealed Carry License, and he was\n\n       previously convicted of a 2020 possession of a firearm\u2014excuse me, felon in possession of\n\n       a firearm.\u201d\n\nThe State expounded on Hood\u2019s criminal background, explaining he had a 2015 conviction for\n\naggravated battery in a public place, a 2012 conviction for manufacture or delivery of heroin, a\n\n                                                3\n\f     No. 1-23-1808B\n\n     2011 conviction for manufacture or delivery of cannabis, and a 2019 misdemeanor conviction for\n\n     domestic battery. The State indicated that at the time Hood was arrested in the instant matter, he\n\n     also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43. Hood was currently being detained on the\n\n     AHC charge. Further, the court had at its disposal the public safety assessment from pretrial\n\n     services which indicated that Hood (1) scored a 6 out of 6 on the \u201cnew criminal activity scale,\u201d\n\n     indicating that he was at the highest risk of reoffending, and (2) had three prior violent convictions.\n\n     Accordingly, the State argued that there were no set of conditions that would allow Hood to comply\n\n     with the Court\u2019s orders and prevent him from \u201cpicking up\u201d any further criminal cases.\n\n\u00b67          Defense counsel argued the petition should be denied and stated that Hood had complied\n\n     in the instant matter with reporting to pretrial services. Counsel further argued that Hood was\n\n     present at the school to pick up his stepdaughter, who is one of three children living with Hood\n\n     and his pregnant girlfriend. During the incident at issue, he was attempting to protect his\n\n     stepdaughter, who was on the ground after the police officer had separated two minors involved\n\n     in an altercation. In other mitigation, counsel argued that Hood is 42 years old, has been working\n\n     in refrigeration for several years, takes classes, and has an older daughter in college that he\n\n     supports. Further, Hood has attended Garfield Community Church for 10 years, where he\n\n     participates as a mentor in the youth camp program. Lastly, counsel informed the court that Hood\n\n     has some mental health diagnoses, for which he is currently taking medication.\n\n\u00b68          The court granted the State\u2019s petition for revocation of pretrial release, noting that Hood\n\n     had been charged with a Class X felony while on pretrial release for aggravated battery to a peace\n\n     officer. The court further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that no condition or\n\n     combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent Hood from being charged with a\n\n     subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor. Accordingly, the court ordered Hood to be detained\n\n     by the Cook County sheriff. On November 2, Hood filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                                       4\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b69                                                II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10           On appeal, Hood argues the trial court erred when it revoked his pretrial release because\n\n       electronic monitoring (EM) was sufficient to prevent him from committing any new offenses. The\n\n       State counters that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Hood\u2019s pretrial release\n\n       where the court found that Hood was charged with a subsequent felony while on pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case.\n\n\u00b6 11           In considering this appeal, this court has reviewed the following documents which Hood\n\n       and the State have submitted under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023): (1)\n\n       Hood\u2019s notice of appeal pursuant to the Act, (2) the supporting record, (3) Hood\u2019s supporting\n\n       memorandum, and (4) the State\u2019s response to Hood\u2019s memorandum.\n\n\u00b6 12                                          A. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 13           We initially note that the parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review. Hood\n\n       contends the standard of review is de novo, where the court considered only documentary\n\n       evidence. Nonetheless, Hood argues, reversal is required under any standard of review. The State\n\n       argues the applicable standard regarding revocation of pretrial release is abuse of discretion. We\n\n       agree with the State. To our knowledge, the appropriate standard of review for revocation of\n\n       pretrial release under section 5/110-6 of the Code has not been directly addressed by any appellate\n\n       or supreme court opinion. See People v. Reed, 2024 IL App (4th) 231074-U, \u00b6 22; People v. Smith,\n\n       2023 IL App (1st) 231756-U, \u00b6 23. However, as noted recently by a panel of the fourth district,\n\n                       \u201ceven in those jurisdictions adopting a mixed standard of review of a circuit court\u2019s\n\n               pretrial release decision under section 110-6/1, where, as here, the State must meet its\n\n               burdens by \u2018clear and convincing evidence,\u2019 court\u2019s acknowledge \u2018[t]he trial court\u2019s\n\n               pretrial release determination, modification of pretrial release determination, or revocation\n\n               of pretrial release determination will not be reversed unless the determination was an abuse\n\n                                                         5\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n              of discretion.\u2019 People v.

Sept. 18, 2023) have historically been reviewed using an abuse of\n\n       discretion standard. People v. Inman, 2023 IL App (4th) 230864, \u00b6 10. While Illinois Supreme\n\n       Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023) provides a new procedure for these types of appeals, \u201cthe\n\n       Act neither mandates nor suggests a different standard of review.\u201d Inman, 2023 IL App (4th)\n\n       230864, \u00b6 11.\n\n\u00b6 15          \u201cA defendant appealing under Rule 604(h) may claim the State failed to fulfill its burden\n\n       by \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 See Ill. S. Ct. R. 604(h)(1)(iii) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023). However,\n\n       we are not reviewing the State\u2019s evidence anew.\u201d Id. Rather, we review the circuit court\u2019s\n\n       evaluation of that evidence for an abuse of discretion, as \u201ca court\u2019s decisions regarding whether\n\n       the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that release conditions would not protect the\n\n       community is inextricably linked to any decision to grant or deny pretrial release.\u201d People v. Jones,\n\n       2023 IL App (4th) 230837.\n\n\u00b6 16          We believe the standard of review should be no different here, and therefore we apply an\n\n       abuse of discretion standard. An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court\u2019s \u201c \u2018ruling is\n\n       arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by\n\n       the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d In re Marriage of Heroy, 2017 IL 120205, \u00b6 24 (quoting Blum v.

Revocation of Pretrial Release\n\n\u00b6 18           Pursuant to the Code, \u201cit is presumed that a defendant is entitled to release on personal\n\n       recognizance on the condition that the defendant shall attend all required court proceedings and\n\n       the defendant does not commit any criminal offense, and complies with all terms of pretrial\n\n       release.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-2(a) (West 2022). It is the State\u2019s burden to prove by clear and\n\n       convincing evidence that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably\n\n       ensure the appearance of the defendant for later hearings or prevent the defendant from being\n\n       charged with a subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-6(a) (West 2022).\n\n       Upon such a showing, the trial court may order a defendant detained if the defendant is charged\n\n       with a qualifying offense and the circuit court concludes the defendant poses a real and present\n\n       threat to the safety of any persons or the community. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(a)(1-7) (West 2022). If\n\n       the court finds that detention is not appropriate, it can impose additional conditions as it deems\n\n       necessary. 725 ILCS 5/110-10(b) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 19           If previously granted, \u201cpretrial release may be revoked only if the defendant is charged\n\n       with a felony or Class A misdemeanor that is alleged to have occurred during the defendant\u2019s\n\n       pretrial release after a hearing on the court\u2019s own motion or upon the filing of a verified petition\n\n       by the State.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-6(a) (West 2022). During a revocation hearing,\n\n       the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the nature and\n\n       seriousness of the violation or criminal act alleged.\u201d Id. If the court decides that revocation is not\n\n       appropriate, it \u201cmay release the defendant pre-trial, with or without modification of conditions of\n\n       pretrial release.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 20           For the following reasons, we do not believe the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n       determining that there were no conditions or combinations of conditions that could have prevented\n\n                                                         7\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n       Hood from being charged with a subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor. The record\n\n       demonstrates that the court relied on the fact that\u2014while on pretrial release in this case\u2014Hood\n\n       was arrested and charged with AHC, a Class X felony. As a condition of his pretrial release, Hood\n\n       was required to, inter alia, not violate any criminal statute of any jurisdiction. The trial court\n\n       specifically found that Hood was on pretrial release for case 23 CR 10956 when he allegedly\n\n       committed a Class X felony (case 23111321801), a mere two weeks after the instant offense\n\n       occurred. The record supports this conclusion. While Hood argues he complied with his pretrial\n\n       release restrictions, he points only to his compliance with the conditions that he report to pretrial\n\n       services and stay away from his stepdaughter\u2019s high school. He does not acknowledge his failure\n\n       to refrain from violating any criminal statute.\n\n\u00b6 21           Hood contends the court could have sufficiently minimized any risk he had of reoffending\n\n       by employing EM as a condition of release. Hood offers no more than a conclusory statement that\n\n       \u201c[b]ecause Jeffrey had not been previously placed on electronic monitoring (EM) and did not have\n\n       an apparent history of failures to appear, the State did not show that no conditions of release could\n\n       reasonably ensure his appearance.\u201d Further, Hood emphasizes the same mitigating factors\n\n       provided at his revocation hearing\u2014his role as a caretaker for his children and pregnant girlfriend,\n\n       his employment, his involvement in church, and the fact that he was taking classes. But none of\n\n       the mitigating factors Hood relies upon previously prevented him from violating his pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case when he was arrested for a serious felony. The State proffered clear and\n\n       convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably\n\n       prevent Hood from being charged with yet another subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n       Given Hood\u2019s criminal history, it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful for the trial court to\n\n       agree with the State. Consequently, we cannot say the circuit court erred when it revoked Hood\u2019s\n\n       pretrial release.\n\n                                                         8\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b6 22                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 23          Following a thorough review of the record on appeal, for the reasons stated, we find the\n\n       court did not err when it revoked Hood\u2019s pretrial release. The mandate in this case shall issue\n\n       immediately. See People v. Gil, 2019 IL App (1st) 192419, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 24          Affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 25   JUSTICE OCASIO III, dissenting:\n\n\u00b6 26          I respectfully dissent from the decision revoking Jeffrey Hood\u2019s pretrial release. As the\n\n       majority correctly recognizes, the State bore \u201cthe burden of proving, by clear and convincing\n\n       evidence, that no condition or combinations of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the\n\n       appearance of the defendant for later hearings or prevent the defendant from being charged with a\n\n       subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-6(a) (West Supp. 2023). One of the\n\n       conditions of release contemplated by the new pretrial-release provisions is that the defendant be\n\n       placed on \u201cpretrial home supervision *** with or without the use of an approved electronic\n\n       monitoring device.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-10(b)(5) (West Supp. 2023). Hood argues that the trial court\n\n       erred by jumping straight to revocation rather than ordering home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring as a condition of his release. The majority rejects this argument as conclusory, but that\n\n       gets it backwards: Hood did not have the burden of showing that home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring was adequate; the State had the burden of showing that it was not. The facts proffered\n\n       by the State showed that both the underlying charge and the new charge that prompted the\n\n       revocation hearing involved alleged offenses that took place in public, not in the home. The State\u2019s\n\n       proffer included no information indicating that home confinement with electronic monitoring\n\n       would not reasonably ensure that Hood committed no further crimes. In the absence of any\n\n       indication that home confinement with electronic monitoring was either unavailable or inadequate\n\n       under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s finding that the State had met its burden by\n\n                                                        9\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n       clear and convincing evidence is arbitrary and unreasonable. I would therefore find that the trial\n\n       court abused its discretion.\n\n\u00b6 27          The trial court failed to articulate the reasons for its decision. At the end of the revocation\n\n       hearing, the Court stated:\n\n                          \u201cThe defendant on the case before me has a pending case, and\n                      this Court finds that based on a petition from the State requesting\n                      revocation and based on what I have heard in the hearing that the\n                      defendant, while on pretrial release, did, in fact, pick up a new\n                      charge of armed\u2014I believe it's armed habitual but I want to make\n                      sure that's the correct charge\u2014armed habitual criminal, which is a\n                      Class X felony, while on bond for this aggravated battery to a peace\n                      officer, and that it occurred while on his pretrial release.\n                          The Court further finds that by clear and convincing evidence\n                      that no condition or conditions at this moment release would be\n                      reasonable to prevent him from being charged with another\n                      subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n                          It is therefore ordered that the defendant's pretrial release in this\n                      case be revoked and he be remanded to the Cook County Jail under\n                      further order of this Court.\u201d\n\n       The court\u2019s written revocation order is a form with checkboxes. It adds nothing to what was said\n\n       in open court, and it provides no insight into why the court determined there were no conditions\n\n       or combinations of conditions for ensuring that he would not be charged with another offense. In\n\n       short, the record shows us that the trial court found that the standard for revocation had been met,\n\n       but it does not tell us either why or how. Without an explanation for why the court found as it\n\n       did, we cannot conduct a \u201cmeaningful review of its exercise of discretion.\u201d People v. Ortega,\n\n       209 Ill. 2d 354, 360 (2004).\n\n\u00b6 28          Furthermore, as a matter of procedural fairness, the accused is entitled to an explanation as\n\n       to why a judge has ordered him to be detained. A statement of reasons is a requirement of\n\n       procedural due process at proceedings to revoke parole and probation even after a defendant has\n\n       been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Morrisey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972);\n\n                                                         10\n\fNo. 1-23-1808B\n\nGagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973). I cannot fathom why revocation of pretrial\n\ndetention, at which time the accused is still cloaked with a presumption of innocence, would not\n\nrequire at least as much. See State v. Burgins, 464 S.W.3d 298, 310 n.7 (Tenn. 2015). Indeed, this\n\ndue-process protection is expressly provided for in the statute that governs denials of pretrial\n\nrelease. When entering a detention order, the statute requires the trial court to explain in writing\n\nits \u201creasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied pretrial release, including why less\n\nrestrictive conditions\u201d would not be adequate. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(h)(1) (West Supp. 2023).\n\nWhether that provision also governs revocation proceedings is an open question that we have not\n\nbeen asked to answer in this appeal.

BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64           Hood was charged by indictment with one count of the Class 2 felony of aggravated battery\n\n     of a peace officer, 720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(d)(4) (West 2022), and one count of criminal trespass to\n\n     land, 720 ILCS 5/21-3(a)(2) (West 2022). At an October 4, 2023 hearing, he was granted pretrial\n\n     release with standard conditions,2 the requirement to report to the Adult Probation Department\u2019s\n\n     Pretrial Services Division and ordered to refrain from going to a local high school.\n\n\u00b65           Pursuant to section 5/110-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) (725 ILCS\n\n     5/110-6 (West 2022)), the State filed a petition for revocation of pretrial release. The petition\n\n     alleged that while on pretrial release in the instant case, Hood was charged with a new felony,\n\n     armed habitual criminal (AHC), 720 ILCS 24-1.7(a) (West 2022). The State asserted that \u201cno\n\n     condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the appearance of\n\n     [Hood] for later hearings [and] prevent [Hood] from being charged with a subsequent Felony or\n\n     Class A Misdemeanor.\u201d\n\n\u00b66           The court conducted a hearing on the petition on October 23. The State proceeded by\n\n     proffer, explaining that:\n\n                      \u201cthe case that\u2019s before you is case No. 23CR1095601. On that case, he is charged\n\n             with an aggravated battery to a police officer. The facts are that on October 3rd of 2023,\n\n             officers were dispatched to a fight between juveniles at North-Grand High School located\n\n             at 4338 West Wabansia Avenue.\n\n                      Officers approached the juveniles to break up a fight. One of the juveniles was\n\n             [Hood\u2019s] stepdaughter. [Hood] was on scene. And as the police approached [Hood\u2019s]\n\n\n             2\n               These conditions are to: appear in court, submit to the orders of the court, not violate any criminal\n     statute of any jurisdiction, and file a written notice within 24 hours after a change of address.\n\n                                                           2\n\fNo. 1-23-1808B\n\n       stepdaughter, [Hood] stepped in and interfered. He began pulling his stepdaughter away\n\n       from the police officer, and [Hood] then pushed Officer Pagan with two hands in the chest.\n\n       He was wearing full Chicago Police Department uniform and acting in his official duties\n\n       on that day.\n\n              ***\n\n              And at the time he also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43.\n\n              Judge, then [Hood] was again arrested October 19th. Officers responded. Officers\n\n       were dispatched to a call of a person trespassing at Harris Ice, located at 3927 West Fifth\n\n       Avenue.\n\n              ***\n\n              The caller described [Hood]. He was wearing acid washed jean jacket, sunglasses,\n\n       black hoodie, gray jeans and a baseball cap. Officers were also notified from the caller that\n\n       [Hood] was armed with a handgun.\n\n              He was in that location attempting to take dry ice from the business; however, he\n\n       then fled that location, and officers observed [Hood] matching the description that was\n\n       provided by the caller and placed [Hood] into custody and conducted a protective\n\n       pat-down, and officers then recovered a semi-automatic 45-caliber handgun with blue\n\n       finish\u2014it was loaded\u2014from [Hood]\u2019s left jacket pocket.\n\n              [Hood] was then relocated to the Harris Ice location and was positively identified\n\n       by the caller. [Hood] did not have a valid FOID or Concealed Carry License, and he was\n\n       previously convicted of a 2020 possession of a firearm\u2014excuse me, felon in possession of\n\n       a firearm.\u201d\n\nThe State expounded on Hood\u2019s criminal background, explaining he had a 2015 conviction for\n\naggravated battery in a public place, a 2012 conviction for manufacture or delivery of heroin, a\n\n                                                3\n\f     No. 1-23-1808B\n\n     2011 conviction for manufacture or delivery of cannabis, and a 2019 misdemeanor conviction for\n\n     domestic battery. The State indicated that at the time Hood was arrested in the instant matter, he\n\n     also had a pending misdemeanor battery in Branch 43. Hood was currently being detained on the\n\n     AHC charge. Further, the court had at its disposal the public safety assessment from pretrial\n\n     services which indicated that Hood (1) scored a 6 out of 6 on the \u201cnew criminal activity scale,\u201d\n\n     indicating that he was at the highest risk of reoffending, and (2) had three prior violent convictions.\n\n     Accordingly, the State argued that there were no set of conditions that would allow Hood to comply\n\n     with the Court\u2019s orders and prevent him from \u201cpicking up\u201d any further criminal cases.\n\n\u00b67          Defense counsel argued the petition should be denied and stated that Hood had complied\n\n     in the instant matter with reporting to pretrial services. Counsel further argued that Hood was\n\n     present at the school to pick up his stepdaughter, who is one of three children living with Hood\n\n     and his pregnant girlfriend. During the incident at issue, he was attempting to protect his\n\n     stepdaughter, who was on the ground after the police officer had separated two minors involved\n\n     in an altercation. In other mitigation, counsel argued that Hood is 42 years old, has been working\n\n     in refrigeration for several years, takes classes, and has an older daughter in college that he\n\n     supports. Further, Hood has attended Garfield Community Church for 10 years, where he\n\n     participates as a mentor in the youth camp program. Lastly, counsel informed the court that Hood\n\n     has some mental health diagnoses, for which he is currently taking medication.\n\n\u00b68          The court granted the State\u2019s petition for revocation of pretrial release, noting that Hood\n\n     had been charged with a Class X felony while on pretrial release for aggravated battery to a peace\n\n     officer. The court further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that no condition or\n\n     combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent Hood from being charged with a\n\n     subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor. Accordingly, the court ordered Hood to be detained\n\n     by the Cook County sheriff. On November 2, Hood filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                                       4\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b69                                                II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 10           On appeal, Hood argues the trial court erred when it revoked his pretrial release because\n\n       electronic monitoring (EM) was sufficient to prevent him from committing any new offenses. The\n\n       State counters that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Hood\u2019s pretrial release\n\n       where the court found that Hood was charged with a subsequent felony while on pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case.\n\n\u00b6 11           In considering this appeal, this court has reviewed the following documents which Hood\n\n       and the State have submitted under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023): (1)\n\n       Hood\u2019s notice of appeal pursuant to the Act, (2) the supporting record, (3) Hood\u2019s supporting\n\n       memorandum, and (4) the State\u2019s response to Hood\u2019s memorandum.\n\n\u00b6 12                                          A. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 13           We initially note that the parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review. Hood\n\n       contends the standard of review is de novo, where the court considered only documentary\n\n       evidence. Nonetheless, Hood argues, reversal is required under any standard of review. The State\n\n       argues the applicable standard regarding revocation of pretrial release is abuse of discretion. We\n\n       agree with the State. To our knowledge, the appropriate standard of review for revocation of\n\n       pretrial release under section 5/110-6 of the Code has not been directly addressed by any appellate\n\n       or supreme court opinion.

The record\n\n       demonstrates that the court relied on the fact that\u2014while on pretrial release in this case\u2014Hood\n\n       was arrested and charged with AHC, a Class X felony. As a condition of his pretrial release, Hood\n\n       was required to, inter alia, not violate any criminal statute of any jurisdiction. The trial court\n\n       specifically found that Hood was on pretrial release for case 23 CR 10956 when he allegedly\n\n       committed a Class X felony (case 23111321801), a mere two weeks after the instant offense\n\n       occurred. The record supports this conclusion. While Hood argues he complied with his pretrial\n\n       release restrictions, he points only to his compliance with the conditions that he report to pretrial\n\n       services and stay away from his stepdaughter\u2019s high school. He does not acknowledge his failure\n\n       to refrain from violating any criminal statute.\n\n\u00b6 21           Hood contends the court could have sufficiently minimized any risk he had of reoffending\n\n       by employing EM as a condition of release. Hood offers no more than a conclusory statement that\n\n       \u201c[b]ecause Jeffrey had not been previously placed on electronic monitoring (EM) and did not have\n\n       an apparent history of failures to appear, the State did not show that no conditions of release could\n\n       reasonably ensure his appearance.\u201d Further, Hood emphasizes the same mitigating factors\n\n       provided at his revocation hearing\u2014his role as a caretaker for his children and pregnant girlfriend,\n\n       his employment, his involvement in church, and the fact that he was taking classes. But none of\n\n       the mitigating factors Hood relies upon previously prevented him from violating his pretrial release\n\n       in the instant case when he was arrested for a serious felony. The State proffered clear and\n\n       convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably\n\n       prevent Hood from being charged with yet another subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n       Given Hood\u2019s criminal history, it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful for the trial court to\n\n       agree with the State. Consequently, we cannot say the circuit court erred when it revoked Hood\u2019s\n\n       pretrial release.\n\n                                                         8\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n\u00b6 22                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 23          Following a thorough review of the record on appeal, for the reasons stated, we find the\n\n       court did not err when it revoked Hood\u2019s pretrial release. The mandate in this case shall issue\n\n       immediately. See People v. Gil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4636340\"><a href=\"/opinion/4832561/people-v-gil/\">2019 IL App (1st) 192419</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 24          Affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 25   JUSTICE OCASIO III, dissenting:\n\n\u00b6 26          I respectfully dissent from the decision revoking Jeffrey Hood\u2019s pretrial release. As the\n\n       majority correctly recognizes, the State bore \u201cthe burden of proving, by clear and convincing\n\n       evidence, that no condition or combinations of conditions of release would reasonably ensure the\n\n       appearance of the defendant for later hearings or prevent the defendant from being charged with a\n\n       subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-6(a) (West Supp. 2023). One of the\n\n       conditions of release contemplated by the new pretrial-release provisions is that the defendant be\n\n       placed on \u201cpretrial home supervision *** with or without the use of an approved electronic\n\n       monitoring device.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/110-10(b)(5) (West Supp. 2023). Hood argues that the trial court\n\n       erred by jumping straight to revocation rather than ordering home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring as a condition of his release. The majority rejects this argument as conclusory, but that\n\n       gets it backwards: Hood did not have the burden of showing that home confinement with electronic\n\n       monitoring was adequate; the State had the burden of showing that it was not. The facts proffered\n\n       by the State showed that both the underlying charge and the new charge that prompted the\n\n       revocation hearing involved alleged offenses that took place in public, not in the home. The State\u2019s\n\n       proffer included no information indicating that home confinement with electronic monitoring\n\n       would not reasonably ensure that Hood committed no further crimes. In the absence of any\n\n       indication that home confinement with electronic monitoring was either unavailable or inadequate\n\n       under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s finding that the State had met its burden by\n\n                                                        9\n\f       No. 1-23-1808B\n\n       clear and convincing evidence is arbitrary and unreasonable. I would therefore find that the trial\n\n       court abused its discretion.\n\n\u00b6 27          The trial court failed to articulate the reasons for its decision. At the end of the revocation\n\n       hearing, the Court stated:\n\n                          \u201cThe defendant on the case before me has a pending case, and\n                      this Court finds that based on a petition from the State requesting\n                      revocation and based on what I have heard in the hearing that the\n                      defendant, while on pretrial release, did, in fact, pick up a new\n                      charge of armed\u2014I believe it&#x27;s armed habitual but I want to make\n                      sure that&#x27;s the correct charge\u2014armed habitual criminal, which is a\n                      Class X felony, while on bond for this aggravated battery to a peace\n                      officer, and that it occurred while on his pretrial release.\n                          The Court further finds that by clear and convincing evidence\n                      that no condition or conditions at this moment release would be\n                      reasonable to prevent him from being charged with another\n                      subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\n                          It is therefore ordered that the defendant&#x27;s pretrial release in this\n                      case be revoked and he be remanded to the Cook County Jail under\n                      further order of this Court.\u201d\n\n       The court\u2019s written revocation order is a form with checkboxes. It adds nothing to what was said\n\n       in open court, and it provides no insight into why the court determined there were no conditions\n\n       or combinations of conditions for ensuring that he would not be charged with another offense. In\n\n       short, the record shows us that the trial court found that the standard for revocation had been met,\n\n       but it does not tell us either why or how. Without an explanation for why the court found as it\n\n       did, we cannot conduct a \u201cmeaningful review of its exercise of discretion.\u201d People v.

A statement of reasons is a requirement of\n\n       procedural due process at proceedings to revoke parole and probation even after a defendant has\n\n       been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

I cannot fathom why revocation of pretrial\n\ndetention, at which time the accused is still cloaked with a presumption of innocence, would not\n\nrequire at least as much. See State v. Burgins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">464 S.W.3d 298</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 n.7 (Tenn. 2015). Indeed, this\n\ndue-process protection is expressly provided for in the statute that governs denials of pretrial\n\nrelease. When entering a detention order, the statute requires the trial court to explain in writing\n\nits \u201creasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied pretrial release, including why less\n\nrestrictive conditions\u201d would not be adequate. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(h)(1) (West Supp. 2023).\n\nWhether that provision also governs revocation proceedings is an open question that we have not\n\nbeen asked to answer in this appeal. But even if it does not, the defendant still has a right to know\n\nwhy the trial court found as it did. In my view, due process of law\u2014not to mention fundamental\n\nfairness\u2014requires no less.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108785/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2118941/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2161608/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4239832/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4636340/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4636448/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9409445/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9896538/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9899913/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9905717/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925458/", "id": 9925458, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467620/people-v-quintero/", "cluster_id": 9467620, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467620/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T13:04:23.572038-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T13:33:51.936396-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "e8ecbc81b04317eb168e04c95d33f697631857fd", "page_count": 11, "download_url": "https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/resources/eab8326d-61b6-42bc-a667-98126eaaaa8a/file", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/people_v._quintero.pdf", "plain_text": "                                        2024 IL App (1st) 2129-U\n                                             No. 1-23-2129B\n                                      Order filed January 18, 2024\n                                                                                          Sixth Division\n\n\n NOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23 and is not precedent except in the\n limited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                                 IN THE\n                                  APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n                                            FIRST DISTRICT\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,                             )   Appeal from the\n                                                                  )   Circuit Court of\n           Plaintiff-Appellee,                                    )   Cook County.\n                                                                  )\n     v.                                                           )   No. 23 111251101\n                                                                  )\n EDWIN QUINTERO,                                                  )   Honorable\n                                                                  )   Maryam Ahmad,\n           Defendant-Appellant.                                   )   Judge, Presiding.\n\n\n\n           JUSTICE ODEN JOHNSON delivered the judgment of the court.\n           Justices C.A.

Sept. 18, 2023) challenging the trial court\u2019s order entered\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\non September 28, 2023, pursuant to what is commonly known as the Pretrial Fairness Act. 1\n\nDefendant was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing and damage\n\ngreater than $300, and aggravated assault of a peace officer with a motor vehicle. After hearing,\n\nthe trial court granted the State\u2019s petition to detain defendant, on a willful flight risk basis, and\n\ndenied defendant pretrial release. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on October 5, 2023,\n\nand a Rule 604(h) memorandum, and the State filed a memorandum in response. For the following\n\nreasons, we reverse and remand.\n\n\u00b63                                         BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64      A summary of the relevant evidence proffered by the parties during the hearing on the\n\nState\u2019s Petition for Detention is as follows: On September 27, 2023, officers received a license\n\nplate reader hit for a stolen vehicle and attempted to curb the vehicle. The vehicle did not stop until\n\nit subsequently crashed and became stuck between a wall and light pole. An officer exited his\n\nsquad car, walked in front of the crashed vehicle, and demanded that the occupants exit the vehicle.\n\nAccording to the State, defendant was in the driver\u2019s seat. The vehicle then accelerated in the\n\ndirection of the officer but did not hit him. The front driver\u2019s side tire blew out. Another squad car\n\napproached the vehicle on the left side and a city work truck moved in front of the vehicle, making\n\nit difficult for the vehicle to drive away. At this point, defendant got out of the crashed vehicle and\n\nattempted to run but was detained within a half block of the vehicle. Defendant reportedly made\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          In 2021, the General Assembly passed two separate acts that \u201cdismantled and rebuilt Illinois\u2019s\nstatutory framework for the pretrial release of criminal defendants.\u201d Rowe v. Raoul, 2023 IL 129248, \u00b64\n(discussing Pub. Act 101-652, \u00a7 10-255, 102-1104, \u00a7 70 (eff. Jan. 1, 2023) (amending 725 ILCS 5/art.\n110) (the Pretrial Fairness Act) and Pub. Act 102-1104 (eff. Jan. 1, 2023) (the Follow-Up Act).\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\npost-Miranda statements indicating that while he knew the vehicle was stolen, he did not try to hit\n\nthe police officer.\n\n\u00b65      In mitigation, the defense proffered that defendant was 19 years old and a lifelong resident\n\nof Chicago. His mother and pregnant fianc\u00e9e, with whom he already had one child, were present\n\nin court during the detention hearing to support him. Defendant had completed three years of high\n\nschool, received a food handling certificate, and worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant.\n\n\u00b66      The State conceded that defendant had no punishable background. His entire criminal\n\nhistory consists of a pending minor traffic matter for failing to obey a traffic signal, and a dismissed\n\ndomestic battery case that resulted in an order of protection against him. He missed one traffic\n\ncourt date but had no failures to appear or violations on the order of protection. As such, he scored\n\na two for new criminal activity and a one for failure to appear on the pretrial services assessment.\n\n\u00b67      Nevertheless, the State argued that defendant had a high likelihood of willful flight because\n\nof his multiple attempts, during the instant encounter, to avoid arrest. Defendant responded that it\n\nwas improper to conflate alleged flight from police officers with intention to thwart the judicial\n\nprocess to avoid prosecution because the police officers are not members of the judiciary, and\n\nfurther that there were conditions that could be imposed short of detention.\n\n\u00b68      The trial court agreed with the State that \u201cflight from law enforcement officers is flight\n\nfrom prosecution because officers trigger the prosecution process.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court\n\nfound that defendant had a high likelihood of flight to elude prosecution and ordered that the\n\ndefendant be detained and remanded to the custody of the Cook County Sheriff pending trial. The\n\ntrial court then read defendant his rights and then noted for the record that \u201cno least restrictive\n\ncondition, based on these allegations, can ensure defendant\u2019s return to court or mitigate the risk to\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\npublic safety.\u201d The trial court further indicated in the detention order that no condition or\n\ncombination of conditions could mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight because \u201cdefendant has shown\n\nan inability to comply with the commands of law enforcement officers, in disregard of his safety,\n\nand others. He has also demonstrated his refusal (unless forced) to comply and accede to the\n\njudicial system.\u201d The trial court also stated that defendant posed a real and present threat to the\n\nsafety of any person or persons or the community because \u201cdefendant refused to comply with law\n\nenforcement officers; he crashed into a building and pole trying to flee and drove at an officer. It\n\ntook a city truck and another car to stop him.\u201d\n\n\u00b69     Defendant\u2019s appeal was timely filed within 14 days, thereby conferring jurisdiction upon\n\nthis court. In considering this appeal, we have reviewed the following documents that were\n\nsubmitted pursuant to Rule 604(h): defendant\u2019s Notice of Pretrial Fairness Act Appeal, defendant\u2019s\n\nsupporting memorandum, and the State\u2019s response memorandum.\n\n\u00b6 10                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 11   On appeal, defendant does not contest that the State met its burden of proving by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the proof was evident and the presumption great that he committed a\n\nqualifying offense or that the charges are detainable under 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022).\n\nInstead, defendant challenges whether the State met its burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that he had a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution and that no condition\n\nor combination of conditions could mitigate that risk. Id. \u00a7 5/110-6.1(e)(3). Defendant contends\n\nthat the legislature dramatically changed the statutory framework for pretrial release and in so\n\ndoing intentionally deleted the \u201cflight from arrest\u201d language of section 110-5(a) (725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n5(a) (West 2022)), but left \u201cflight from prosecution\u201d in section 110-1(f) (725 ILCS 5/110-1(f)\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\n(West 2022)). He contends that the change evidenced the legislature\u2019s intent to remove \u2018flight\n\nfrom arrest\u2019 as a consideration when determining pretrial release. Additionally, defendant contends\n\nthat the trial court erred in determining that no condition or combination of conditions would\n\nreasonably ensure his appearance for later hearings or prevent defendant from being charged with\n\na subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor; and in sua sponte considering whether defendant\n\nposed a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons or the community without a\n\nverified petition filed by the State on that basis.\n\n\u00b6 12    The State responds that defendant misstates the 2022 version of section 110-5(a) of the Act\n\nand instead refers to the 2021 version prior to its amendment. Additionally, the State contends\n\nthat the amendment to section 110-5(a) allows the trial court to consider the nature and seriousness\n\nof the risk of obstructing or attempting to obstruct the criminal justice process that would be posed\n\nby defendant\u2019s release, which would include his evasion of arrest. 725 ILCS 5/110-5(a)(5) (West\n\n2022). The State further contends that the Act does not list any factors to consider whether a\n\ndefendant has a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution, and the plain language of\n\nsection 110-5(a)(5) does not limit what facts the trial court can consider when making such a\n\ndetermination. Further, the State argues that it is irrelevant that a definition for willful flight was\n\nincluded in section 110-1(f) (725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West 2022)) because that term does not appear\n\nin section 110-5(a)(5). Based on the language contained in section 110-5(a)(5), the State contends\n\nthat the avoidance of arrest is included in the obstruction of or attempt to obstruct the criminal\n\njustice process because all cases subject to the Act are dependent upon arrest. Defendant\u2019s use of\n\nviolence and multiple attempts to avoid arrest, including twice trying to elude the police by car\n\nand once on foot, fully established that no conditions would mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\nwhere he did not place the safety of others above his own self-interest in avoiding arrest, hence\n\nproving that no conditions could mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight.\n\n\u00b6 13     However, the State agrees that the trial court erred in making a sua sponte finding that\n\ndefendant\u2019s continued detention was justified where he posed a real and present threat to the safety\n\nof any person or persons or the community because it did not file a verified petition setting forth\n\nthe grounds, including specific articulable facts, that defendant posed a real and present threat to\n\nthe safety of any person(s) or the community as required by 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(d)(1) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 14     Pretrial release is governed by Article 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963\n\n(Code) (725 ILCS 5/110-1 et seq (West 2022)). Under the Code, all persons charged with an\n\noffense are eligible for pretrial release before conviction. 725 ILCS 5/110-2(a) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 15     Pursuant to the Code, a defendant\u2019s pretrial release may be denied only in certain statutorily\n\nlimited situations. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022). Upon the State\u2019s filing of a verified petition\n\nrequesting denial of pretrial release, the State has the burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the proof is evident or the presumption great that the defendant has committed a\n\nqualifying offense, that the defendant\u2019s pretrial release poses a real and present threat to the safety\n\nof any person or the community or a flight risk, and that less restrictive conditions would not avoid\n\na real and present threat to the safety of any person or the community and or prevent the\n\ndefendant\u2019s willful flight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-2; 5/110-6.1(a)(1.5), (4), (8) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 16     At all pretrial hearings, the prosecution has the burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that any condition of release is necessary. 725 ILCS 5/110-2(b) (West 2022). In any order\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\nfor detention, the court shall make a written finding summarizing the court\u2019s reasons for\n\nconcluding that the defendant should be denied pretrial release, including why less restrictive\n\nconditions would not avoid a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons or the\n\ncommunity, based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or prevent the defendant\u2019s willful\n\nflight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(h)(1) (West 2022). Section 110-1(f) defines willful\n\nflight as \u201cintentional conduct with a purpose to thwart the judicial process to avoid prosecution;\n\nisolated instances of nonappearance in court alone are not evidence of the risk of willful flight;\n\nand reoccurrence and patterns of intentional conduct to evade prosecution and affirmative steps to\n\ncommunicate or remedy any missed court date can be considered. 725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 17     A circuit court\u2019s finding that the State presented clear and convincing evidence that\n\nmandatory conditions of release would fail to protect any person or the community, and/or that the\n\ndefendant had a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution, or that the defendant failed\n\nto comply with previous conditions of pretrial release thereby requiring a modification or\n\nrevocation of the previously issued conditions of pretrial release, will not be reversed unless those\n\nfindings are against the manifest weight of the evidence. People v. Vingara, 2023 IL App (5th)\n\n230698, \u00b6 10. \u201cA finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite\n\nconclusion is clearly evident or if the finding itself is unreasonable, arbitrary, or not based on the\n\nevidence presented.\u201d People v. Deleon, 227 Ill.2d 322, 332 (2008). Under this standard, we give\n\ndeference to the trial court as the finder of fact as it is in the best position to observe the conduct\n\nand demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d Deleon, 227 Ill. 2d at 332.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\n\u00b6 18    Here, the trial court based its decision to deny defendant pretrial release primarily on its\n\ndetermination that defendant posed a flight risk to avoid prosecution under the Act. The trial court\n\nemphasized and reiterated both orally and in the written order that \u201cflight from law enforcement\n\nofficers [was] flight from prosecution because officers trigger the prosecution process;\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendant has shown an inability to comply with the commands of law enforcement officers;\u201d\n\nand \u201cDefendant refused to comply with law enforcement officers[-] he crashed into a building and\n\npole trying to flee and drove at an officer.\u201d This was despite defendant\u2019s pretrial assessment score\n\nof one for failure to appear and two for new criminal activity. And, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s\n\nminimal criminal history, family support, and employment.\n\n\u00b6 19    We must therefore determine whether the trial court properly considered evading police\n\nduring arrest as \u201cwillful flight to avoid prosecution\u201d as contemplated by the Act.\n\n\u00b6 20    This is an issue of statutory interpretation which we review de novo. People v. Gutman,\n\n2011 IL 110338, \u00b6 12. The primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give\n\neffect to the legislature\u2019s intent. Id. The most reliable indicator of legislative intent is the language\n\nof the statute, given its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. We view the statute as a whole, construing\n\nwords and phrases in light of other relevant statutory provisions and not in isolation. Id. Each word,\n\nclause, and sentence of a statute must be given a reasonable meaning, if possible, and should not\n\nbe rendered superfluous. Id. The court may consider the reason for the law, the problems sought\n\nto be remedied, the purposes to be achieved, and the consequences of construing the statute one\n\nway or another. Id. Also, a court presumes that the legislature did not intend to create absurd,\n\ninconvenient, or unjust results. Id. Pursuant to the rule of lenity, ambiguous criminal statutes will\n\ngenerally be construed in the defendant\u2019s favor. Id. However, the rule of lenity is subordinate to\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\nour obligation to determine legislative intent, and it will not be construed so rigidly as to defeat\n\nlegislative intent. Id.\n\n\u00b6 21    As noted above, the trial court may deny pretrial release only after a hearing on verified\n\npetition filed by the State if the person has a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution\n\nand is charged with any felony described in subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this Section or a\n\nfelony offense other than a Class 4 offense. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(a)(8) (West 2022). Section 110-\n\n1(f) defines willful flight. 725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West 2022). However, section 110-5(a)(5) allows\n\nthe trial court to consider the nature and seriousness of the risk of obstructing or attempting to\n\nobstruct the criminal justice process that would be posed by defendant\u2019s release. 725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n5(a)(5) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 22    We do not find the language of the Act to be ambiguous and find that the legislature\u2019s\n\nintent can be ascertained from the plain language of the Act. Looking at section 5/110-6.1(a)(8) of\n\nthe Act, we find that its plain language, coupled with the definition of willful flight as found in\n\nsection 110-1(f) clearly refers to a defendant\u2019s willful avoidance of prosecution in court by failing\n\nto appear at court hearings and similar behaviors. Under a plain reading of this section, a defendant\n\nevading arrest would not trigger \u201cwillful flight from prosecution\u201d of section 110-6.1(a)(8) because\n\narrest does not equal prosecution; the prosecution of the offense has not begun. However, we do\n\nfind that the trial court could consider evasion of arrest under section 110-5(a)(5) of the Act when\n\nconsidering pretrial release as that section specifically refers to obstruction or the attempted\n\nobstruction of the criminal justice system that would be posed by defendant\u2019s release. Arrest is\n\nclearly part of the criminal justice system. Thus, we find that the trial court\u2019s consideration of\n\ndefendant\u2019s evasion of arrest was proper under the Act.\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\n\u00b6 23   Next, defendant contends that the State failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can mitigate his willful flight\n\nunder section 110-6.1(e)(3) of the Act (725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(e)(3) (West 2022)). He points to the\n\nState\u2019s failure to specifically address any one condition or any combination of conditions and why\n\nthose conditions would be insufficient.\n\n\u00b6 24   The State responds that defendant\u2019s use of violence and multiple attempts to avoid arrest,\n\nincluding twice trying to elude the police by car and once on foot fully established that no\n\nconditions would mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight where he did not place the safety of others\n\nabove his own self-interest in avoiding arrest.\n\n\u00b6 25   Section 110-6.1 of the Act (725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022)) provides that all defendants\n\nshall be presumed eligible for pretrial release and the State has to prove by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that no condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-\n\n10 can mitigate the defendant\u2019s willful flight for offenses listed in paragraph (8) of subsection (a).\n\nThat paragraph includes forcible felonies such as those defendant is charged with. Contrary to the\n\nState\u2019s assertion, the record does not indicate that the trial court considered any less restrictive\n\nmeans to pretrial detention. The Act requires that in any order for detention, the court shall make\n\na written finding summarizing the court\u2019s reasons for concluding that the defendant should be\n\ndenied pretrial release, including why less restrictive conditions would not avoid a real and present\n\nthreat to the safety of any person or persons or the community, based on the specific articulable\n\nfacts of the case, or prevent the defendant\u2019s willful flight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n6.1(h)(1) (West 2022). There is no evidence in the record that the trial court considered any\n\nalternatives to defendant\u2019s detention in violation of the Act; thus, we conclude that its order\n\n\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\ndenying pretrial release was an abuse of discretion and remand for consideration of defendant\u2019s\n\ndetention alternatives. In doing so, we are not making any finding that defendant is entitled to or\n\nmust receive pretrial release; we are remanding based on our finding that the record contains no\n\nevidence that the trial court considered any detention alternatives as required by the statute prior\n\nto ordering defendant\u2019s confinement.\n\n\u00b6 26    We also find that the portion of the trial court\u2019s detention order that concluded that\n\ndefendant\u2019s pretrial release posed a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons,\n\nor the community was error. As both parties agree, the State did not file a verified petition setting\n\nforth the grounds, including specific articulable facts, that defendant posed a real and present threat\n\nto the safety of any person(s) or the community, thus such finding was error, and we reverse that\n\nportion of the trial court\u2019s findings.\n\n\u00b6 27                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 28    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County\n\nrequiring defendant\u2019s pretrial detention entered on September 28, 2023, and remand for\n\nconsideration of defendant\u2019s detention alternatives. Mandate shall issue instanter.\n\n\u00b6 29    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                        2024 IL App (1st) 2129-U\n                                             No. 1-23-2129B\n                                      Order filed January 18, 2024\n                                                                                          Sixth Division\n\n\n NOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23 and is not precedent except in the\n limited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                                 IN THE\n                                  APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n                                            FIRST DISTRICT\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,                             )   Appeal from the\n                                                                  )   Circuit Court of\n           Plaintiff-Appellee,                                    )   Cook County.\n                                                                  )\n     v.                                                           )   No. 23 111251101\n                                                                  )\n EDWIN QUINTERO,                                                  )   Honorable\n                                                                  )   Maryam Ahmad,\n           Defendant-Appellant.                                   )   Judge, Presiding.\n\n\n\n           JUSTICE ODEN JOHNSON delivered the judgment of the court.\n           Justices C.A.

Sept. 18, 2023) challenging the trial court\u2019s order entered\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\non September 28, 2023, pursuant to what is commonly known as the Pretrial Fairness Act. 1\n\nDefendant was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing and damage\n\ngreater than $300, and aggravated assault of a peace officer with a motor vehicle. After hearing,\n\nthe trial court granted the State\u2019s petition to detain defendant, on a willful flight risk basis, and\n\ndenied defendant pretrial release. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on October 5, 2023,\n\nand a Rule 604(h) memorandum, and the State filed a memorandum in response. For the following\n\nreasons, we reverse and remand.\n\n\u00b63                                         BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64      A summary of the relevant evidence proffered by the parties during the hearing on the\n\nState\u2019s Petition for Detention is as follows: On September 27, 2023, officers received a license\n\nplate reader hit for a stolen vehicle and attempted to curb the vehicle. The vehicle did not stop until\n\nit subsequently crashed and became stuck between a wall and light pole. An officer exited his\n\nsquad car, walked in front of the crashed vehicle, and demanded that the occupants exit the vehicle.\n\nAccording to the State, defendant was in the driver\u2019s seat. The vehicle then accelerated in the\n\ndirection of the officer but did not hit him. The front driver\u2019s side tire blew out. Another squad car\n\napproached the vehicle on the left side and a city work truck moved in front of the vehicle, making\n\nit difficult for the vehicle to drive away. At this point, defendant got out of the crashed vehicle and\n\nattempted to run but was detained within a half block of the vehicle. Defendant reportedly made\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          In 2021, the General Assembly passed two separate acts that \u201cdismantled and rebuilt Illinois\u2019s\nstatutory framework for the pretrial release of criminal defendants.\u201d Rowe v. Raoul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9409445\"><a href=\"/opinion/9413969/rowe-v-raoul/\">2023 IL 129248</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b64\n(discussing Pub.

Jan. 1, 2023) (the Follow-Up Act).\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\npost-Miranda statements indicating that while he knew the vehicle was stolen, he did not try to hit\n\nthe police officer.\n\n\u00b65      In mitigation, the defense proffered that defendant was 19 years old and a lifelong resident\n\nof Chicago. His mother and pregnant fianc\u00e9e, with whom he already had one child, were present\n\nin court during the detention hearing to support him. Defendant had completed three years of high\n\nschool, received a food handling certificate, and worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant.\n\n\u00b66      The State conceded that defendant had no punishable background. His entire criminal\n\nhistory consists of a pending minor traffic matter for failing to obey a traffic signal, and a dismissed\n\ndomestic battery case that resulted in an order of protection against him. He missed one traffic\n\ncourt date but had no failures to appear or violations on the order of protection. As such, he scored\n\na two for new criminal activity and a one for failure to appear on the pretrial services assessment.\n\n\u00b67      Nevertheless, the State argued that defendant had a high likelihood of willful flight because\n\nof his multiple attempts, during the instant encounter, to avoid arrest. Defendant responded that it\n\nwas improper to conflate alleged flight from police officers with intention to thwart the judicial\n\nprocess to avoid prosecution because the police officers are not members of the judiciary, and\n\nfurther that there were conditions that could be imposed short of detention.\n\n\u00b68      The trial court agreed with the State that \u201cflight from law enforcement officers is flight\n\nfrom prosecution because officers trigger the prosecution process.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court\n\nfound that defendant had a high likelihood of flight to elude prosecution and ordered that the\n\ndefendant be detained and remanded to the custody of the Cook County Sheriff pending trial. The\n\ntrial court then read defendant his rights and then noted for the record that \u201cno least restrictive\n\ncondition, based on these allegations, can ensure defendant\u2019s return to court or mitigate the risk to\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\npublic safety.\u201d The trial court further indicated in the detention order that no condition or\n\ncombination of conditions could mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight because \u201cdefendant has shown\n\nan inability to comply with the commands of law enforcement officers, in disregard of his safety,\n\nand others. He has also demonstrated his refusal (unless forced) to comply and accede to the\n\njudicial system.\u201d The trial court also stated that defendant posed a real and present threat to the\n\nsafety of any person or persons or the community because \u201cdefendant refused to comply with law\n\nenforcement officers; he crashed into a building and pole trying to flee and drove at an officer. It\n\ntook a city truck and another car to stop him.\u201d\n\n\u00b69     Defendant\u2019s appeal was timely filed within 14 days, thereby conferring jurisdiction upon\n\nthis court. In considering this appeal, we have reviewed the following documents that were\n\nsubmitted pursuant to Rule 604(h): defendant\u2019s Notice of Pretrial Fairness Act Appeal, defendant\u2019s\n\nsupporting memorandum, and the State\u2019s response memorandum.\n\n\u00b6 10                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 11   On appeal, defendant does not contest that the State met its burden of proving by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the proof was evident and the presumption great that he committed a\n\nqualifying offense or that the charges are detainable under 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022).\n\nInstead, defendant challenges whether the State met its burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that he had a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution and that no condition\n\nor combination of conditions could mitigate that risk. Id. \u00a7 5/110-6.1(e)(3). Defendant contends\n\nthat the legislature dramatically changed the statutory framework for pretrial release and in so\n\ndoing intentionally deleted the \u201cflight from arrest\u201d language of section 110-5(a) (725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n5(a) (West 2022)), but left \u201cflight from prosecution\u201d in section 110-1(f) (725 ILCS 5/110-1(f)\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\n(West 2022)). He contends that the change evidenced the legislature\u2019s intent to remove \u2018flight\n\nfrom arrest\u2019 as a consideration when determining pretrial release. Additionally, defendant contends\n\nthat the trial court erred in determining that no condition or combination of conditions would\n\nreasonably ensure his appearance for later hearings or prevent defendant from being charged with\n\na subsequent felony or Class A misdemeanor; and in sua sponte considering whether defendant\n\nposed a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons or the community without a\n\nverified petition filed by the State on that basis.\n\n\u00b6 12    The State responds that defendant misstates the 2022 version of section 110-5(a) of the Act\n\nand instead refers to the 2021 version prior to its amendment. Additionally, the State contends\n\nthat the amendment to section 110-5(a) allows the trial court to consider the nature and seriousness\n\nof the risk of obstructing or attempting to obstruct the criminal justice process that would be posed\n\nby defendant\u2019s release, which would include his evasion of arrest. 725 ILCS 5/110-5(a)(5) (West\n\n2022). The State further contends that the Act does not list any factors to consider whether a\n\ndefendant has a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution, and the plain language of\n\nsection 110-5(a)(5) does not limit what facts the trial court can consider when making such a\n\ndetermination. Further, the State argues that it is irrelevant that a definition for willful flight was\n\nincluded in section 110-1(f) (725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West 2022)) because that term does not appear\n\nin section 110-5(a)(5). Based on the language contained in section 110-5(a)(5), the State contends\n\nthat the avoidance of arrest is included in the obstruction of or attempt to obstruct the criminal\n\njustice process because all cases subject to the Act are dependent upon arrest. Defendant\u2019s use of\n\nviolence and multiple attempts to avoid arrest, including twice trying to elude the police by car\n\nand once on foot, fully established that no conditions would mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\nwhere he did not place the safety of others above his own self-interest in avoiding arrest, hence\n\nproving that no conditions could mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight.\n\n\u00b6 13     However, the State agrees that the trial court erred in making a sua sponte finding that\n\ndefendant\u2019s continued detention was justified where he posed a real and present threat to the safety\n\nof any person or persons or the community because it did not file a verified petition setting forth\n\nthe grounds, including specific articulable facts, that defendant posed a real and present threat to\n\nthe safety of any person(s) or the community as required by 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(d)(1) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 14     Pretrial release is governed by Article 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963\n\n(Code) (725 ILCS 5/110-1 et seq (West 2022)). Under the Code, all persons charged with an\n\noffense are eligible for pretrial release before conviction. 725 ILCS 5/110-2(a) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 15     Pursuant to the Code, a defendant\u2019s pretrial release may be denied only in certain statutorily\n\nlimited situations. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022). Upon the State\u2019s filing of a verified petition\n\nrequesting denial of pretrial release, the State has the burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the proof is evident or the presumption great that the defendant has committed a\n\nqualifying offense, that the defendant\u2019s pretrial release poses a real and present threat to the safety\n\nof any person or the community or a flight risk, and that less restrictive conditions would not avoid\n\na real and present threat to the safety of any person or the community and or prevent the\n\ndefendant\u2019s willful flight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-2; 5/110-6.1(a)(1.5), (4), (8) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 16     At all pretrial hearings, the prosecution has the burden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that any condition of release is necessary. 725 ILCS 5/110-2(b) (West 2022). In any order\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\nfor detention, the court shall make a written finding summarizing the court\u2019s reasons for\n\nconcluding that the defendant should be denied pretrial release, including why less restrictive\n\nconditions would not avoid a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons or the\n\ncommunity, based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or prevent the defendant\u2019s willful\n\nflight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(h)(1) (West 2022). Section 110-1(f) defines willful\n\nflight as \u201cintentional conduct with a purpose to thwart the judicial process to avoid prosecution;\n\nisolated instances of nonappearance in court alone are not evidence of the risk of willful flight;\n\nand reoccurrence and patterns of intentional conduct to evade prosecution and affirmative steps to\n\ncommunicate or remedy any missed court date can be considered. 725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West\n\n2022).\n\n\u00b6 17     A circuit court\u2019s finding that the State presented clear and convincing evidence that\n\nmandatory conditions of release would fail to protect any person or the community, and/or that the\n\ndefendant had a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution, or that the defendant failed\n\nto comply with previous conditions of pretrial release thereby requiring a modification or\n\nrevocation of the previously issued conditions of pretrial release, will not be reversed unless those\n\nfindings are against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The trial court\n\nemphasized and reiterated both orally and in the written order that \u201cflight from law enforcement\n\nofficers [was] flight from prosecution because officers trigger the prosecution process;\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendant has shown an inability to comply with the commands of law enforcement officers;\u201d\n\nand \u201cDefendant refused to comply with law enforcement officers[-] he crashed into a building and\n\npole trying to flee and drove at an officer.\u201d This was despite defendant\u2019s pretrial assessment score\n\nof one for failure to appear and two for new criminal activity. And, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s\n\nminimal criminal history, family support, and employment.\n\n\u00b6 19    We must therefore determine whether the trial court properly considered evading police\n\nduring arrest as \u201cwillful flight to avoid prosecution\u201d as contemplated by the Act.\n\n\u00b6 20    This is an issue of statutory interpretation which we review de novo.

Section 110-\n\n1(f) defines willful flight. 725 ILCS 5/110-1(f) (West 2022). However, section 110-5(a)(5) allows\n\nthe trial court to consider the nature and seriousness of the risk of obstructing or attempting to\n\nobstruct the criminal justice process that would be posed by defendant\u2019s release. 725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n5(a)(5) (West 2022).\n\n\u00b6 22    We do not find the language of the Act to be ambiguous and find that the legislature\u2019s\n\nintent can be ascertained from the plain language of the Act. Looking at section 5/110-6.1(a)(8) of\n\nthe Act, we find that its plain language, coupled with the definition of willful flight as found in\n\nsection 110-1(f) clearly refers to a defendant\u2019s willful avoidance of prosecution in court by failing\n\nto appear at court hearings and similar behaviors. Under a plain reading of this section, a defendant\n\nevading arrest would not trigger \u201cwillful flight from prosecution\u201d of section 110-6.1(a)(8) because\n\narrest does not equal prosecution; the prosecution of the offense has not begun. However, we do\n\nfind that the trial court could consider evasion of arrest under section 110-5(a)(5) of the Act when\n\nconsidering pretrial release as that section specifically refers to obstruction or the attempted\n\nobstruction of the criminal justice system that would be posed by defendant\u2019s release. Arrest is\n\nclearly part of the criminal justice system. Thus, we find that the trial court\u2019s consideration of\n\ndefendant\u2019s evasion of arrest was proper under the Act.\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\n\u00b6 23   Next, defendant contends that the State failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can mitigate his willful flight\n\nunder section 110-6.1(e)(3) of the Act (725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(e)(3) (West 2022)). He points to the\n\nState\u2019s failure to specifically address any one condition or any combination of conditions and why\n\nthose conditions would be insufficient.\n\n\u00b6 24   The State responds that defendant\u2019s use of violence and multiple attempts to avoid arrest,\n\nincluding twice trying to elude the police by car and once on foot fully established that no\n\nconditions would mitigate defendant\u2019s willful flight where he did not place the safety of others\n\nabove his own self-interest in avoiding arrest.\n\n\u00b6 25   Section 110-6.1 of the Act (725 ILCS 5/110-6.1 (West 2022)) provides that all defendants\n\nshall be presumed eligible for pretrial release and the State has to prove by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that no condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-\n\n10 can mitigate the defendant\u2019s willful flight for offenses listed in paragraph (8) of subsection (a).\n\nThat paragraph includes forcible felonies such as those defendant is charged with. Contrary to the\n\nState\u2019s assertion, the record does not indicate that the trial court considered any less restrictive\n\nmeans to pretrial detention. The Act requires that in any order for detention, the court shall make\n\na written finding summarizing the court\u2019s reasons for concluding that the defendant should be\n\ndenied pretrial release, including why less restrictive conditions would not avoid a real and present\n\nthreat to the safety of any person or persons or the community, based on the specific articulable\n\nfacts of the case, or prevent the defendant\u2019s willful flight from prosecution. 725 ILCS 5/110-\n\n6.1(h)(1) (West 2022). There is no evidence in the record that the trial court considered any\n\nalternatives to defendant\u2019s detention in violation of the Act; thus, we conclude that its order\n\n\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-23-2129B\n\n\ndenying pretrial release was an abuse of discretion and remand for consideration of defendant\u2019s\n\ndetention alternatives. In doing so, we are not making any finding that defendant is entitled to or\n\nmust receive pretrial release; we are remanding based on our finding that the record contains no\n\nevidence that the trial court considered any detention alternatives as required by the statute prior\n\nto ordering defendant\u2019s confinement.\n\n\u00b6 26    We also find that the portion of the trial court\u2019s detention order that concluded that\n\ndefendant\u2019s pretrial release posed a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons,\n\nor the community was error. As both parties agree, the State did not file a verified petition setting\n\nforth the grounds, including specific articulable facts, that defendant posed a real and present threat\n\nto the safety of any person(s) or the community, thus such finding was error, and we reverse that\n\nportion of the trial court\u2019s findings.\n\n\u00b6 27                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 28    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County\n\nrequiring defendant\u2019s pretrial detention entered on September 28, 2023, and remand for\n\nconsideration of defendant\u2019s detention alternatives.

First, while acknowledging\n\n           the text of the mechanics\u2019 lien law has changed over time, it contends the\n           Legislature intended the law to continue covering the same types of claimants\n           mentioned in the older cases. But nothing in our opinion says any differently.\n           We, again, find only that K&S cannot obtain the relief it seeks by characterizing\n           itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. Second, K&S reads section 8024 to\n           define laborer to mean both (1) any person who, acting as an employee, performs\n           labor on a project, and (2) any person who bestows skill or other necessary\n           services on a project. We disagree. The statute\u2019s plain terms speak only of a\n           \u201cperson who, acting as an employee,\u201d does certain things; it does not reference\n           some persons who are, and others who are not, acting as an employee. Third,\n           citing Government Code section 68081, K&S claims it is entitled to a rehearing\n           because we interpreted the term \u201claborer\u201d differently than the parties had\n           briefed. But the cited provision applies only when the court renders a decision\n           based on an \u201cissue\u201d that was not proposed or briefed (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68081); and\n           here, we based on our decision on the very issue\u2014and indeed, the very statute\u2014\n           the parties raised. Lastly, K&S claims we should grant it relief under section\n           9100, subdivision (a)(1). That provision describes one of the categories of\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       persons who may assert a claim against a payment bond\u2014namely, \u201c[a] person\n       that provides work for a public works contract, if the work is authorized by a\n       direct contractor, subcontractor, architect, project manager, or other person\n       having charge of all or part of the public works contract.\u201d (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a)(1).)\n       But K&S never discussed this particular provision in its initial briefing, nor has\n       it shown that it satisfied the distinct procedural requirements for seeking relief\n       under this provision. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9300, 9560.) We thus reject this belatedly raised\n       and insufficiently supported claim. (People ex rel.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 8000-9566) 1 provides a measure\nof protection to those working on private and public works of improvement. Among\nother things, it requires certain contractors that are awarded a public works contract\ninvolving an expenditure over $25,000 to post a payment bond before work begins. It\nalso authorizes laborers and several others to assert a claim against the payment bond\nwhen they have not been paid in full.\n       In this appeal, we consider two questions about this law that arose after a\nsubcontractor for two state projects failed to fully pay a staffing company for its services.\nWe consider first whether the staffing company is a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law. We consider next whether the payment bonds issued for these\nprojects are subject to the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s requirements. The trial court concluded\nthat the staffing company was not a \u201claborer\u201d and that the payment bonds were subject to\nthe mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s requirements. Because we agree, we affirm.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       California\u2019s Department of Transportation (Caltrans) awarded VSS International,\nInc. (VSSI) two contracts for road maintenance work. Each contract involved an\nexpenditure over $25,000, and for each, VSSI obtained a payment bond from the Western\nSurety Company (Western).\n       Titan DVBE Inc. (Titan) was a subcontractor for both projects. For most years it\noperated, Titan employed its workers directly. But after learning its insurance carrier\nwould no longer offer workers\u2019 compensation insurance in California, Titan turned to\nK&S Staffing Solutions, Inc. (K&S) to fulfill its staffing needs. After entering into an\nagreement with K&S, Titan continued to supervise the same workers as it had before and\ncontinued to find new workers when needed. But now K&S paid the workers\u2019 wages,\n\n\n\n1 Undesignated statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fpayroll taxes, vacation pay, sick pay, and unemployment insurance. Over time, K&S\u2019s\ncharges for its services cut into Titan\u2019s profitability, leading eventually, according to\nTitan\u2019s owner, to Titan becoming too \u201cupside down . . . to save.\u201d In the end, Titan never\npaid K&S all amounts it was owed for the Caltrans projects.\n       K&S later sued VSSI and Western (together, respondents) to recover these\namounts. It asserted it was a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law and\nhad a right to recover against the payment bonds for the two projects. But the trial court\ndisagreed. It noted that the term \u201claborer\u201d is defined in the mechanics\u2019 lien law to mean\n\u201ca person who, acting as an employee, performs labor upon, or bestows skill or other\nnecessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (a).) It then concluded\nthat K&S was not a \u201claborer\u201d because it failed to show it was the employer of the\nlaborers here, noting among other things that K&S failed to show that it hired, trained, or\nsupervised the workers.\n       After the trial court entered judgment in respondents\u2019 favor, respondents moved\nfor attorney fees under a provision in the mechanics\u2019 lien law requiring trial courts to\naward attorney fees to the prevailing party in any \u201caction to enforce the liability on [a]\n[payment] bond.\u201d (\u00a7 9564, subd. (c).) K&S opposed the motion. It argued that\nrespondents could not receive attorney fees under this provision because the payment\nbonds here were not \u201cpayment bonds\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It\nreasoned as follows: (1) The mechanics\u2019 lien law defines \u201cpayment bond\u201d to mean \u201ca\nbond required by Section 9550\u201d (\u00a7 8030); (2) section 9550 generally requires a payment\nbond for public works contracts involving expenditures over $25,000, but it provides an\nexemption if the contract is with a state department or certain other state entities (\u00a7 9550,\nsubds. (a), (e)); (3) the contracts here were with a state department, Caltrans; and (4)\ntherefore, section 9550 did not require a payment bond for these contracts. The trial\ncourt rejected K&S\u2019s argument and awarded attorney fees to respondents.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       K&S timely appealed both the trial court\u2019s judgment and its later award of\nattorney fees.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                                           Laborer\n       K&S first challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not a \u201claborer\u201d within the\nmeaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It asserts that it was a \u201claborer\u201d because it took on\nthe legal responsibilities of an employer for those who worked for Titan. Respondents\ncounter that being the workers\u2019 employer was not enough; K&S also needed to furnish\nworkers for the project, but it never did so. Considering the statutory text, we conclude\nthat both parties misunderstand the meaning of the term \u201claborer.\u201d But we agree with\nrespondents\u2019 bottom line: K&S was not a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law.\n       In interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[o]ur fundamental task . . . is to determine the\nLegislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brennon B. v. Superior\nCourt (2022) 13 Cal.5th 662, 673.) \u201cBecause statutory language \u2018generally provide[s]\nthe most reliable indicator\u2019 of that intent,\u201d we consider first \u201cthe words themselves,\ngiving them their \u2018usual and ordinary meanings\u2019 and construing them in context.\u201d\n(People v. Castenada (2000) 23 Cal.4th 743, 747.) In general, absent an ambiguity in the\nstatutory text, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain\nmeaning of the language governs.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.; see also Brennon B., at p. 673\n[\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018courts must generally follow [a statute\u2019s] plain meaning unless a literal\ninterpretation would result in absurd consequences the Legislature did not intend\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d].)\n       Applying these well-established principles here, we start with the relevant\nstatutory language. Section 9100 describes certain persons who are entitled to assert a\nclaim against a payment bond. (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a); see also \u00a7 9554, subd. (b)(1).) One of\nthose persons is a \u201claborer.\u201d (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a)(2).) Section 8024 defines that term. It\n\n                                               4\n\fprovides that \u201c \u2018[l]aborer\u2019 means a person who, acting as an employee, performs labor\nupon, or bestows skill or other necessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024,\nsubd. (a); see \u00a7 8000.) 2\n       K&S was not a \u201claborer\u201d under this definition. K&S repeatedly equates a\n\u201claborer\u201d with an employer, arguing, for instance, that it \u201cwas readily entitled to payment\nfor the labor it provided\u201d because \u201cany \u2018laborer,\u2019 i.e., employer, is entitled to collect on\nthe payment bonds.\u201d But as section 8024\u2019s plain text provides, a laborer is not a person\nwho, acting as an employer, bestows labor on a work of improvement. It is instead \u201ca\nperson who, acting as an employee, performs labor upon, or bestows skill or other\nnecessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (a), italics added.) K&S\nis not a person who was \u201cacting as an employee\u201d in any capacity, nor does it even allege\nas much.\n       K&S nonetheless maintains that it was a \u201claborer\u201d based on old case law\ndiscussing prior versions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It first cites a case from over a\ncentury ago, Sweet v. Fresno Hotel Co. (1917) 174 Cal. 789. In its view, that case\nestablished that \u201can employer is entitled to collect on payment bonds for labor provided\nto a project.\u201d But the relevant statute there is not the relevant statute here. The statute in\n\n\n\n\n2 Section 8024 further provides that \u201c \u2018[l]aborer\u2019 includes a person or entity to which a\nportion of a laborer\u2019s compensation for a work of improvement, including, but not\nlimited to, employer payments described in Section 1773.1 of the Labor Code and\nimplementing regulations, is paid by agreement with that laborer or the collective\nbargaining agent of that laborer.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (b).) According to the sponsor of the\nbill initially adding this type of language, the bill was \u201cintended to reinstate the ability\n(eroded by case law as well as federal statute and changes in California law) of laborers\nand employee trust funds to use state mechanics\u2019 liens and creditor priorities to obtain\npayment of unpaid wages and fringe benefits.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor\nAnalyses, Unfinished Business Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 914 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as\namended Aug. 31, 1999, p. 4.) No party alleges that this language has any relevance\nhere.\n\n                                              5\n\fSweet concerned \u201c \u2018the labor done and materials furnished by all persons except the\ncontractor\u2019 \u201d and allowed these persons \u201c \u2018a lien for the value thereof\u2019 \u201d in certain\ncircumstances. (Id. at p. 792.) The court ultimately found an employer was entitled to\nthe benefit of this statute when it agreed \u201cto bestow labor [for the construction of a]\nbuilding, hiring the men himself and paying their wages.\u201d (Id. at pp. 796-797.) But the\ncourt never defined the term \u201claborer,\u201d and its decision offers no help in interpreting the\ncurrent statutory definition of \u201claborer\u201d\u2014a definition initially added over 50 years after\nSweet. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, p. 2754.)\n       Nor is another case K&S cites\u2014Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway\nContractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152\u2014helpful in understanding this definition.\nAlthough the term \u201claborer\u201d had been defined by the time of this case, the court never\nmentioned it. And although the court said that \u201can entity which takes upon itself the legal\nresponsibilities of an employer is entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien and related remedies if it\nfurnishes the labor of its employees to a work of improvement\u201d (id. at p. 162), it never\ncharacterized such an entity as a \u201claborer\u201d itself. It instead said this type of an entity\nwould be covered under the mechanics\u2019 lien law as then written, which covered, among\nothers, \u201c \u2018all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon or bestowing skill\nor other necessary services on, or furnishing materials or leasing equipment to be used or\nconsumed in or furnishing appliances, teams, or power contributing to a work of\nimprovement.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at pp. 158-159.) But the mechanics\u2019 lien law has not used this\nlanguage in over a decade. (See Stats. 2010, ch. 697, \u00a7 20 [adding \u00a7 9100].) And while\nan employer that bestows labor may have been considered a \u201cperson[] . . . bestowing skill\nor other necessary services\u201d under this prior law, it is not a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning\nof section 8024, subdivision (a) today.\n       In rejecting K&S\u2019s position, we emphasize that our decision is a narrow one and\nfocused on the arguments tendered. We address only whether K&S can, as it argues,\nobtain the relief it seeks by characterizing itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. And\n\n                                                6\n\ffocusing on the mechanics\u2019 lien law as written today, rather than the law as written\ndecades ago, we conclude that it cannot.\n                                              II\n                                       Payment Bond\n       K&S next challenges the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees under section 9564.\nThat statute requires trial courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in any\n\u201caction to enforce the liability on [a] [payment] bond.\u201d (\u00a7 9564, subd. (c).) K&S argues\nthis provision is inapplicable here because a payment bond for a state project is not a\n\u201cpayment bond\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. That is so, it reasons,\nbecause \u201cpayment bond\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca bond required by Section 9550\u201d (\u00a7 8030,\nsubd. (b)) and section 9550 does not itself require a payment bond for \u201cstate entit[y]\u201d\nprojects like the ones here (\u00a7 9550, subd. (e); Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subd. (d)).\nRespondents counter that K&S misinterprets section 9550 and, even if its interpretation\nwere correct, it should be estopped from arguing section 9564 is inapplicable because it\nearlier claimed the statute was applicable when it sought its own attorney fees. Although\nwe find the statutory definition of \u201cpayment bond\u201d inartful, we reject K&S\u2019s reading of\nthe law.\n       As covered above, our fundamental task in matters of statutory interpretation is to\ndetermine the Legislature\u2019s intent, and to do so, we start with the statutory language\nitself. When the language is clear, as it is with the term \u201claborer,\u201d this generally\ndescribes both the start and end of our analysis. But our analysis is more searching when\nthe statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation. In that\ncircumstance, we may also consider other interpretive aids, including the statute\u2019s\npurpose, legislative history, and public policy. (Brennon B. v. Superior Court, supra, 13\nCal.5th at p. 673.) And even when the statutory language permits only one interpretation,\nwe \u201cneed not follow the plain meaning of a statute when to do so would \u2018frustrate[] the\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmanifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or [lead] to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d (California\nSchool Employees Assn. v. Governing Board (1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 340.)\n       Starting with the statutory text here, section 8030 defines \u201cpayment bond\u201d to mean\n\u201ca bond required by Section 9550.\u201d (\u00a7 8030, subd. (b).) Section 9550, in turn, is one of\ntwo provisions relevant to this case that requires a payment bond for public works\ncontracts. The other is Public Contract Code section 7103. Section 9550 covers most\npublic entities and requires a payment bond for public works contracts involving\nexpenditures over $25,000. (\u00a7 9550, subd. (a); see also \u00a7 8036 [defining public entity].)\nBut it includes an exemption if the contract is with any of the state entities identified in\nPublic Contract Code section 7103 (\u00a7 9550, subd. (e))\u2014which is to say, it exempts from\nits coverage contracts with \u201cevery state office, department, division, bureau, board, or\ncommission\u201d (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subd. (d)). Public Contract Code section\n7103 itself covers these state entities and, similar to section 9550, requires a payment\nbond for public works contracts involving expenditures over $25,000. (Pub. Contract\nCode, \u00a7 7103, subds. (a), (d).) 3\n       Considering the text of these statutes alone, we acknowledge that K&S\u2019s position\nhas some persuasive force. A \u201cpayment bond,\u201d after all, is defined to mean a bond\nrequired under section 9550 (\u00a7 8030, subd. (b)), and section 9550 did not itself require a\nbond for the contracts here. Public Contract Code section 7103 instead imposed this\n\n\n\n\n3 The State Contract Act (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10100-10285.5) is another statute that\nrequires payment bonds for certain public works contracts. It requires the filing of both a\nperformance bond and a payment bond for certain state projects involving expenditures\nover, as of 2023, $388,000. (Id., \u00a7\u00a7 10101-10103.5 [describing some exceptions], 10105\n[defining \u201cproject\u201d to be a state work of improvement with a total cost over $250,000,\nsubject to adjustments from the Director of Finance], 10221 [requiring bond]; Dept. of\nFinance Budget Letters, Budget Letter 22-01 (Jan. 26, 2022) <https://dof.ca.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/352/budget/budget-letters/BL-22-01.pdf> [as of Jan. 2, 2024],\narchived at: <https://perma.cc/5TUY-66RT> [adjusting project amount to $388,000].)\n\n                                              8\n\frequirement, as these contracts were with a state entity, Caltrans, covered in this statute\nrather than section 9550. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subds. (a), (d); see \u00a7 9550, subd.\n(e).) It thus follows, the argument goes, that the payment bonds here are not \u201cpayment\nbonds\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, and so the attorney fee provision\nin section 9564 for actions to enforce the liability on a payment bond is inapplicable\u2014as\nare all or part of the 15 other statutes in the relevant portion of the mechanics\u2019 lien law\nthat reference or concern a payment bond. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9100, 9300-9306, 9414, 9452, 9550-\n9564.)\n         But considering the statutory scheme as a whole, the relevant legislative history,\nand the absurd consequences that would follow from K&S\u2019s reading, we conclude that\nthis is not the meaning the Legislature intended. We begin with the broader statutory\nscheme, along with some historical context. The requirements for a payment bond have\nlong been a key part of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, and these requirements have historically\napplied to state projects. In 1971, for instance, the mechanics\u2019 lien law covered contracts\nwith a \u201cpublic entity\u201d\u2014a term defined to include \u201cthe state\u201d (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2,\np. 2759)\u2014and for those contracts involving expenditures over a specified amount, it\nrequired a \u201cpayment bond\u201d\u2014a term defined in general terms to mean \u201ca bond . . . which\nis conditioned for the payment in full of the claims of all claimants and which also by its\nterms is made to inure to the benefit of all claimants\u201d (id., p. 2756; see also id., \u00a7\u00a7 6-7,\npp. 2777-2779 [describing payment bond requirements]; id., \u00a7 11, p. 2783 [listing\neffective date of 1971]). This definition for \u201cpayment bond\u201d remained largely unchanged\nfor the next 40 years. (See Stats. 1994, ch. 974, \u00a7 2, p. 5688 [slightly modifying\ndefinition].) And although the Legislature revised it in 2010 to its current form, the\nLegislature declared in the act enacting this change that the \u201cact [wa]s intended to be\nnonsubstantive in effect,\u201d except for certain specified statutes irrelevant here. (Stats.\n2010, ch. 697, \u00a7 107, p. 3905.)\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       Still today, the mechanics\u2019 lien law purports to apply to public works contracts\nwith state and other public entities. The law, indeed, explicitly declares that the portion\ncovering public works of improvement\u2014division 4, part 6, title 3 of the Civil Code (title\n3)\u2014applies to all \u201cwork[s] of improvement contracted for by a public entity\u201d (\u00a7 9000),\nwith \u201cpublic entity\u201d defined, as in 1971, to include \u201cthe state\u201d (\u00a7 8036). This title\nincludes 16 statutes referencing or concerning payment bonds, including statutes\ndescribing the form of the payment bond (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9552-9554), identifying those\nhaving rights to make a claim against the bond (\u00a7 9100), and describing the procedures\nfor making a claim against the bond (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9558-9560). And while section 9550 of\nthis title explicitly exempts \u201cstate entity\u201d projects from its requirements for a payment\nbond, no similar provision explicitly exempts these projects from all the mechanics\u2019 lien\nlaw\u2019s requirements for payment bonds.\n       Considering the statutory scheme as a whole, together with this historical context,\nwe find the Legislature had no intent to exempt state projects from all these requirements\ncovering payment bonds. Exempting these projects, to start, would be inconsistent with\nthe Legislature\u2019s general intent to have title 3 apply to all works of improvement\ncontracted for by a \u201cpublic entity\u201d (\u00a7 9000)\u2014a term, again, defined to include \u201cthe state\u201d\n(\u00a7 8036). It would also be a major departure from the historical application of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s payment bond provisions to state projects, even though the\nLegislature provided no mention of an intent to undertake this change when it amended\nthe term \u201cpayment bond\u201d in 2010. Had the Legislature in fact intended to make this\nchange\u2014a change that would alter the fundamental details of the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2014\nwe would have expected a clearer indication of this intent. (See Mendoza v. Fonseca\nMcElroy Grinding Co., Inc. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 1118, 1135 [doubting that the Legislature\nintended a major change in the law when it made a \u201csubtle\u201d change]; Jones v. Lodge at\nTorrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1171 [finding similarly].) But rather\nthan evince this intent, the Legislature declared that the act amending \u201cpayment bond\u201d to\n\n                                             10\n\fits current form was \u201cintended to be nonsubstantive in effect,\u201d except, again, for certain\nspecified statutes irrelevant here. (Stats. 2010, ch. 697, \u00a7 107, p. 3905.)\n       The legislative history for the bill adding the current definition of \u201cpayment\nbond,\u201d moreover, confirms that the bill was not intended to effect the change that K&S\nenvisions. The Legislature added this definition following a recommendation from the\nCalifornia Law Revision Commission (the Commission). (See Recommendation:\nMechanics\u2019 Lien Law (Feb. 2008) 37 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. 527 (2007).)\nAlthough the Commission proposed amending the definition of \u201cpayment bond\u201d to the\ngeneral form it takes today (id., pp. 736, 777), it emphasized that it \u201cd[id] not propose\nradical changes to the operation of the existing construction law remedies,\u201d let alone one\nthat would exclude state projects from all the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s payment bond\nprovisions (id., p. 530). The Commission also, after discussing the various provisions\ncovering payment bonds for state projects, explained that its proposal \u201cpreserves the\nstatus quo . . . in a more understandable fashion.\u201d (Id., p. 602, fn. omitted.) Consistent\nwith the Commission\u2019s characterization of its proposed revisions, legislative committee\nanalyses afterward described these revisions\u2014including those to the payment bond\u2014as\n\u201cmodest.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 189 (2009-2010 Reg.\nSess.) as amended June 2, 2010, p. 6; Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Analysis of Sen.\nBill No. 189 (2009-2010 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 2, 2010, pp. 1-2.) All this\ndemonstrates that the \u201cpayment bond\u201d revisions were meant to leave the prior scheme for\npayment bonds largely intact, not to effect a radical change entirely exempting state\nprojects from the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s provisions on payment bonds.\n       Consideration of absurd consequences also cuts against K&S\u2019s position. Under\nK&S\u2019s interpretation, payment bonds for state projects would not be covered under the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law at all; they would instead, K&S asserts, be covered under Public\nContract Code section 7103. But Public Contract Code section 7103 does not identify\nwho can make a claim against the payment bond, nor does it describe the procedures for\n\n                                             11\n\fmaking a claim against the bond. The mechanics\u2019 lien law instead provides these details,\nas it has since Public Contract Code section 7103 was initially enacted in 1985. (See\nStats. 1985, ch. 678, \u00a7 2, p. 2273.) And so while Public Contract Code section 7103\nrequires a payment bond for certain state projects, the evident purpose of this requirement\nwould be defeated without the provisions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. The mere act of\nobtaining a payment bond, after all, serves little purpose if unpaid parties have no right to\nassert a claim against the bond. Accepting K&S\u2019s position, then, would render payment\nbonds for state projects covered under Public Contract Code section 7103 largely\nmeaningless\u2014an absurd result that the Legislature plainly never intended.\n       The legislative history for Public Contract Code section 7103 further demonstrates\nthat it was never intended to be, as K&S would have it, a stand-alone provision on\npayment bonds. Before the statute\u2019s enactment, both state entities and other public\nentities were covered under the same provision in the mechanics\u2019 lien law that required a\npayment bond for contracts involving expenditures over a certain amount. (Stats. 1980,\nch. 293, \u00a7 1, p. 619.) But in 1985, the Legislature distinguished between the two. Under\nthe 1985 amendment, for most public entities, the requirement for a payment bond would\nbe triggered when the contract involved an expenditure over $25,000. (Stats. 1985, ch.\n678, \u00a7 1, p. 2273.) But for the state entities described in the then-newly added Public\nContract Code section 7103, the requirement would instead be triggered when the\ncontract involved an expenditure over $5,000. (Stats. 1985, ch. 678, \u00a7 2, p. 2273.) As\nthis amendment suggests and as the legislative history confirms, this bill was not intended\nto exempt these state entities from the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s general requirements\ncovering payment bonds. It instead served to lower the expenditure amount required to\ntrigger the bond requirement for state projects and thereby provide added protections to\nthose working on these projects. (See Assem. Consumer Protection Com., Analysis of\nAssem. Bill No. 2406 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Mar. 8, 1985, p. 2 [noting\nthat the bill author proposed the amendment because \u201csubcontractors and materials\n\n                                             12\n\fsuppliers sometimes fail to receive payment from their general contractor on state\nprojects of $25,000 or less\u201d].) 4\n       Taking all these considerations together, we conclude that title 3\u2019s general\npayment bond requirements\u2014including the attorney fee provision in section 9564\u2014\napply both to state projects that require a bond under Public Contract Code section 7103\nand other \u201cpublic entity\u201d projects that require a bond under section 9550. Our conclusion\nin this respect is consistent with a prominent practice guide on the mechanics\u2019 lien law,\nCalifornia Mechanics\u2019 Liens and Related Construction Remedies (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed.\n2022). That guide explains that payment bonds for public works contracts are required\nby section 9550, Public Contract Code section 7103, and the State Contract Act, and,\nwithout distinguishing between these payment bonds, states that \u201c[p]ayment bonds for\npublic works are governed by [Civil Code] \u00a7\u00a7 9550-9566.\u201d (Cal. Mechanics\u2019 Liens and\nRelated Construction Remedies (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2022) \u00a7 10.18.) We need not\naddress whether this holds true for payment bonds required under the State Contract Act,\na topic not covered in the parties\u2019 briefing. But we agree title 3\u2019s general requirements\nfor payment bonds apply for bonds required under both section 9550 and Public Contract\nCode section 7103. In reaching this conclusion, we again acknowledge that our reading\nstrays from the plain language of section 8030\u2019s definition of \u201cpayment bond.\u201d But for\nthe reasons covered, we find this to be one of those rare cases where it is necessary to\ndepart from a statute\u2019s plain language. (See California School Employees Assn. v.\nGoverning Board, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 335-336, 346 [construing a statute establishing\n\n\n\n\n4 The Legislature has since raised this expenditure amount to $25,000.

It is hereby ordered that\nthe petition for rehearing is denied.\n\n\n       It is also ordered that the opinion filed herein on January 2, 2024, be modified as\nfollows:\n\n\n1. On page 7, at the end of the last paragraph of part I of the Discussion, add as\n    footnote 3 the following footnote, which will require renumbering of all subsequent\n    footnotes:\n       3 In a petition for rehearing, K&amp;S raises four points. First, while acknowledging\n\n           the text of the mechanics\u2019 lien law has changed over time, it contends the\n           Legislature intended the law to continue covering the same types of claimants\n           mentioned in the older cases. But nothing in our opinion says any differently.\n           We, again, find only that K&amp;S cannot obtain the relief it seeks by characterizing\n           itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. Second, K&amp;S reads section 8024 to\n           define laborer to mean both (1) any person who, acting as an employee, performs\n           labor on a project, and (2) any person who bestows skill or other necessary\n           services on a project. We disagree. The statute\u2019s plain terms speak only of a\n           \u201cperson who, acting as an employee,\u201d does certain things; it does not reference\n           some persons who are, and others who are not, acting as an employee. Third,\n           citing Government Code section 68081, K&amp;S claims it is entitled to a rehearing\n           because we interpreted the term \u201claborer\u201d differently than the parties had\n           briefed. But the cited provision applies only when the court renders a decision\n           based on an \u201cissue\u201d that was not proposed or briefed (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68081); and\n           here, we based on our decision on the very issue\u2014and indeed, the very statute\u2014\n           the parties raised. Lastly, K&amp;S claims we should grant it relief under section\n           9100, subdivision (a)(1). That provision describes one of the categories of\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       persons who may assert a claim against a payment bond\u2014namely, \u201c[a] person\n       that provides work for a public works contract, if the work is authorized by a\n       direct contractor, subcontractor, architect, project manager, or other person\n       having charge of all or part of the public works contract.\u201d (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a)(1).)\n       But K&amp;S never discussed this particular provision in its initial briefing, nor has\n       it shown that it satisfied the distinct procedural requirements for seeking relief\n       under this provision. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9300, 9560.) We thus reject this belatedly raised\n       and insufficiently supported claim. (People ex rel.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 8000-9566) 1 provides a measure\nof protection to those working on private and public works of improvement. Among\nother things, it requires certain contractors that are awarded a public works contract\ninvolving an expenditure over $25,000 to post a payment bond before work begins. It\nalso authorizes laborers and several others to assert a claim against the payment bond\nwhen they have not been paid in full.\n       In this appeal, we consider two questions about this law that arose after a\nsubcontractor for two state projects failed to fully pay a staffing company for its services.\nWe consider first whether the staffing company is a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law. We consider next whether the payment bonds issued for these\nprojects are subject to the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s requirements. The trial court concluded\nthat the staffing company was not a \u201claborer\u201d and that the payment bonds were subject to\nthe mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s requirements. Because we agree, we affirm.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       California\u2019s Department of Transportation (Caltrans) awarded VSS International,\nInc. (VSSI) two contracts for road maintenance work. Each contract involved an\nexpenditure over $25,000, and for each, VSSI obtained a payment bond from the Western\nSurety Company (Western).\n       Titan DVBE Inc. (Titan) was a subcontractor for both projects. For most years it\noperated, Titan employed its workers directly. But after learning its insurance carrier\nwould no longer offer workers\u2019 compensation insurance in California, Titan turned to\nK&amp;S Staffing Solutions, Inc. (K&amp;S) to fulfill its staffing needs. After entering into an\nagreement with K&amp;S, Titan continued to supervise the same workers as it had before and\ncontinued to find new workers when needed. But now K&amp;S paid the workers\u2019 wages,\n\n\n\n1 Undesignated statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fpayroll taxes, vacation pay, sick pay, and unemployment insurance. Over time, K&amp;S\u2019s\ncharges for its services cut into Titan\u2019s profitability, leading eventually, according to\nTitan\u2019s owner, to Titan becoming too \u201cupside down . . . to save.\u201d In the end, Titan never\npaid K&amp;S all amounts it was owed for the Caltrans projects.\n       K&amp;S later sued VSSI and Western (together, respondents) to recover these\namounts. It asserted it was a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law and\nhad a right to recover against the payment bonds for the two projects. But the trial court\ndisagreed. It noted that the term \u201claborer\u201d is defined in the mechanics\u2019 lien law to mean\n\u201ca person who, acting as an employee, performs labor upon, or bestows skill or other\nnecessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (a).) It then concluded\nthat K&amp;S was not a \u201claborer\u201d because it failed to show it was the employer of the\nlaborers here, noting among other things that K&amp;S failed to show that it hired, trained, or\nsupervised the workers.\n       After the trial court entered judgment in respondents\u2019 favor, respondents moved\nfor attorney fees under a provision in the mechanics\u2019 lien law requiring trial courts to\naward attorney fees to the prevailing party in any \u201caction to enforce the liability on [a]\n[payment] bond.\u201d (\u00a7 9564, subd. (c).) K&amp;S opposed the motion. It argued that\nrespondents could not receive attorney fees under this provision because the payment\nbonds here were not \u201cpayment bonds\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It\nreasoned as follows: (1) The mechanics\u2019 lien law defines \u201cpayment bond\u201d to mean \u201ca\nbond required by Section 9550\u201d (\u00a7 8030); (2) section 9550 generally requires a payment\nbond for public works contracts involving expenditures over $25,000, but it provides an\nexemption if the contract is with a state department or certain other state entities (\u00a7 9550,\nsubds. (a), (e)); (3) the contracts here were with a state department, Caltrans; and (4)\ntherefore, section 9550 did not require a payment bond for these contracts. The trial\ncourt rejected K&amp;S\u2019s argument and awarded attorney fees to respondents.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       K&amp;S timely appealed both the trial court\u2019s judgment and its later award of\nattorney fees.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                                           Laborer\n       K&amp;S first challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not a \u201claborer\u201d within the\nmeaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It asserts that it was a \u201claborer\u201d because it took on\nthe legal responsibilities of an employer for those who worked for Titan. Respondents\ncounter that being the workers\u2019 employer was not enough; K&amp;S also needed to furnish\nworkers for the project, but it never did so. Considering the statutory text, we conclude\nthat both parties misunderstand the meaning of the term \u201claborer.\u201d But we agree with\nrespondents\u2019 bottom line: K&amp;S was not a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law.\n       In interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[o]ur fundamental task . . . is to determine the\nLegislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brennon B. v.

In general, absent an ambiguity in the\nstatutory text, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain\nmeaning of the language governs.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.; see also Brennon B., at p. 673\n[\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018courts must generally follow [a statute\u2019s] plain meaning unless a literal\ninterpretation would result in absurd consequences the Legislature did not intend\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d].)\n       Applying these well-established principles here, we start with the relevant\nstatutory language. Section 9100 describes certain persons who are entitled to assert a\nclaim against a payment bond. (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a); see also \u00a7 9554, subd. (b)(1).) One of\nthose persons is a \u201claborer.\u201d (\u00a7 9100, subd. (a)(2).) Section 8024 defines that term. It\n\n                                               4\n\fprovides that \u201c \u2018[l]aborer\u2019 means a person who, acting as an employee, performs labor\nupon, or bestows skill or other necessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024,\nsubd. (a); see \u00a7 8000.) 2\n       K&amp;S was not a \u201claborer\u201d under this definition. K&amp;S repeatedly equates a\n\u201claborer\u201d with an employer, arguing, for instance, that it \u201cwas readily entitled to payment\nfor the labor it provided\u201d because \u201cany \u2018laborer,\u2019 i.e., employer, is entitled to collect on\nthe payment bonds.\u201d But as section 8024\u2019s plain text provides, a laborer is not a person\nwho, acting as an employer, bestows labor on a work of improvement. It is instead \u201ca\nperson who, acting as an employee, performs labor upon, or bestows skill or other\nnecessary services on, a work of improvement.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (a), italics added.) K&amp;S\nis not a person who was \u201cacting as an employee\u201d in any capacity, nor does it even allege\nas much.\n       K&amp;S nonetheless maintains that it was a \u201claborer\u201d based on old case law\ndiscussing prior versions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. It first cites a case from over a\ncentury ago, Sweet v. Fresno Hotel Co. (1917) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">174 Cal. 789</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In its view, that case\nestablished that \u201can employer is entitled to collect on payment bonds for labor provided\nto a project.\u201d But the relevant statute there is not the relevant statute here. The statute in\n\n\n\n\n2 Section 8024 further provides that \u201c \u2018[l]aborer\u2019 includes a person or entity to which a\nportion of a laborer\u2019s compensation for a work of improvement, including, but not\nlimited to, employer payments described in Section 1773.1 of the Labor Code and\nimplementing regulations, is paid by agreement with that laborer or the collective\nbargaining agent of that laborer.\u201d (\u00a7 8024, subd. (b).) According to the sponsor of the\nbill initially adding this type of language, the bill was \u201cintended to reinstate the ability\n(eroded by case law as well as federal statute and changes in California law) of laborers\nand employee trust funds to use state mechanics\u2019 liens and creditor priorities to obtain\npayment of unpaid wages and fringe benefits.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor\nAnalyses, Unfinished Business Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 914 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as\namended Aug. 31, 1999, p. 4.) No party alleges that this language has any relevance\nhere.\n\n                                              5\n\fSweet concerned \u201c \u2018the labor done and materials furnished by all persons except the\ncontractor\u2019 \u201d and allowed these persons \u201c \u2018a lien for the value thereof\u2019 \u201d in certain\ncircumstances.

But the\ncourt never defined the term \u201claborer,\u201d and its decision offers no help in interpreting the\ncurrent statutory definition of \u201claborer\u201d\u2014a definition initially added over 50 years after\nSweet. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, p. 2754.)\n       Nor is another case K&amp;S cites\u2014Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway\nContractors, Inc.

And although the court said that \u201can entity which takes upon itself the legal\nresponsibilities of an employer is entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien and related remedies if it\nfurnishes the labor of its employees to a work of improvement\u201d (id. at p. 162), it never\ncharacterized such an entity as a \u201claborer\u201d itself. It instead said this type of an entity\nwould be covered under the mechanics\u2019 lien law as then written, which covered, among\nothers, \u201c \u2018all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon or bestowing skill\nor other necessary services on, or furnishing materials or leasing equipment to be used or\nconsumed in or furnishing appliances, teams, or power contributing to a work of\nimprovement.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at pp. 158-159.) But the mechanics\u2019 lien law has not used this\nlanguage in over a decade. (See Stats. 2010, ch. 697, \u00a7 20 [adding \u00a7 9100].) And while\nan employer that bestows labor may have been considered a \u201cperson[] . . . bestowing skill\nor other necessary services\u201d under this prior law, it is not a \u201claborer\u201d within the meaning\nof section 8024, subdivision (a) today.\n       In rejecting K&amp;S\u2019s position, we emphasize that our decision is a narrow one and\nfocused on the arguments tendered. We address only whether K&amp;S can, as it argues,\nobtain the relief it seeks by characterizing itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. And\n\n                                                6\n\ffocusing on the mechanics\u2019 lien law as written today, rather than the law as written\ndecades ago, we conclude that it cannot.\n                                              II\n                                       Payment Bond\n       K&amp;S next challenges the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees under section 9564.\nThat statute requires trial courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in any\n\u201caction to enforce the liability on [a] [payment] bond.\u201d (\u00a7 9564, subd. (c).) K&amp;S argues\nthis provision is inapplicable here because a payment bond for a state project is not a\n\u201cpayment bond\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. That is so, it reasons,\nbecause \u201cpayment bond\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca bond required by Section 9550\u201d (\u00a7 8030,\nsubd. (b)) and section 9550 does not itself require a payment bond for \u201cstate entit[y]\u201d\nprojects like the ones here (\u00a7 9550, subd. (e); Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subd. (d)).\nRespondents counter that K&amp;S misinterprets section 9550 and, even if its interpretation\nwere correct, it should be estopped from arguing section 9564 is inapplicable because it\nearlier claimed the statute was applicable when it sought its own attorney fees. Although\nwe find the statutory definition of \u201cpayment bond\u201d inartful, we reject K&amp;S\u2019s reading of\nthe law.\n       As covered above, our fundamental task in matters of statutory interpretation is to\ndetermine the Legislature\u2019s intent, and to do so, we start with the statutory language\nitself. When the language is clear, as it is with the term \u201claborer,\u201d this generally\ndescribes both the start and end of our analysis. But our analysis is more searching when\nthe statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation. In that\ncircumstance, we may also consider other interpretive aids, including the statute\u2019s\npurpose, legislative history, and public policy. (Brennon B. v. Superior Court, supra, 13\nCal.5th at p. 673.) And even when the statutory language permits only one interpretation,\nwe \u201cneed not follow the plain meaning of a statute when to do so would \u2018frustrate[] the\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmanifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or [lead] to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d (California\nSchool Employees Assn. v. Governing Board (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 Cal.4th 333</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340.)\n       Starting with the statutory text here, section 8030 defines \u201cpayment bond\u201d to mean\n\u201ca bond required by Section 9550.\u201d (\u00a7 8030, subd. (b).) Section 9550, in turn, is one of\ntwo provisions relevant to this case that requires a payment bond for public works\ncontracts. The other is Public Contract Code section 7103. Section 9550 covers most\npublic entities and requires a payment bond for public works contracts involving\nexpenditures over $25,000. (\u00a7 9550, subd. (a); see also \u00a7 8036 [defining public entity].)\nBut it includes an exemption if the contract is with any of the state entities identified in\nPublic Contract Code section 7103 (\u00a7 9550, subd. (e))\u2014which is to say, it exempts from\nits coverage contracts with \u201cevery state office, department, division, bureau, board, or\ncommission\u201d (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subd. (d)). Public Contract Code section\n7103 itself covers these state entities and, similar to section 9550, requires a payment\nbond for public works contracts involving expenditures over $25,000. (Pub. Contract\nCode, \u00a7 7103, subds. (a), (d).) 3\n       Considering the text of these statutes alone, we acknowledge that K&amp;S\u2019s position\nhas some persuasive force. A \u201cpayment bond,\u201d after all, is defined to mean a bond\nrequired under section 9550 (\u00a7 8030, subd. (b)), and section 9550 did not itself require a\nbond for the contracts here. Public Contract Code section 7103 instead imposed this\n\n\n\n\n3 The State Contract Act (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10100-10285.5) is another statute that\nrequires payment bonds for certain public works contracts. It requires the filing of both a\nperformance bond and a payment bond for certain state projects involving expenditures\nover, as of 2023, $388,000. (Id., \u00a7\u00a7 10101-10103.5 [describing some exceptions], 10105\n[defining \u201cproject\u201d to be a state work of improvement with a total cost over $250,000,\nsubject to adjustments from the Director of Finance], 10221 [requiring bond]; Dept. of\nFinance Budget Letters, Budget Letter 22-01 (Jan. 26, 2022) &lt;https://dof.ca.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/352/budget/budget-letters/BL-22-01.pdf&gt; [as of Jan. 2, 2024],\narchived at: &lt;https://perma.cc/5TUY-66RT&gt; [adjusting project amount to $388,000].)\n\n                                              8\n\frequirement, as these contracts were with a state entity, Caltrans, covered in this statute\nrather than section 9550. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 7103, subds. (a), (d); see \u00a7 9550, subd.\n(e).) It thus follows, the argument goes, that the payment bonds here are not \u201cpayment\nbonds\u201d within the meaning of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, and so the attorney fee provision\nin section 9564 for actions to enforce the liability on a payment bond is inapplicable\u2014as\nare all or part of the 15 other statutes in the relevant portion of the mechanics\u2019 lien law\nthat reference or concern a payment bond. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9100, 9300-9306, 9414, 9452, 9550-\n9564.)\n         But considering the statutory scheme as a whole, the relevant legislative history,\nand the absurd consequences that would follow from K&amp;S\u2019s reading, we conclude that\nthis is not the meaning the Legislature intended. We begin with the broader statutory\nscheme, along with some historical context. The requirements for a payment bond have\nlong been a key part of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, and these requirements have historically\napplied to state projects. In 1971, for instance, the mechanics\u2019 lien law covered contracts\nwith a \u201cpublic entity\u201d\u2014a term defined to include \u201cthe state\u201d (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2,\np. 2759)\u2014and for those contracts involving expenditures over a specified amount, it\nrequired a \u201cpayment bond\u201d\u2014a term defined in general terms to mean \u201ca bond . . . which\nis conditioned for the payment in full of the claims of all claimants and which also by its\nterms is made to inure to the benefit of all claimants\u201d (id., p. 2756; see also id., \u00a7\u00a7 6-7,\npp. 2777-2779 [describing payment bond requirements]; id., \u00a7 11, p. 2783 [listing\neffective date of 1971]). This definition for \u201cpayment bond\u201d remained largely unchanged\nfor the next 40 years. (See Stats. 1994, ch. 974, \u00a7 2, p. 5688 [slightly modifying\ndefinition].) And although the Legislature revised it in 2010 to its current form, the\nLegislature declared in the act enacting this change that the \u201cact [wa]s intended to be\nnonsubstantive in effect,\u201d except for certain specified statutes irrelevant here. (Stats.\n2010, ch. 697, \u00a7 107, p. 3905.)\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       Still today, the mechanics\u2019 lien law purports to apply to public works contracts\nwith state and other public entities. The law, indeed, explicitly declares that the portion\ncovering public works of improvement\u2014division 4, part 6, title 3 of the Civil Code (title\n3)\u2014applies to all \u201cwork[s] of improvement contracted for by a public entity\u201d (\u00a7 9000),\nwith \u201cpublic entity\u201d defined, as in 1971, to include \u201cthe state\u201d (\u00a7 8036). This title\nincludes 16 statutes referencing or concerning payment bonds, including statutes\ndescribing the form of the payment bond (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9552-9554), identifying those\nhaving rights to make a claim against the bond (\u00a7 9100), and describing the procedures\nfor making a claim against the bond (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9558-9560). And while section 9550 of\nthis title explicitly exempts \u201cstate entity\u201d projects from its requirements for a payment\nbond, no similar provision explicitly exempts these projects from all the mechanics\u2019 lien\nlaw\u2019s requirements for payment bonds.\n       Considering the statutory scheme as a whole, together with this historical context,\nwe find the Legislature had no intent to exempt state projects from all these requirements\ncovering payment bonds. Exempting these projects, to start, would be inconsistent with\nthe Legislature\u2019s general intent to have title 3 apply to all works of improvement\ncontracted for by a \u201cpublic entity\u201d (\u00a7 9000)\u2014a term, again, defined to include \u201cthe state\u201d\n(\u00a7 8036). It would also be a major departure from the historical application of the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s payment bond provisions to state projects, even though the\nLegislature provided no mention of an intent to undertake this change when it amended\nthe term \u201cpayment bond\u201d in 2010. Had the Legislature in fact intended to make this\nchange\u2014a change that would alter the fundamental details of the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2014\nwe would have expected a clearer indication of this intent.

The Legislature added this definition following a recommendation from the\nCalifornia Law Revision Commission (the Commission). (See Recommendation:\nMechanics\u2019 Lien Law (Feb. 2008) 37 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. 527 (2007).)\nAlthough the Commission proposed amending the definition of \u201cpayment bond\u201d to the\ngeneral form it takes today (id., pp. 736, 777), it emphasized that it \u201cd[id] not propose\nradical changes to the operation of the existing construction law remedies,\u201d let alone one\nthat would exclude state projects from all the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s payment bond\nprovisions (id., p. 530).

Consistent\nwith the Commission\u2019s characterization of its proposed revisions, legislative committee\nanalyses afterward described these revisions\u2014including those to the payment bond\u2014as\n\u201cmodest.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 189 (2009-2010 Reg.\nSess.) as amended June 2, 2010, p. 6; Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Analysis of Sen.\nBill No. 189 (2009-2010 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 2, 2010, pp. 1-2.) All this\ndemonstrates that the \u201cpayment bond\u201d revisions were meant to leave the prior scheme for\npayment bonds largely intact, not to effect a radical change entirely exempting state\nprojects from the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s provisions on payment bonds.\n       Consideration of absurd consequences also cuts against K&amp;S\u2019s position. Under\nK&amp;S\u2019s interpretation, payment bonds for state projects would not be covered under the\nmechanics\u2019 lien law at all; they would instead, K&amp;S asserts, be covered under Public\nContract Code section 7103. But Public Contract Code section 7103 does not identify\nwho can make a claim against the payment bond, nor does it describe the procedures for\n\n                                             11\n\fmaking a claim against the bond. The mechanics\u2019 lien law instead provides these details,\nas it has since Public Contract Code section 7103 was initially enacted in 1985. (See\nStats. 1985, ch. 678, \u00a7 2, p. 2273.) And so while Public Contract Code section 7103\nrequires a payment bond for certain state projects, the evident purpose of this requirement\nwould be defeated without the provisions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. The mere act of\nobtaining a payment bond, after all, serves little purpose if unpaid parties have no right to\nassert a claim against the bond. Accepting K&amp;S\u2019s position, then, would render payment\nbonds for state projects covered under Public Contract Code section 7103 largely\nmeaningless\u2014an absurd result that the Legislature plainly never intended.\n       The legislative history for Public Contract Code section 7103 further demonstrates\nthat it was never intended to be, as K&amp;S would have it, a stand-alone provision on\npayment bonds. Before the statute\u2019s enactment, both state entities and other public\nentities were covered under the same provision in the mechanics\u2019 lien law that required a\npayment bond for contracts involving expenditures over a certain amount. (Stats. 1980,\nch. 293, \u00a7 1, p. 619.) But in 1985, the Legislature distinguished between the two. Under\nthe 1985 amendment, for most public entities, the requirement for a payment bond would\nbe triggered when the contract involved an expenditure over $25,000. (Stats. 1985, ch.\n678, \u00a7 1, p. 2273.) But for the state entities described in the then-newly added Public\nContract Code section 7103, the requirement would instead be triggered when the\ncontract involved an expenditure over $5,000. (Stats. 1985, ch. 678, \u00a7 2, p. 2273.) As\nthis amendment suggests and as the legislative history confirms, this bill was not intended\nto exempt these state entities from the mechanics\u2019 lien law\u2019s general requirements\ncovering payment bonds. It instead served to lower the expenditure amount required to\ntrigger the bond requirement for state projects and thereby provide added protections to\nthose working on these projects. (See Assem. Consumer Protection Com., Analysis of\nAssem. Bill No. 2406 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Mar. 8, 1985, p. 2 [noting\nthat the bill author proposed the amendment because \u201csubcontractors and materials\n\n                                             12\n\fsuppliers sometimes fail to receive payment from their general contractor on state\nprojects of $25,000 or less\u201d].) 4\n       Taking all these considerations together, we conclude that title 3\u2019s general\npayment bond requirements\u2014including the attorney fee provision in section 9564\u2014\napply both to state projects that require a bond under Public Contract Code section 7103\nand other \u201cpublic entity\u201d projects that require a bond under section 9550. Our conclusion\nin this respect is consistent with a prominent practice guide on the mechanics\u2019 lien law,\nCalifornia Mechanics\u2019 Liens and Related Construction Remedies (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed.\n2022). That guide explains that payment bonds for public works contracts are required\nby section 9550, Public Contract Code section 7103, and the State Contract Act, and,\nwithout distinguishing between these payment bonds, states that \u201c[p]ayment bonds for\npublic works are governed by [Civil Code] \u00a7\u00a7 9550-9566.\u201d (Cal. Mechanics\u2019 Liens and\nRelated Construction Remedies (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2022) \u00a7 10.18.) We need not\naddress whether this holds true for payment bonds required under the State Contract Act,\na topic not covered in the parties\u2019 briefing. But we agree title 3\u2019s general requirements\nfor payment bonds apply for bonds required under both section 9550 and Public Contract\nCode section 7103. In reaching this conclusion, we again acknowledge that our reading\nstrays from the plain language of section 8030\u2019s definition of \u201cpayment bond.\u201d But for\nthe reasons covered, we find this to be one of those rare cases where it is necessary to\ndepart from a statute\u2019s plain language. (See California School Employees Assn. v.\nGoverning Board, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 335-336, 346 [construing a statute establishing\n\n\n\n\n4 The Legislature has since raised this expenditure amount to $25,000.

The form did not ask him to specify whether\n\nhe was suing defendants in their individual or official capacities, and McGuire did not otherwise\n\fNo. 22-6049, McGuire v. Loudon County, et al.\n\n\nindicate the capacity in which he was suing the officers. A few days later, McGuire filed a \u201cFollow\n\nup letter\u201d consisting of four handwritten pages. The letter repeated the allegations against the\n\ncorrection officers contained in the initial complaint and also set forth new allegations of excessive\n\nforce perpetrated by a new officer, Captain Keener, several days after McGuire sent his initial\n\ncomplaint. McGuire attached a copy of his initial complaint to the letter. Again, he did not indicate\n\nwhether he wished to sue defendants in their official or individual capacities.\n\n       In July 2022, McGuire filed another prisoner complaint form\u2014this one a little different\n\nthan his last. He listed Loudon County, not Loudon County Jail, as a defendant and added Keener\n\nas a defendant based on the second incident detailed by McGuire in his \u201c[f]ollow up letter.\u201d Unlike\n\nthe first form, this complaint form contained check boxes under each defendant\u2019s name where the\n\nplaintiff could check \u201cIndividual capacity\u201d or \u201cOfficial capacity.\u201d McGuire checked the individual\n\ncapacity box for Keener and the official capacity boxes for Blackwell, Ward, and Myers. He\n\nattached four handwritten pages that were titled, \u201cShort Summary and Complaint\u201d and \u201cShort\n\nSummary.\u201d In those pages, he said that he was \u201cwriting a quick summary of what happened in\n\ncase [the court] need[ed] to know ag[a]in\u201d and indicated that he wished \u201cto keep things moving\n\nalong\u201d with his lawsuit. R. 5, July 2022 Filing, PageID 51.\n\n       In October 2022, McGuire filed yet another prisoner complaint form. This time McGuire\n\nnamed Loudon County Jail (not Loudon County) as a defendant; he also named Keener, Ward,\n\nand Brockwell and checked the official capacity boxes for these defendants. Myers was not named\n\nin this form. McGuire attached a one-page handwritten document to his filing, titled \u201cShort\n\nSummary,\u201d briefly reiterating the same allegations against defendants. In it, he noted again that\n\nhe \u201cwish[ed] to che[]ck [the] progress on [his] case.\u201d R. 6, October 2022 Filing, PageID 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 22-6049, McGuire v. Loudon County, et al.\n\n\n       A week later, the district court screened his complaint under the Prison Litigation Reform\n\nAct (PLRA). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). The court construed McGuire\u2019s October 2022 filing\u2014\n\nthe pleading containing the least information\u2014as a motion to amend his complaint, granted the\n\nmotion, and considered only the allegations set forth in that filing. The court then determined that\n\nMcGuire had failed to state a claim and dismissed the case. It explained that Loudon County Jail\n\nis not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to liability under \u00a7 1983 and that, even if the court were to construe the\n\ncomplaint as suing Loudon County, the claim would still fail because McGuire did not allege that\n\na Loudon County custom or policy caused a violation of his constitutional rights. And because\n\nthe court determined\u2014based on McGuire\u2019s marking of the \u201cOfficial capacity\u201d boxes\u2014that\n\nMcGuire had sued Keener, Ward, and Brockwell in their official capacities, those claims were\n\nequivalent to claims against Loudon County and failed for the same reason.\n\n       McGuire appeals. He is now represented by counsel. Because the court below dismissed\n\nthe case at the PLRA screening stage, the defendants have not been served. Consequently, no\n\nresponse brief has been filed.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       McGuire does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Loudon\n\nCounty Jail (or Loudon County) or its dismissal of the official capacity claims against the jailers.\n\nAnd we do not disturb the district court\u2019s judgment as to those claims. Instead, McGuire argues\n\nthat the court erred in sua sponte construing his October 2022 filing as a motion to amend his\n\ncomplaint and in concluding that this filing superseded his prior pleadings. He contends the court\n\nshould have found that his October 2022 filing supplemented, not superseded, his previous filings,\n\nor that the court should have read his October 2022 filing to incorporate his earlier filings by\n\nreference. Had the court done this, McGuire says, it would have determined that he intended to\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 22-6049, McGuire v. Loudon County, et al.\n\n\nsue the jailers in their individual capacities and that he stated a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. We\n\nreview decisions granting or denying leave to amend for an abuse of discretion, Kreipke v. Wayne\n\nState Univ., 807 F.3d 768, 781 (6th Cir. 2015), but we review the district court\u2019s decision to\n\nrecharacterize a party\u2019s pleading de novo, see Kalamazoo River Study Grp. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp.,\n\n355 F.3d 574, 583\u201384 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n       The district court erred by treating McGuire\u2019s October 2022 filing as a motion for leave to\n\nfile a new complaint that superseded all prior filings. \u201cThe pleadings of pro se petitioners are held\n\nto less stringent standards than those prepared by attorneys . . . .\u201d Martin v. Overton, 391 F.3d\n\n710, 712 (6th Cir. 2004). There is no indication in the October 2022 filing that McGuire intended\n\nto undo all the work he had already done. See Tolliver v. Noble, 752 F. App\u2019x 254, 266 (6th Cir.\n\n2018) (\u201c[W]hen . . . pleadings are filed by pro se plaintiffs, the court may consider additional,\n\nsupporting documents which either serve to elaborate on a complaint or amend the initial filing.\u201d).\n\nRather than describe the allegations in detail, as he had done previously, McGuire\u2019s October 2022\n\nfiling merely attached a \u201cShort Summary\u201d outlining them. R. 6, October 2022 Filing, PageID 65.\n\nThe allegations, though summarized, were the same allegations offered in support of his claims in\n\nthe prior filing. McGuire did not ask for leave to amend a prior filing. He also said that he\n\n\u201cwish[ed] to check [the] progress o[f] [his] case,\u201d suggesting that he was not trying to start over\n\nwith a new complaint but instead wished to move his case (and the prior filings) along. Id. Finally,\n\nnothing in the October 2022 filing contradicts his prior filing, either in the facts or the law. Though\n\nMcGuire previously indicated that he was bringing individual capacity claims against the jailers\n\n(or said nothing at all), nothing precluded him from also pursuing official capacity claims. Cf.\n\nMitchell v. Chapman, 343 F.3d 811, 823 (6th Cir. 2003). In sum, we are not persuaded that\n\nMcGuire intended his October 2022 filing to supersede his prior filings. See Kiir v. N. Dakota\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 22-6049, McGuire v. Loudon County, et al.\n\n\nPub. Health, 651 F.

READLER, Circuit Judge. Following the denial of tenure in Oakland\n\nUniversity\u2019s school of nursing, Dr. Lan Yao sued the university, asserting claims of race and\n\nnational origin discrimination, as well as retaliation for filing a workplace complaint. These\n\ntheories fail. Yao has not identified a similarly situated employee who received more favorable\n\ntreatment than she, dooming her discrimination claims. Nor can she demonstrate a causal\n\nconnection between her protected activity and the university\u2019s allegedly retaliatory action, a fact\n\nfatal to her retaliation claim. Accordingly, we affirm the award of summary judgment in the\n\nuniversity\u2019s favor.\n\n                                                I.\n\n       Like most departments in institutions of higher learning, Oakland University\u2019s nursing\n\nschool employs a process for granting tenure to faculty members. Professors at the university\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\ninitially serve in term-limited positions without job security, after which they are eligible for\n\ntenure. A tenure applicant assembles a dossier documenting her qualifications. The application\n\nis then measured by three criteria: scholarship, teaching, and professional service. Of these,\n\nscholarship, especially \u201cpublications that have been critically evaluated,\u201d is the most important\n\nfactor. Published work measures the candidate\u2019s contribution to knowledge in a scholarly field.\n\nTwo committees review the application. First is the Nursing Committee, followed by the Faculty\n\nCommittee. The latter committee makes a tenure recommendation to the university based on a\n\nreview of the candidate\u2019s qualifications. At the final stage, the university\u2019s board of trustees, after\n\nreceiving input from the provost and president, issues a final tenure determination. Those who\n\nunsuccessfully apply for tenure are not re-employed full time.\n\n       Now consider Yao\u2019s journey through this process. Hailing from China, Yao was hired as\n\nan assistant professor in the nursing school. Following a few years of service by Yao, the board\n\nof trustees approved her reappointment to a final two-year term as an assistant professor, after\n\nwhich she would be eligible for tenure. Although the Nursing Committee supported Yao\u2019s\n\nreappointment, it noted that she had produced no work for publication and \u201chighly recommend[ed]\n\nthat Dr. Yao submit and have published several empirically-based manuscripts in peer-reviewed\n\njournals\u201d before her next review. Yet at the time of Yao\u2019s tenure review, she had co-authored only\n\none peer-reviewed article since her reappointment. Both the Nursing Committee and the Faculty\n\nCommittee determined that Yao did not meet the school\u2019s criteria for scholarship and research. In\n\nturn, each committee voted to deny Yao tenure, a decision later ratified by the board. Yao\n\nrequested a second review. Her efforts, however, again proved unsuccessful\u2014she was denied\n\ntenure a second time.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\n       After the university notified Yao that her employment would terminate at the end of her\n\ncontract, Yao filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC), alleging both race and national origin discrimination and retaliatory conduct in violation\n\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She later filed this suit. Ultimately, the district court\n\nawarded summary judgment in the university\u2019s favor. To the district court\u2019s eye, Yao failed to\n\nshow that she was treated worse than similarly situated non-protected tenure candidates, defeating\n\nher discrimination theories. Likewise, the court held, Yao could not establish a causal connection\n\nbetween her first EEOC complaint and her eventual firing, undermining her retaliation claim.\n\nYao\u2019s timely appeal followed.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. Dixon v. Gonzales,\n\n481 F.3d 324, 330 (6th Cir. 2007). In undertaking that fresh review, we consider the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to Yao, the nonmoving party. Id. Eyeing the evidence that way, summary\n\njudgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute of material fact in the record, and if the\n\nuniversity should prevail as a matter of law. See Lemon v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 958 F.3d 417, 418\u2013\n\n19 (6th Cir. 2020); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n       A. Yao first contends that issues of material fact remain concerning whether she was\n\nimpermissibly denied tenure on account of her race and national origin. Title VII declares it\n\nunlawful \u201cfor an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s\n\nrace . . . or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). A Title VII plaintiff may show such\n\ndiscrimination with either direct or indirect evidence. Redlin v. Grosse Pointe Pub. Sch. Sys., 921\n\nF.3d 599, 606 (6th Cir. 2019). As Yao relies on the latter, we apply the McDonnell Douglas burden\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\nshifting framework to evaluate her claim. Lindsay v. Yates, 498 F.3d 434, 440 n.7 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\nUnder that construct, Yao bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).\n\n       Our focus here is on whether Yao was \u201ctreated differently than similarly situated non-\n\nprotected employees,\u201d one element of a prima facie case. Redlin, 921 F.3d at 607 (citation\n\nomitted); see also Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., 266 F.3d 401, 406 (6th Cir. 2001) (articulating\n\na four-part test). To show as much, Yao need not demonstrate an exact correlation between herself\n\nand the allegedly similarly situated employees outside of her protected class. But, at the very least,\n\nthere must be relevant similarity between them. Blount v. Stanley Eng\u2019g Fastening, 55 F.4th 504,\n\n511\u201312 (6th Cir. 2022). Yao fails to make this showing.\n\n       Yao identifies six white comparators who, she says, were similarly situated to her and yet\n\nwere granted tenure. According to Yao, this disparity is demonstrated through peer-reviewed\n\npublication totals. Recall that Yao had co-authored only one peer-reviewed article during her time\n\nat the university. Yet her comparators uniformly had published relatively more journal articles.\n\nTrue, the qualifying journal articles of Dr. Julie Kruse, one of Yao\u2019s comparators, had seemingly\n\nnot yet appeared in print at the time the university reviewed her for tenure. That said, Kruse had\n\none co-authored article accepted for publication at the time and another described as a \u201crevise and\n\nresubmit\u201d that had been accepted and was available on a journal website. To the Faculty\n\nCommittee, this was enough to show that Kruse had sufficiently contributed to knowledge in her\n\nfield. Yao compares less favorably. At the time the Faculty Committee re-reviewed Yao\u2019s tenure\n\napplication, Yao still had published only one journal article. And while she disclosed one\n\nadditional manuscript as under review and another as under development, the committee could\n\n\u201cnot find any evidence of drafts\u201d of these documents. Kruse also had four peer-reviewed\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\npresentations to Yao\u2019s one. So we agree with the district court that Yao was not similarly situated\n\nto her comparators.\n\n       Yao believes that her scholarship was \u201csuperior\u201d to that of her comparators. Whether that\n\nis true is not easy for us to say. After all, as judges, we are ill-equipped to stand in as a \u201csuper-\n\ntenure\u201d committee to assess the quality of Yao\u2019s research. Thrash v. Miami Univ., 549 F. App\u2019x\n\n511, 521 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Villanueva v. Wellesley Coll., 930 F.2d 124, 129 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\nAnd, even then, it bears reminding that publication count is first among equals in terms of the\n\nfactors the school considers when assessing scholarship. As Yao\u2019s comparators fared better in this\n\nrespect, she fails to establish a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination.\n\n       B. Yao also asserted a Title VII retaliation claim. As part of her prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, Yao was required to demonstrate a causal connection between her protected activity\n\n(the filing of a complaint with the EEOC) and an adverse action she suffered (her termination).\n\nRandolph v. Ohio Dep\u2019t of Youth Servs., 453 F.3d 724, 736 (6th Cir. 2006). The timeline of events,\n\nhowever, suggests otherwise. Over a month before she filed her EEOC complaint, the university\n\nnotified Yao that her employment would be terminated at the end of her contract. As \u201c[c]ausation\n\nmoves forward, not backwards,\u201d Yao fails to show a causal connection between her EEOC filing\n\nand her eventual firing. See Pearson v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 723 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2013)\n\n(Souter, J.) (\u201c[N]o protected conduct after an adverse employment action can serve as the predicate\n\nfor a retaliation claim.\u201d); see also Mickey v. Zeidler Tool & Die Co., 516 F.3d 516, 529 (6th Cir.\n\n2008) (Batchelder, J., concurring) (same). We thus affirm the grant of summary judgment to the\n\nuniversity on Yao\u2019s retaliation claim.\n\n       C. Lastly, Yao asks that we remand the case for further discovery due to the fact that she\n\nwas proceeding largely on a pro se basis in district court. But Yao failed to make this argument\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\nbefore the district court, not even in her motion for reconsideration. We typically hold that an\n\nargument is forfeited \u201cwhen [a] party belatedly asserts it on appeal after having failed to raise it in\n\nthe district court.\u201d Bannister v. Knox Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 49 F.4th 1000, 1011 (6th Cir. 2022).\n\nThat is the case even for pro se litigants, see Peoples v. Hoover, 377 F. App\u2019x 461, 463 (6th Cir.\n\n2010) (collecting cases), absent an extraordinarily compelling circumstance, Bannister, 49 F.4th\n\nat 1012.

Title VII declares it\n\nunlawful \u201cfor an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s\n\nrace . . . or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).

Express Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">266 F.3d 401</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (6th Cir. 2001) (articulating\n\na four-part test). To show as much, Yao need not demonstrate an exact correlation between herself\n\nand the allegedly similarly situated employees outside of her protected class. But, at the very least,\n\nthere must be relevant similarity between them. Blount v. Stanley Eng\u2019g Fastening, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">55 F.4th 504</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n511\u201312 (6th Cir. 2022). Yao fails to make this showing.\n\n       Yao identifies six white comparators who, she says, were similarly situated to her and yet\n\nwere granted tenure. According to Yao, this disparity is demonstrated through peer-reviewed\n\npublication totals. Recall that Yao had co-authored only one peer-reviewed article during her time\n\nat the university. Yet her comparators uniformly had published relatively more journal articles.\n\nTrue, the qualifying journal articles of Dr. Julie Kruse, one of Yao\u2019s comparators, had seemingly\n\nnot yet appeared in print at the time the university reviewed her for tenure. That said, Kruse had\n\none co-authored article accepted for publication at the time and another described as a \u201crevise and\n\nresubmit\u201d that had been accepted and was available on a journal website. To the Faculty\n\nCommittee, this was enough to show that Kruse had sufficiently contributed to knowledge in her\n\nfield. Yao compares less favorably. At the time the Faculty Committee re-reviewed Yao\u2019s tenure\n\napplication, Yao still had published only one journal article. And while she disclosed one\n\nadditional manuscript as under review and another as under development, the committee could\n\n\u201cnot find any evidence of drafts\u201d of these documents. Kruse also had four peer-reviewed\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fCase No. 22-1980, Yao v. Oakland Univ.\n\n\npresentations to Yao\u2019s one. So we agree with the district court that Yao was not similarly situated\n\nto her comparators.\n\n       Yao believes that her scholarship was \u201csuperior\u201d to that of her comparators. Whether that\n\nis true is not easy for us to say. After all, as judges, we are ill-equipped to stand in as a \u201csuper-\n\ntenure\u201d committee to assess the quality of Yao\u2019s research.

As Yao\u2019s comparators fared better in this\n\nrespect, she fails to establish a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination.\n\n       B. Yao also asserted a Title VII retaliation claim. As part of her prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, Yao was required to demonstrate a causal connection between her protected activity\n\n(the filing of a complaint with the EEOC) and an adverse action she suffered (her termination).\n\nRandolph v. Ohio Dep\u2019t of Youth Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">453 F.3d 724</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (6th Cir. 2006). The timeline of events,\n\nhowever, suggests otherwise. Over a month before she filed her EEOC complaint, the university\n\nnotified Yao that her employment would be terminated at the end of her contract. As \u201c[c]ausation\n\nmoves forward, not backwards,\u201d Yao fails to show a causal connection between her EEOC filing\n\nand her eventual firing. See Pearson v. Mass. Bay Transp.

Eugene Anderson appeals his fifty-one-month\n\nsentence for counterfeiting United States currency. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n         In March 2021, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Anderson with\n\nconspiracy to make and pass counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 1); making counterfeit U.S. currency\n\n(Count 2); and passing counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 3).          According to the indictment,\n\nAnderson used several printers, a scanner and a paper cutter to alter legitimate federal reserve notes\n\nso that the bills displayed higher face values. Anderson and his co-defendants then passed the\n\ncounterfeit bills at numerous businesses in Southwest Michigan, obtaining \u201cgenuine United States\n\ncurrency and other things of value\u201d in exchange. DE 1, Indictment, Page ID 2. In an interview\n\nfollowing his arrest, Anderson admitted that he had been counterfeiting currency for about two\n\nyears.\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n       At his arraignment, Anderson pled not guilty, and the magistrate judge released him on a\n\n$20,000 appearance bond. As a condition of pretrial release, the magistrate ordered that Anderson\n\nreside at a community correction facility and submit to drug testing and treatment. Roughly two\n\nmonths after his placement at the assigned facility, Anderson submitted a positive drug test. And\n\nthe following day, he absconded. A warrant for Anderson\u2019s arrest then issued, but Anderson\n\nremained missing for the next fourteen months. Finally, in August 2022, police re-apprehended\n\nAnderson while responding to a report of customers attempting to use counterfeit bills at a\n\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurant.     Shortly after his arrest, Anderson pled guilty to the three-count\n\nindictment.\n\n       In advance of sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report.\n\nTwo elements of that report provide the backdrop to Anderson\u2019s appeal.             First, based on\n\nAnderson\u2019s flight from pretrial supervision, Anderson\u2019s offense level computation (a) included a\n\ntwo-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and (b) did not include a\n\ntwo-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Second, based on a\n\nterm of probation connected with a 2015 check forgery conviction, Anderson\u2019s criminal history\n\nscore included a two-point enhancement \u2014 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) \u2014 for committing\n\nthe instant offenses \u201cwhile under a criminal justice sentence.\u201d DE 130, Presentence Report, Page\n\nID 669.\n\n       At sentencing, Anderson objected only to the probation officer\u2019s failure to credit him for\n\nacceptance of responsibility. After hearing argument from both parties, the district court overruled\n\nthe objection. Accepting the probation officer\u2019s calculation of a total offense level of 15 and a\n\ncriminal history category of VI, the court then sentenced Anderson to a top-of-the-range sentence\n\nof 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal timely followed.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n                                                II.\n\n       Anderson challenges the district court\u2019s sentence on two grounds, which we discuss in turn.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Anderson first argues that the district court erred in denying him credit for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility because he pled guilty, participated in the presentence interview, and expressed\n\nremorse for his crimes. Before addressing the merits of this argument, we note that the applicable\n\nstandard of review in this context remains unsettled. See United States v. Thomas, 933 F.3d 605,\n\n611\u201312 (6th Cir. 2019) (compiling conflicting cases); see also United States v. Guerrero, 76 F.4th\n\n519, 531 (6th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[T]he standard of review for [appeals from the denial of a reduction\n\nunder \u00a7 3E1.1] is not entirely clear.\u201d); United States v. Cadieux, 846 F. App\u2019x 389, 392 (6th Cir.\n\n2021) (noting the absence of \u201cclear consensus . . . about what standard of review applies in appeals\n\nchallenging the application of [\u00a7 3E1.1]\u201d). Nevertheless, because Anderson\u2019s objection fails even\n\nunder de novo review, we, like several panels before us, defer resolution of this open question to\n\na later date. See, e.g., Cadieux, 846 F. App\u2019x at 392 (\u201cBecause Cadieux\u2019s arguments fail even\n\nunder de novo review (the most favorable standard to him), we \u2018leave resolution of the standard\n\nof review for another day.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Thomas, 933 F.3d at 610). Thus, we turn to the merits.\n\n       The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the\n\ndefendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense[.]\u201d           U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 3E1.1(a). And when a defendant pleads guilty and admits the conduct comprising the offense\n\nof conviction, he provides \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1\n\ncmt. n.3. But this does not mean that a defendant who pleads guilty is \u201centitled to an [acceptance\n\nof responsibility] adjustment . . . as a matter of right.\u201d Id. Instead, the Guidelines commentary\n\nprovides district courts with a variety of relevant factors to weigh, including the voluntariness of\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nthe defendant\u2019s withdrawal from criminal conduct, the timeliness of his acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, and the consistency \u2014 or inconsistency \u2014 of his conduct with his professed\n\nacceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. nn. 1(b), 1(h) and 3. And of particular\n\nrelevance here, conduct which justifies application of a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal\n\nconduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4. For \u201c[o]nly in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 case may a defendant\n\nreceive both an offense-level increase for obstruction and an offense-level decrease for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.\u201d Thomas, 933 F.3d at 612 (quoting \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4).\n\n       Anderson contends that his conduct represents one such extraordinary case. Specifically,\n\nAnderson highlights that after his re-arrest, he \u201c[pled] guilty to all charges,\u201d \u201cwas totally\n\nforthcoming in terms of his involvement in the offense conduct,\u201d and \u201cexpressed sincere remorse.\u201d\n\nCA6 R. 14, Appellant Br., at 10. Anderson also draws a parallel between his conduct and that of\n\nthe defendant in United States v. Gregory, 315 F.3d 637 (6th Cir. 2003), who this court held was\n\nentitled to credit for acceptance of responsibility, despite his attempt to shield his co-defendant\n\nfrom prosecution by instructing her not to cooperate with law enforcement. Id. at 640\u201341. Like\n\nGregory, Anderson argues that he too \u201cabandoned his attempt to obstruct justice and made a great\n\neffort to accept responsibility,\u201d entitling him to a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1(a). CA6 R.\n\n14, Appellant Br., at 12.\n\n       We find Anderson\u2019s contentions meritless, for several reasons. First, neither the timeliness\n\nnor voluntariness of Anderson\u2019s acceptance of responsibility supports application of the \u00a7 3E1.1(a)\n\nreduction. After his failed drug test and flight from pretrial supervision, Anderson remained a\n\nfugitive from justice for over fourteen months. On any one of the 428 days he spent at large,\n\nAnderson could have turned himself in and willingly accepted responsibility for his actions. But\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nAnderson did not do so, choosing to instead force law enforcement to catch him. And even at that\n\njuncture, when police had found him and his re-apprehension was all but guaranteed, Anderson\n\ncontinued to skirt responsibility by providing arresting officers with a false name and date of birth.\n\nMoreover, at the time of his arrest, Anderson was again in possession of counterfeit currency.\n\nThese actions are patently inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, and they reflect an\n\nunavoidable truth: Anderson did not voluntarily own up to his actions; he merely ran out of\n\noptions. See United States v. Starks, 64 F. App\u2019x 501, 502 (6th Cir. 2003) (denying credit for\n\nacceptance of responsibility where defendant absconded from pretrial detention for nine months.)\n\n       On top of this, Anderson fails to demonstrate that any of his post-arrest conduct renders his\n\ncase \u201cextraordinary.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4. \u201cTo qualify as an extraordinary circumstance, a\n\ndefendant must do something more than merely plead guilty following his obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nStarks, 64 F. App\u2019x at 502; see also United States v. Harper, 246 F.3d 520, 528 (6th Cir. 2001)\n\n(\u201c[I]t is the ordinary case in which a defendant pleads guilty after his attempts to obstruct justice\n\nare thwarted.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Leachman, 309 F.3d 377 (6th Cir.\n\n2002). Here, the only evidence of \u201cextraordinary\u201d conduct that Anderson musters is his guilty\n\nplea, his participation in the presentence investigation process, and his expressions of remorse.\n\nThese acts, though praiseworthy, constitute an entirely ordinary course of conduct for those faced\n\nwith a criminal indictment. Had Anderson quickly turned himself in after his escape, his\n\nimmediate change of heart might have provided grounds for deeming his actions \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nSee Harper, 246 F.3d at 528 (\u201cFor example, if a defendant awaiting trial escapes from custody but\n\nthen immediately turns himself into authorities, this could constitute an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 case in\n\nwhich a defendant accepts responsibility subsequent to an attempt to obstruct justice.\u201d). But\n\nAnderson chose a different path. His guilty plea and expressions of remorse demonstrate little\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nmore than resignation to the failure of his attempted obstruction, and they fall well short of\n\nextraordinary. Id.\n\n       Finally, Anderson\u2019s reliance on our decision in Gregory is misplaced. There, Kenneth\n\nGregory, a prisoner at Federal Correctional Institute, Memphis, enlisted his sister\u2019s help smuggling\n\ndrugs into prison. Gregory, 315 F.3d at 639. Prison officials quickly foiled the scheme, and when\n\ninterviewed by federal investigators, Gregory admitted his culpability and agreed to cooperate in\n\ntheir investigation. Id. Hoping to keep his accomplice out of trouble, however, Gregory later sent\n\nhis sister a letter advising her not to cooperate with law enforcement and suggesting innocent\n\nexplanations that she could use to defend her conduct. Id. But on the very same day that he sent\n\nthe letter, Gregory reversed course. Id. During an interview with federal investigators, Gregory\n\ncalled his sister, encouraged her to cooperate in the investigation, and put her on the phone with\n\nthe federal agent who was interviewing him. Id.\n\n       Despite his attempted obstruction, for which Gregory received a two-level enhancement\n\nunder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a panel of this court found that Gregory was entitled to credit for\n\nacceptance of responsibility as well. Gregory, 315 F.3d at 640\u201341. The court analogized\n\nGregory\u2019s actions to those of the defendant in United States v. Williams, 176 F.3d 301 (6th Cir.\n\n1999), who received a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1 after he \u201crecanted his trial testimony\n\nand moved to withdraw his plea agreement, subjecting the court to a hearing on the issue, before\n\nrestating his original position and accepting responsibility.\u201d Id. at 641 (quoting Williams, 176 F.3d\n\nat 311). And the court observed that not only had Gregory \u201cnever denied his own responsibility\n\nand guilt,\u201d but further that \u201c[a]ll of [Gregory\u2019s] obstructive conduct [had] predated his indictment.\u201d\n\nId.   Given these \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances, the court remanded Gregory\u2019s case for\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nresentencing with instructions to downwardly adjust his offense level for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility. Id. at 644.\n\n        The circumstances surrounding Anderson\u2019s ultimate admission of guilt contrast markedly\n\nwith the facts this court confronted in Gregory. Notwithstanding his inculpatory statements to\n\npolice during his first arrest, Anderson initially denied his own responsibility and guilt by pleading\n\nnot guilty. And unlike Gregory, most of Anderson\u2019s obstructive conduct postdated his indictment.\n\nFurthermore, Anderson\u2019s obstructive conduct lasted well over a year, while Gregory managed to\n\nnullify his attempted obstruction within a matter of hours. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,\n\nGregory voluntarily reversed his attempted obstruction, while Anderson surrendered to law\n\nenforcement only when left with no other option. Anderson no doubt had the opportunity to\n\ndemonstrate the same extraordinary conduct that Gregory exhibited, but he chose not to.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility\n\nunder \u00a7 3E1.1.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        Anderson next objects to the calculation of his criminal history score, challenging the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that his offense conduct overlapped with his probationary period for a\n\nprior conviction. Because Anderson failed to raise this objection before the district court, we\n\nreview his criminal history scoring for plain error. United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 385\n\n(6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). To meet this burden, Anderson must show that the district court\u2019s\n\ncalculation constituted (1) an error, (2) that is obvious and clear, (3) that affected his substantial\n\nrights, and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Prater, 766 F.3d 501, 518 (6th Cir. 2014). We find that Anderson fails to make\n\nsuch a showing.\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n       The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district courts to add two points to a defendant\u2019s\n\ncriminal history score \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal\n\njustice sentence, including probation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d).1 The parties agree that Anderson\n\ncompleted the term of probation connected with his 2015 check forgery conviction in June 2019.\n\nThey disagree, however, as to when Anderson\u2019s offense conduct in the instant case began. Citing\n\nthe indictment and the government\u2019s factual recitation at his change-of-plea hearing, Anderson\n\ncontends that he pled guilty to \u201cconduct occurring between September 28, 2019, and January 20,\n\n2020,\u201d thus ruling out any overlap with his term of probation. CA6 R. 14, Appellant Br., at 14.\n\nThe government, on the other hand, contends that Anderson\u2019s offense conduct includes all\n\n\u201crelevant conduct\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, which would capture both (1) the 2018 and\n\n2019 counterfeiting that Anderson admitted to when initially arrested and (2) Anderson\u2019s\n\nproduction and use of a counterfeit bill at a CVS in March 2019. We find that the government\u2019s\n\nposition represents the correct application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n       The application notes to \u00a7 4A1.1(d) state that the provision\u2019s two-point increase applies \u201cif\n\nthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under\n\nany criminal justice sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) cmt. n.4 (emphasis added).2 In this case, the\n\n\n1\n  Note that the district court sentenced Anderson under the 2021 version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines, so we reference and cite to the 2021 version in this opinion. The provision discussed\nherein, \u00a7 4A1.1(d) in the 2021 version, is now codified in the 2023 Sentencing Guidelines at\n\u00a7 4A1.1(e).\n2\n  The government raises (and dismisses) the possibility that application note 4 impermissibly\nexpands \u00a7 4A1.1(d)\u2019s scope, as would run contrary to Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019). But\nAnderson makes no such argument. See Georgia-Pac. Consumer Prods. LP v. NCR Corp.,\n40 F.4th 481, 483 (6th Cir. 2022) (\u201cGenerally, an argument not raised in an appellate brief or at\noral argument is forfeited[.]\u201d). And even he did, his burden under plain error review would be to\npoint to \u201cbinding case law that answers the question\u201d in his favor. Bullard v. United States,\n937 F.3d 654, 663 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting United States v. Al-Maliki, 787 F.3d 784, 795 (6th Cir.\n2015)). Of course, he has not done this either. Accordingly, we leave discussion of the propriety\n                                               -8-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nthree counts to which Anderson pled guilty were grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2),\n\ntherefore, Anderson\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes \u201call acts and omissions [that he] committed,\n\naided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused,\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A),\n\nand which involved \u201cthe same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of\n\nconviction.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Anderson\u2019s counterfeiting activities prior to June 2019 constituted\n\n\u201cthe same course of conduct\u201d as his late 2019 and early 2020 counterfeiting if the two were\n\n\u201csufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they [were] part\n\nof a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d         \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(ii).\n\nAlternatively, Anderson\u2019s prior counterfeiting made up a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d with his later\n\ncounterfeiting if the two were \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor,\n\nsuch as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(i).\n\n       Applying the foregoing Guideline provisions and interpretive comments, we conclude that\n\nAnderson committed part of the instant offense while on probation for his 2015 conviction.\n\nAnderson\u2019s earlier counterfeiting activities involved common accomplices (his co-defendants), a\n\ncommon purpose (the acquisition of cash and valuable items), and an identical modus operandi\n\n(passing counterfeit bills at local businesses). \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(i). These uncharged\n\noffenses of making and passing counterfeit currency thus made up a common scheme or plan with\n\nthe conduct for which Anderson was in fact charged, and they therefore constitute relevant conduct\n\nunder the Guidelines. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Because this relevant conduct occurred before June 2019\n\n(i.e., while Anderson was serving a probationary sentence), the district court properly concluded\n\n\n\nof application note 4\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4A1.1(d) (now application note 5\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a7 4A1.1(e)) for another day.\n                                               -9-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nthat Anderson was subject to a two-point increase in his criminal history score under \u00a7 4A1.1(d).\n\nThe district court therefore did not plainly err.\n\n                                                    III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                          NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION\n                                 File Name: 24a0026n.06\n\n                                         Case No. 23-1127\n\n                             UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS                              FILED\n                                  FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT                                Jan 19, 2024\n                                                                              KELLY L.

Eugene Anderson appeals his fifty-one-month\n\nsentence for counterfeiting United States currency. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n         In March 2021, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Anderson with\n\nconspiracy to make and pass counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 1); making counterfeit U.S. currency\n\n(Count 2); and passing counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 3).          According to the indictment,\n\nAnderson used several printers, a scanner and a paper cutter to alter legitimate federal reserve notes\n\nso that the bills displayed higher face values. Anderson and his co-defendants then passed the\n\ncounterfeit bills at numerous businesses in Southwest Michigan, obtaining \u201cgenuine United States\n\ncurrency and other things of value\u201d in exchange. DE 1, Indictment, Page ID 2. In an interview\n\nfollowing his arrest, Anderson admitted that he had been counterfeiting currency for about two\n\nyears.\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n       At his arraignment, Anderson pled not guilty, and the magistrate judge released him on a\n\n$20,000 appearance bond. As a condition of pretrial release, the magistrate ordered that Anderson\n\nreside at a community correction facility and submit to drug testing and treatment. Roughly two\n\nmonths after his placement at the assigned facility, Anderson submitted a positive drug test. And\n\nthe following day, he absconded. A warrant for Anderson\u2019s arrest then issued, but Anderson\n\nremained missing for the next fourteen months. Finally, in August 2022, police re-apprehended\n\nAnderson while responding to a report of customers attempting to use counterfeit bills at a\n\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurant.     Shortly after his arrest, Anderson pled guilty to the three-count\n\nindictment.\n\n       In advance of sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report.\n\nTwo elements of that report provide the backdrop to Anderson\u2019s appeal.             First, based on\n\nAnderson\u2019s flight from pretrial supervision, Anderson\u2019s offense level computation (a) included a\n\ntwo-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and (b) did not include a\n\ntwo-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Second, based on a\n\nterm of probation connected with a 2015 check forgery conviction, Anderson\u2019s criminal history\n\nscore included a two-point enhancement \u2014 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) \u2014 for committing\n\nthe instant offenses \u201cwhile under a criminal justice sentence.\u201d DE 130, Presentence Report, Page\n\nID 669.\n\n       At sentencing, Anderson objected only to the probation officer\u2019s failure to credit him for\n\nacceptance of responsibility. After hearing argument from both parties, the district court overruled\n\nthe objection. Accepting the probation officer\u2019s calculation of a total offense level of 15 and a\n\ncriminal history category of VI, the court then sentenced Anderson to a top-of-the-range sentence\n\nof 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal timely followed.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n                                                II.\n\n       Anderson challenges the district court\u2019s sentence on two grounds, which we discuss in turn.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Anderson first argues that the district court erred in denying him credit for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility because he pled guilty, participated in the presentence interview, and expressed\n\nremorse for his crimes. Before addressing the merits of this argument, we note that the applicable\n\nstandard of review in this context remains unsettled. See United States v. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">933 F.3d 605</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n611\u201312 (6th Cir. 2019) (compiling conflicting cases); see also United States v. Guerrero, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">76 F.4th\n\n519</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (6th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[T]he standard of review for [appeals from the denial of a reduction\n\nunder \u00a7 3E1.1] is not entirely clear.\u201d); United States v. Cadieux, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">846 F. App\u2019x 389</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (6th Cir.\n\n2021) (noting the absence of \u201cclear consensus . . . about what standard of review applies in appeals\n\nchallenging the application of [\u00a7 3E1.1]\u201d). Nevertheless, because Anderson\u2019s objection fails even\n\nunder de novo review, we, like several panels before us, defer resolution of this open question to\n\na later date. See, e.g., Cadieux, 846 F. App\u2019x at 392 (\u201cBecause Cadieux\u2019s arguments fail even\n\nunder de novo review (the most favorable standard to him), we \u2018leave resolution of the standard\n\nof review for another day.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Thomas, 933 F.3d at 610). Thus, we turn to the merits.\n\n       The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the\n\ndefendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense[.]\u201d           U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 3E1.1(a). And when a defendant pleads guilty and admits the conduct comprising the offense\n\nof conviction, he provides \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1\n\ncmt. n.3. But this does not mean that a defendant who pleads guilty is \u201centitled to an [acceptance\n\nof responsibility] adjustment . . . as a matter of right.\u201d Id. Instead, the Guidelines commentary\n\nprovides district courts with a variety of relevant factors to weigh, including the voluntariness of\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nthe defendant\u2019s withdrawal from criminal conduct, the timeliness of his acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, and the consistency \u2014 or inconsistency \u2014 of his conduct with his professed\n\nacceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. nn. 1(b), 1(h) and 3. And of particular\n\nrelevance here, conduct which justifies application of a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal\n\nconduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4. For \u201c[o]nly in an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 case may a defendant\n\nreceive both an offense-level increase for obstruction and an offense-level decrease for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.\u201d Thomas, 933 F.3d at 612 (quoting \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4).\n\n       Anderson contends that his conduct represents one such extraordinary case. Specifically,\n\nAnderson highlights that after his re-arrest, he \u201c[pled] guilty to all charges,\u201d \u201cwas totally\n\nforthcoming in terms of his involvement in the offense conduct,\u201d and \u201cexpressed sincere remorse.\u201d\n\nCA6 R. 14, Appellant Br., at 10. Anderson also draws a parallel between his conduct and that of\n\nthe defendant in United States v. Gregory, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">315 F.3d 637</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2003), who this court held was\n\nentitled to credit for acceptance of responsibility, despite his attempt to shield his co-defendant\n\nfrom prosecution by instructing her not to cooperate with law enforcement. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 640\u201341. Like\n\nGregory, Anderson argues that he too \u201cabandoned his attempt to obstruct justice and made a great\n\neffort to accept responsibility,\u201d entitling him to a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1(a). CA6 R.\n\n14, Appellant Br., at 12.\n\n       We find Anderson\u2019s contentions meritless, for several reasons. First, neither the timeliness\n\nnor voluntariness of Anderson\u2019s acceptance of responsibility supports application of the \u00a7 3E1.1(a)\n\nreduction. After his failed drug test and flight from pretrial supervision, Anderson remained a\n\nfugitive from justice for over fourteen months. On any one of the 428 days he spent at large,\n\nAnderson could have turned himself in and willingly accepted responsibility for his actions. But\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nAnderson did not do so, choosing to instead force law enforcement to catch him. And even at that\n\njuncture, when police had found him and his re-apprehension was all but guaranteed, Anderson\n\ncontinued to skirt responsibility by providing arresting officers with a false name and date of birth.\n\nMoreover, at the time of his arrest, Anderson was again in possession of counterfeit currency.\n\nThese actions are patently inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, and they reflect an\n\nunavoidable truth: Anderson did not voluntarily own up to his actions; he merely ran out of\n\noptions. See United States v. Starks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">64 F. App\u2019x 501</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (6th Cir. 2003) (denying credit for\n\nacceptance of responsibility where defendant absconded from pretrial detention for nine months.)\n\n       On top of this, Anderson fails to demonstrate that any of his post-arrest conduct renders his\n\ncase \u201cextraordinary.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.4. \u201cTo qualify as an extraordinary circumstance, a\n\ndefendant must do something more than merely plead guilty following his obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nStarks, 64 F.

Here, the only evidence of \u201cextraordinary\u201d conduct that Anderson musters is his guilty\n\nplea, his participation in the presentence investigation process, and his expressions of remorse.\n\nThese acts, though praiseworthy, constitute an entirely ordinary course of conduct for those faced\n\nwith a criminal indictment. Had Anderson quickly turned himself in after his escape, his\n\nimmediate change of heart might have provided grounds for deeming his actions \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nSee Harper, 246 F.3d at 528 (\u201cFor example, if a defendant awaiting trial escapes from custody but\n\nthen immediately turns himself into authorities, this could constitute an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 case in\n\nwhich a defendant accepts responsibility subsequent to an attempt to obstruct justice.\u201d). But\n\nAnderson chose a different path. His guilty plea and expressions of remorse demonstrate little\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nmore than resignation to the failure of his attempted obstruction, and they fall well short of\n\nextraordinary. Id.\n\n       Finally, Anderson\u2019s reliance on our decision in Gregory is misplaced. There, Kenneth\n\nGregory, a prisoner at Federal Correctional Institute, Memphis, enlisted his sister\u2019s help smuggling\n\ndrugs into prison. Gregory, 315 F.3d at 639. Prison officials quickly foiled the scheme, and when\n\ninterviewed by federal investigators, Gregory admitted his culpability and agreed to cooperate in\n\ntheir investigation. Id. Hoping to keep his accomplice out of trouble, however, Gregory later sent\n\nhis sister a letter advising her not to cooperate with law enforcement and suggesting innocent\n\nexplanations that she could use to defend her conduct. Id. But on the very same day that he sent\n\nthe letter, Gregory reversed course. Id. During an interview with federal investigators, Gregory\n\ncalled his sister, encouraged her to cooperate in the investigation, and put her on the phone with\n\nthe federal agent who was interviewing him. Id.\n\n       Despite his attempted obstruction, for which Gregory received a two-level enhancement\n\nunder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a panel of this court found that Gregory was entitled to credit for\n\nacceptance of responsibility as well. Gregory, 315 F.3d at 640\u201341. The court analogized\n\nGregory\u2019s actions to those of the defendant in United States v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">176 F.3d 301</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n\n1999), who received a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1 after he \u201crecanted his trial testimony\n\nand moved to withdraw his plea agreement, subjecting the court to a hearing on the issue, before\n\nrestating his original position and accepting responsibility.\u201d Id. at 641 (quoting Williams, 176 F.3d\n\nat 311). And the court observed that not only had Gregory \u201cnever denied his own responsibility\n\nand guilt,\u201d but further that \u201c[a]ll of [Gregory\u2019s] obstructive conduct [had] predated his indictment.\u201d\n\nId.   Given these \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances, the court remanded Gregory\u2019s case for\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nresentencing with instructions to downwardly adjust his offense level for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility. Id. at 644.\n\n        The circumstances surrounding Anderson\u2019s ultimate admission of guilt contrast markedly\n\nwith the facts this court confronted in Gregory. Notwithstanding his inculpatory statements to\n\npolice during his first arrest, Anderson initially denied his own responsibility and guilt by pleading\n\nnot guilty. And unlike Gregory, most of Anderson\u2019s obstructive conduct postdated his indictment.\n\nFurthermore, Anderson\u2019s obstructive conduct lasted well over a year, while Gregory managed to\n\nnullify his attempted obstruction within a matter of hours. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,\n\nGregory voluntarily reversed his attempted obstruction, while Anderson surrendered to law\n\nenforcement only when left with no other option. Anderson no doubt had the opportunity to\n\ndemonstrate the same extraordinary conduct that Gregory exhibited, but he chose not to.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility\n\nunder \u00a7 3E1.1.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        Anderson next objects to the calculation of his criminal history score, challenging the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that his offense conduct overlapped with his probationary period for a\n\nprior conviction. Because Anderson failed to raise this objection before the district court, we\n\nreview his criminal history scoring for plain error. United States v. Vonner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">516 F.3d 382</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385\n\n(6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). To meet this burden, Anderson must show that the district court\u2019s\n\ncalculation constituted (1) an error, (2) that is obvious and clear, (3) that affected his substantial\n\nrights, and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Prater, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">766 F.3d 501</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (6th Cir. 2014). We find that Anderson fails to make\n\nsuch a showing.\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\n       The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the district courts to add two points to a defendant\u2019s\n\ncriminal history score \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal\n\njustice sentence, including probation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d).1 The parties agree that Anderson\n\ncompleted the term of probation connected with his 2015 check forgery conviction in June 2019.\n\nThey disagree, however, as to when Anderson\u2019s offense conduct in the instant case began. Citing\n\nthe indictment and the government\u2019s factual recitation at his change-of-plea hearing, Anderson\n\ncontends that he pled guilty to \u201cconduct occurring between September 28, 2019, and January 20,\n\n2020,\u201d thus ruling out any overlap with his term of probation. CA6 R. 14, Appellant Br., at 14.\n\nThe government, on the other hand, contends that Anderson\u2019s offense conduct includes all\n\n\u201crelevant conduct\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, which would capture both (1) the 2018 and\n\n2019 counterfeiting that Anderson admitted to when initially arrested and (2) Anderson\u2019s\n\nproduction and use of a counterfeit bill at a CVS in March 2019. We find that the government\u2019s\n\nposition represents the correct application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n       The application notes to \u00a7 4A1.1(d) state that the provision\u2019s two-point increase applies \u201cif\n\nthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under\n\nany criminal justice sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) cmt. n.4 (emphasis added).2 In this case, the\n\n\n1\n  Note that the district court sentenced Anderson under the 2021 version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines, so we reference and cite to the 2021 version in this opinion. The provision discussed\nherein, \u00a7 4A1.1(d) in the 2021 version, is now codified in the 2023 Sentencing Guidelines at\n\u00a7 4A1.1(e).\n2\n  The government raises (and dismisses) the possibility that application note 4 impermissibly\nexpands \u00a7 4A1.1(d)\u2019s scope, as would run contrary to Kisor v. Wilkie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019)</span><pre class=\"inline\">. But\nAnderson makes no such argument. See Georgia-Pac. Consumer Prods. LP v.

And even he did, his burden under plain error review would be to\npoint to \u201cbinding case law that answers the question\u201d in his favor. Bullard v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">937 F.3d 654</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting United States v.

Accordingly, we leave discussion of the propriety\n                                               -8-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v. Anderson\n\n\nthree counts to which Anderson pled guilty were grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2),\n\ntherefore, Anderson\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes \u201call acts and omissions [that he] committed,\n\naided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused,\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A),\n\nand which involved \u201cthe same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of\n\nconviction.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Anderson\u2019s counterfeiting activities prior to June 2019 constituted\n\n\u201cthe same course of conduct\u201d as his late 2019 and early 2020 counterfeiting if the two were\n\n\u201csufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they [were] part\n\nof a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d         \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(ii).\n\nAlternatively, Anderson\u2019s prior counterfeiting made up a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d with his later\n\ncounterfeiting if the two were \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor,\n\nsuch as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(i).\n\n       Applying the foregoing Guideline provisions and interpretive comments, we conclude that\n\nAnderson committed part of the instant offense while on probation for his 2015 conviction.\n\nAnderson\u2019s earlier counterfeiting activities involved common accomplices (his co-defendants), a\n\ncommon purpose (the acquisition of cash and valuable items), and an identical modus operandi\n\n(passing counterfeit bills at local businesses). \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) cmt. n.5(B)(i). These uncharged\n\noffenses of making and passing counterfeit currency thus made up a common scheme or plan with\n\nthe conduct for which Anderson was in fact charged, and they therefore constitute relevant conduct\n\nunder the Guidelines. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Because this relevant conduct occurred before June 2019\n\n(i.e., while Anderson was serving a probationary sentence), the district court properly concluded\n\n\n\nof application note 4\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4A1.1(d) (now application note 5\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a7 4A1.1(e)) for another day.\n                                               -9-\n\fNo. 23-1127, United States v.

Farrell Marcum has an extensive and violent criminal history\n\ndating back to 1984. In 2021, Marcum shot a man in the leg outside Marcum\u2019s own property, and\n\npolice found a loaded gun in his home. He was charged with possessing a firearm as a felon and\n\npleaded guilty. Because many of Marcum\u2019s convictions happened well in the past, only two were\n\nrecent enough to count toward his criminal-history points. Accordingly, the Presentence Report\n\nplaced him in the relatively low criminal-history category of II.\n\n       At sentencing, the district court departed upward, deciding that the more appropriate\n\ncategory for Marcum, based on his nearly forty years of consistent criminal activity and the\n\nlikelihood of recidivism, was category IV. The court then sentenced Marcum to 71 months of\n\nimprisonment\u2014the upper end of the adjusted Sentencing Guidelines range calculated for a\n\ncategory-IV offender. Marcum argues that this sentence is both procedurally and substantively\n\nunreasonable. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in either respect, we affirm.\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       On March 29, 2021, Marcum shot a man in the leg, breaking his femur. The man was on\n\nMarcum\u2019s property, but he was in his own car, attempting to leave after Marcum had commanded\n\nhim to do so. Upon learning that Marcum was the shooter and that he was a convicted felon, police\n\nexecuted a warrant at his home. There, police found a loaded 9mm handgun. Marcum was charged\n\nwith and pleaded guilty to one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), being a felon in possession\n\nof a firearm. The district court sentenced him to 71 months of imprisonment. Marcum was 59 when\n\nthe court imposed this contested sentence.\n\n       Marcum\u2019s criminal history is substantial. In 1984, he stabbed a man in the throat with a\n\npair of hemostats at a Cincinnati bar, and assaulted a police officer upon arrest. For that, he spent\n\nless than four years in prison. A few months after being paroled, Marcum was convicted of DUI\n\nand fined. Two years later he was again caught driving drunk and was arrested, but not before\n\nanother fight with police. For that, he was sentenced to three days in jail and fined. Roughly two\n\nyears after that, Marcum rammed his car into a police car and fled as police approached his home\n\non a domestic-dispute call. Upon pursuit, Marcum rammed another police cruiser. For that, he was\n\nsentenced to a year in prison and served two and a half months. A month after his release, he was\n\nagain convicted of DUI and fined.\n\n       In 1992, at age 28, Marcum was sentenced to a year in prison when he tried to sell a\n\nKentucky State Police informant five tablets of Valium. He served two months. At age 34, Marcum\n\nwas convicted in federal court of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Police found him passed\n\nout in a car with three loaded guns in the passenger seat\u2014one of which was stolen. The\n\ninvestigation revealed that Marcum had obtained the stolen gun after pistol-whipping its owner\n\nmultiple times, forcing him to strip, and stealing his clothes. The federal court sentenced him to\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n103 months of imprisonment. He subsequently violated his supervised-release conditions but was\n\nnot reincarcerated.\n\n       In 2006, at age 42, Marcum was convicted in state court of fleeing and evading police. Two\n\nyears later, he was convicted in federal court of attempting to possess and distribute cocaine. For\n\nthese crimes, he served a total of one day in jail and was given four years of supervised release. In\n\n2014, at age 50, and again in 2015, at 51, Marcum was convicted of possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance. Since then, and prior to the incident at the heart of this appeal, his only run-ins with the\n\nlaw were moving-vehicle violations.\n\n       Because of the age of most of his convictions, none of Marcum\u2019s conduct before 2014\n\nresulted in criminal-history points. Marcum was assigned a criminal-history score of three (for his\n\ntwo drug-possession charges at age 50 and 51), which established a criminal-history category of\n\nII. Coupled with a total offense level of 21, the recommended Guidelines sentencing range was 41\n\nto 51 months.\n\n       At sentencing, the district court departed upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1),\n\nincreasing Marcum\u2019s criminal-history category to IV. The court outlined Marcum\u2019s extensive\n\ncriminal history and focused on the violent nature of much of it. It then cited empirical data from\n\nthe United States Sentencing Commission and determined that Marcum\u2019s particular criminal\n\nhistory and likelihood of recidivism put him more in line with individuals in category IV. The court\n\nconsidered Marcum\u2019s age and determined that it counseled against placing him in criminal-history\n\ncategory V, despite the seriousness and frequency of his criminal conduct. In the end, the court\n\nemphasized that Marcum\u2019s likelihood of recidivism, the seriousness and nature of his past conduct,\n\nprevious lenient sentences, lack of evidence of those sentences acting as deterrents, and the need\n\nto protect the public supported an increase to category IV.\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n       Adjusted for the criminal-history category increase, Marcum then faced a Guidelines range\n\nof 57 to 71 months of imprisonment. The court analyzed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors\n\nand imposed a sentence of 71 months. Its reasoning mirrored that behind its choice to depart\n\nupward\u2014Marcum\u2019s extensive and serious criminal past, the seriousness of the present crime, and\n\nthus that a longer sentence was necessary to provide deterrence and to protect the public.\n\n       Marcum now appeals both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s sentencing process and its ultimate decision for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Parrish, 915 F.3d 1043, 1046\u201347 (6th Cir. 2019). Accordingly, we\n\nreview the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo, giving\n\ndeference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts. United States v. Abdalla,\n\n972 F.3d 838, 850 (6th Cir. 2020).\n\n                                     A. Procedural Reasonableness\n\n       The question of procedural reasonableness focuses on how the district court calculated the\n\nsentence. The court must \u201cproperly calculate the guidelines range, treat that range as advisory,\n\nconsider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), refrain from considering impermissible\n\nfactors, select the sentence based on facts that are not clearly erroneous, and adequately explain\n\nwhy it chose the sentence.\u201d United States v. Rayyan, 885 F.3d 436, 440 (6th Cir. 2018) (citing Gall\n\nv. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007)). Marcum\u2019s sole procedural argument on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court failed to adequately explain the reasons for its upward departure.\n\n       If a defendant\u2019s presumptive criminal-history category \u201csubstantially under-represents the\n\nseriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\n\nother crimes,\u201d a sentencing court may depart upward from the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1).\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\nBut in doing so, the court must provide the specific reasons for its action. Id. \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(1)\n\n(emphasis added); see also United States v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 205\u201306 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2)). Marcum\u2019s primary argument is that the court did not provide sufficiently\n\nspecific reasons in writing for its upward departure.\n\n         But this is simply inaccurate. Here, the district court provided\u2014in writing\u2014an adequate\n\nbasis for its upward departure. It stated three specific reasons for assigning Marcum a criminal-\n\nhistory category of IV: \u201c(1) the serious nature of his prior criminal history; (2) past lenient\n\ntreatment; and (3) the likelihood of recidivism.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 2. Further, as Marcum\n\nhimself notes, the court listed additional reasons1 for its sentence, including \u201c(1) the need to\n\nprovide specific deterrence to the defendant; (2) the need to protect the public in light of the\n\nlikelihood of the defendant re-offending when released; (3) [the] serious nature of the instant\n\noffense which included the discharge of a firearm and injury to a third party; (4) the need to\n\npromote respect for the law; and (5) just punishment.\u201d Id. at 4. These reasons are specific enough.\n\nSee United States v. Potts, 947 F.3d 357, 371 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing United States v. Dexta, 470\n\nF.3d 612, 614\u201315 (6th Cir. 2006)) (\u201c[W]e do not require \u2018magic words,\u2019 nor do we require a\n\nmechanical recitation of every factor or provision relied upon by the district court.\u201d). Our case law\n\noverwhelmingly supports this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Till, No. 22-1841, 2023 WL\n\n8651266, at *5 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2023) (holding that the district court\u2019s statements that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s criminal history did not adequately reflect the likelihood of reoffending and the need\n\nto deter were specific enough for a \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure); United States v. Mabry, No. 22-\n\n\n1\n  These additional reasons are listed as justifications for a \u201cvariance.\u201d [DE 30-1 at 89]. The district court specifically\nstated, however, that it was imposing an upward departure based on \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Moreover, the court clearly\ndeparted when it put Marcum in a higher criminal-history category and then imposed a sentence based on the \u201cnew\u201d\nrange of 57\u201371 months. Either way, the requirement that a sentencing court explain its reasoning for deviating from a\nGuidelines calculation is essentially the same whether the deviation is treated as a departure or a variance. See Johnson,\n640 F.3d at 205; see also id. at n.5 & n.6.\n\n\n                                                          -5-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n1576, 2023 WL 4183456, at *3 (6th Cir. June 26, 2023) (same); Potts, 947 F.3d at 371 (holding\n\nthat concerns about recidivism were enough for a four-category criminal-history upward departure\n\npursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1)).\n\n       And even if the district court\u2019s written reasons were lacking, the court explained its reasons\n\nfor departure in greater detail during the sentencing hearing. This would cure any deficiencies in\n\nthe court\u2019s written statement of reasons. See Mabry, 2023 WL 4183456, at *3 (\u201cEven if [the\n\nwritten] explanation did not have the requisite level of specificity, the district court\u2019s oral\n\nexplanation at the sentencing hearing . . . was sufficient to compensate.\u201d (cleaned up)) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Zobel, 696 F.3d 558, 567 (6th Cir. 2012)). The court discussed Marcum\u2019s extensive\n\ncriminal history and how that influenced its determination of the appropriate criminal-history\n\ncategory in the context of \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). The court specifically noted that the upward departure\n\nwas based on a strong likelihood of recidivism, and explained how the seriousness of Marcum\u2019s\n\nprevious convictions, the violent nature of his criminal history, and the fact that the seriousness of\n\nthat history was understated all factored into the threat of recidivism. And the court even spent\n\nsignificant time discussing empirical data on the connection between recidivism rates and prior\n\ncriminal activity.\n\n       Moreover, the court provided a detailed summation of its rationale in the specific context\n\nof a \u00a7 4A1.3-based upward departure:\n\n       So when I do consider seriousness of his past conduct, the nature of that conduct;\n       likelihood of recidivism based upon this information that I have just reviewed and\n       provided to the parties; similar adult conduct not resulting in convictions or\n       previous lenient sentences for offenses, and whether these previous sentences have\n       provided a deterrent effect; as well as the necessity of isolating the defendant from\n       the community, these factors would indicate that an increase to Criminal History\n       Category IV would be warranted under Section 4A1.3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\nSentencing Tr. at 21. In short, the district court provided a more than adequate explanation for why\n\nit chose to depart pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Accordingly, Marcum has not shown that his sentence\n\nis procedurally unreasonable.\n\n                                   B. Substantive Reasonableness\n\n       The question of substantive reasonableness focuses on the length of the sentence as\n\nopposed to how the district court imposed it. In essence, we look to see whether the sentence is\n\n\u201cneedlessly harsh or inappropriately lenient.\u201d Potts, 947 F.3d at 371. When we review the\n\nreasonableness of an upward departure, we consider the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past\n\ncriminal conduct, the likelihood of recidivism, prior similar conduct not resulting in convictions,\n\nprevious lenient sentences, deterrence, the need to protect the community, and the length of time\n\nnecessary to achieve rehabilitation, if rehabilitation is possible. United States v. Hardy, 643 F.3d\n\n143, 158 (6th Cir. 2011). \u201cRegardless of whether we would have imposed the same sentence, we\n\nmust afford due deference to the district court's decision to determine the appropriate length of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s sentence, so long as it is justified in light of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d 568, 591 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       Here, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to depart pursuant to\n\n\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) and then impose a sentence at the top end of the new calculated range. Given\n\nMarcum\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history, the fact that the crime of conviction here again\n\ninvolved grievous bodily harm to another person, and Marcum\u2019s continued commission of crimes\n\nover a period of decades, the district court clearly did not abuse its discretion when applying these\n\nfacts to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposing an above-Guidelines sentence. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Hall, 664 F. App\u2019x 479, 485 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that an upward departure from criminal-\n\nhistory category IV to category VI, and an additional upward variance, was substantively\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\nreasonable given the defendant\u2019s recidivist tendencies and the district court\u2019s proper consideration\n\nof the sentencing factors); Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d at 591 (holding that a \u201cparticularly harsh\u201d\n\nupward departure was substantively reasonable based on the defendant\u2019s \u201csignificant criminal\n\nhistory, his repeated recidivism, the seriousness of his offenses, [and] the nature and circumstances\n\nof his latest offense . . . .\u201d). Because the sentence is justified in light of the relevant sentencing\n\nfactors, we must afford the district court due deference. See Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d at 591\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n       Other than objecting to how the district court interpreted and applied the aforementioned\n\nfactors in fashioning its sentence, Marcum specifically argues that the two-criminal-history-\n\ncategory departure was erroneous. It is unclear whether Marcum is arguing that assigning him a\n\ncategory-IV criminal history is plainly substantively unreasonable or that the district court did not\n\nproperly consider instead a one-level increase to category III. But his arguments here mostly\n\nrecycle his arguments concerning procedural reasonableness. As stated above, the district court\n\nadequately explained why it chose to depart from criminal-history category II to category IV.\n\nMoreover, the court was under no obligation to explain its rationale in rejecting all other possible\n\nsentences. Potts, 947 F.3d at 371 (\u201c[W]e do not require the district court to cover every possible\n\nsentencing alternative. We simply ask whether the district court showed its work such that we can\n\nmeaningfully review how and why it crafted a sentence.\u201d) (citing United States v. Chiolo, 643 F.3d\n\n177, 182 (6th Cir. 2011)).\n\n       Accordingly, Marcum has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                         NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION\n                                File Name: 24a0023n.06\n\n                                            No. 22-6093\n\n                           UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                               FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT                                     FILED\n                                                                                       Jan 19, 2024\n                                                          )                    KELLY L.

Farrell Marcum has an extensive and violent criminal history\n\ndating back to 1984. In 2021, Marcum shot a man in the leg outside Marcum\u2019s own property, and\n\npolice found a loaded gun in his home. He was charged with possessing a firearm as a felon and\n\npleaded guilty. Because many of Marcum\u2019s convictions happened well in the past, only two were\n\nrecent enough to count toward his criminal-history points. Accordingly, the Presentence Report\n\nplaced him in the relatively low criminal-history category of II.\n\n       At sentencing, the district court departed upward, deciding that the more appropriate\n\ncategory for Marcum, based on his nearly forty years of consistent criminal activity and the\n\nlikelihood of recidivism, was category IV. The court then sentenced Marcum to 71 months of\n\nimprisonment\u2014the upper end of the adjusted Sentencing Guidelines range calculated for a\n\ncategory-IV offender. Marcum argues that this sentence is both procedurally and substantively\n\nunreasonable. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in either respect, we affirm.\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       On March 29, 2021, Marcum shot a man in the leg, breaking his femur. The man was on\n\nMarcum\u2019s property, but he was in his own car, attempting to leave after Marcum had commanded\n\nhim to do so. Upon learning that Marcum was the shooter and that he was a convicted felon, police\n\nexecuted a warrant at his home. There, police found a loaded 9mm handgun. Marcum was charged\n\nwith and pleaded guilty to one count of violating </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922</span><pre class=\"inline\">(g)(1), being a felon in possession\n\nof a firearm. The district court sentenced him to 71 months of imprisonment. Marcum was 59 when\n\nthe court imposed this contested sentence.\n\n       Marcum\u2019s criminal history is substantial. In 1984, he stabbed a man in the throat with a\n\npair of hemostats at a Cincinnati bar, and assaulted a police officer upon arrest. For that, he spent\n\nless than four years in prison. A few months after being paroled, Marcum was convicted of DUI\n\nand fined. Two years later he was again caught driving drunk and was arrested, but not before\n\nanother fight with police. For that, he was sentenced to three days in jail and fined. Roughly two\n\nyears after that, Marcum rammed his car into a police car and fled as police approached his home\n\non a domestic-dispute call. Upon pursuit, Marcum rammed another police cruiser. For that, he was\n\nsentenced to a year in prison and served two and a half months. A month after his release, he was\n\nagain convicted of DUI and fined.\n\n       In 1992, at age 28, Marcum was sentenced to a year in prison when he tried to sell a\n\nKentucky State Police informant five tablets of Valium. He served two months. At age 34, Marcum\n\nwas convicted in federal court of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Police found him passed\n\nout in a car with three loaded guns in the passenger seat\u2014one of which was stolen. The\n\ninvestigation revealed that Marcum had obtained the stolen gun after pistol-whipping its owner\n\nmultiple times, forcing him to strip, and stealing his clothes. The federal court sentenced him to\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n103 months of imprisonment. He subsequently violated his supervised-release conditions but was\n\nnot reincarcerated.\n\n       In 2006, at age 42, Marcum was convicted in state court of fleeing and evading police. Two\n\nyears later, he was convicted in federal court of attempting to possess and distribute cocaine. For\n\nthese crimes, he served a total of one day in jail and was given four years of supervised release. In\n\n2014, at age 50, and again in 2015, at 51, Marcum was convicted of possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance. Since then, and prior to the incident at the heart of this appeal, his only run-ins with the\n\nlaw were moving-vehicle violations.\n\n       Because of the age of most of his convictions, none of Marcum\u2019s conduct before 2014\n\nresulted in criminal-history points. Marcum was assigned a criminal-history score of three (for his\n\ntwo drug-possession charges at age 50 and 51), which established a criminal-history category of\n\nII. Coupled with a total offense level of 21, the recommended Guidelines sentencing range was 41\n\nto 51 months.\n\n       At sentencing, the district court departed upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1),\n\nincreasing Marcum\u2019s criminal-history category to IV. The court outlined Marcum\u2019s extensive\n\ncriminal history and focused on the violent nature of much of it. It then cited empirical data from\n\nthe United States Sentencing Commission and determined that Marcum\u2019s particular criminal\n\nhistory and likelihood of recidivism put him more in line with individuals in category IV. The court\n\nconsidered Marcum\u2019s age and determined that it counseled against placing him in criminal-history\n\ncategory V, despite the seriousness and frequency of his criminal conduct. In the end, the court\n\nemphasized that Marcum\u2019s likelihood of recidivism, the seriousness and nature of his past conduct,\n\nprevious lenient sentences, lack of evidence of those sentences acting as deterrents, and the need\n\nto protect the public supported an increase to category IV.\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\n       Adjusted for the criminal-history category increase, Marcum then faced a Guidelines range\n\nof 57 to 71 months of imprisonment. The court analyzed the </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a) sentencing factors\n\nand imposed a sentence of 71 months. Its reasoning mirrored that behind its choice to depart\n\nupward\u2014Marcum\u2019s extensive and serious criminal past, the seriousness of the present crime, and\n\nthus that a longer sentence was necessary to provide deterrence and to protect the public.\n\n       Marcum now appeals both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s sentencing process and its ultimate decision for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

Procedural Reasonableness\n\n       The question of procedural reasonableness focuses on how the district court calculated the\n\nsentence. The court must \u201cproperly calculate the guidelines range, treat that range as advisory,\n\nconsider the sentencing factors in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a), refrain from considering impermissible\n\nfactors, select the sentence based on facts that are not clearly erroneous, and adequately explain\n\nwhy it chose the sentence.\u201d United States v.

Marcum\u2019s sole procedural argument on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court failed to adequately explain the reasons for its upward departure.\n\n       If a defendant\u2019s presumptive criminal-history category \u201csubstantially under-represents the\n\nseriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\n\nother crimes,\u201d a sentencing court may depart upward from the Guidelines.

Marcum\u2019s primary argument is that the court did not provide sufficiently\n\nspecific reasons in writing for its upward departure.\n\n         But this is simply inaccurate. Here, the district court provided\u2014in writing\u2014an adequate\n\nbasis for its upward departure. It stated three specific reasons for assigning Marcum a criminal-\n\nhistory category of IV: \u201c(1) the serious nature of his prior criminal history; (2) past lenient\n\ntreatment; and (3) the likelihood of recidivism.\u201d Statement of Reasons at 2.

Dec. 14, 2023) (holding that the district court\u2019s statements that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s criminal history did not adequately reflect the likelihood of reoffending and the need\n\nto deter were specific enough for a \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure); United States v. Mabry, No. 22-\n\n\n1\n  These additional reasons are listed as justifications for a \u201cvariance.\u201d [DE 30-1 at 89]. The district court specifically\nstated, however, that it was imposing an upward departure based on \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Moreover, the court clearly\ndeparted when it put Marcum in a higher criminal-history category and then imposed a sentence based on the \u201cnew\u201d\nrange of 57\u201371 months. Either way, the requirement that a sentencing court explain its reasoning for deviating from a\nGuidelines calculation is essentially the same whether the deviation is treated as a departure or a variance.

This would cure any deficiencies in\n\nthe court\u2019s written statement of reasons. See Mabry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL 4183456</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (\u201cEven if [the\n\nwritten] explanation did not have the requisite level of specificity, the district court\u2019s oral\n\nexplanation at the sentencing hearing . . . was sufficient to compensate.\u201d (cleaned up)) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Zobel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">696 F.3d 558</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (6th Cir. 2012)). The court discussed Marcum\u2019s extensive\n\ncriminal history and how that influenced its determination of the appropriate criminal-history\n\ncategory in the context of \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). The court specifically noted that the upward departure\n\nwas based on a strong likelihood of recidivism, and explained how the seriousness of Marcum\u2019s\n\nprevious convictions, the violent nature of his criminal history, and the fact that the seriousness of\n\nthat history was understated all factored into the threat of recidivism. And the court even spent\n\nsignificant time discussing empirical data on the connection between recidivism rates and prior\n\ncriminal activity.\n\n       Moreover, the court provided a detailed summation of its rationale in the specific context\n\nof a \u00a7 4A1.3-based upward departure:\n\n       So when I do consider seriousness of his past conduct, the nature of that conduct;\n       likelihood of recidivism based upon this information that I have just reviewed and\n       provided to the parties; similar adult conduct not resulting in convictions or\n       previous lenient sentences for offenses, and whether these previous sentences have\n       provided a deterrent effect; as well as the necessity of isolating the defendant from\n       the community, these factors would indicate that an increase to Criminal History\n       Category IV would be warranted under Section 4A1.3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\nSentencing Tr. at 21. In short, the district court provided a more than adequate explanation for why\n\nit chose to depart pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Accordingly, Marcum has not shown that his sentence\n\nis procedurally unreasonable.\n\n                                   B. Substantive Reasonableness\n\n       The question of substantive reasonableness focuses on the length of the sentence as\n\nopposed to how the district court imposed it. In essence, we look to see whether the sentence is\n\n\u201cneedlessly harsh or inappropriately lenient.\u201d Potts, 947 F.3d at 371. When we review the\n\nreasonableness of an upward departure, we consider the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past\n\ncriminal conduct, the likelihood of recidivism, prior similar conduct not resulting in convictions,\n\nprevious lenient sentences, deterrence, the need to protect the community, and the length of time\n\nnecessary to achieve rehabilitation, if rehabilitation is possible. United States v. Hardy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">643 F.3d\n\n143</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (6th Cir. 2011). \u201cRegardless of whether we would have imposed the same sentence, we\n\nmust afford due deference to the district court&#x27;s decision to determine the appropriate length of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s sentence, so long as it is justified in light of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Herrera-Zuniga, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">571 F.3d 568</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       Here, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to depart pursuant to\n\n\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) and then impose a sentence at the top end of the new calculated range. Given\n\nMarcum\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history, the fact that the crime of conviction here again\n\ninvolved grievous bodily harm to another person, and Marcum\u2019s continued commission of crimes\n\nover a period of decades, the district court clearly did not abuse its discretion when applying these\n\nfacts to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposing an above-Guidelines sentence. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">664 F. App\u2019x 479</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that an upward departure from criminal-\n\nhistory category IV to category VI, and an additional upward variance, was substantively\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 22-6093, United States v. Marcum\n\n\nreasonable given the defendant\u2019s recidivist tendencies and the district court\u2019s proper consideration\n\nof the sentencing factors); Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d at 591 (holding that a \u201cparticularly harsh\u201d\n\nupward departure was substantively reasonable based on the defendant\u2019s \u201csignificant criminal\n\nhistory, his repeated recidivism, the seriousness of his offenses, [and] the nature and circumstances\n\nof his latest offense . . . .\u201d). Because the sentence is justified in light of the relevant sentencing\n\nfactors, we must afford the district court due deference. See Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d at 591\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n       Other than objecting to how the district court interpreted and applied the aforementioned\n\nfactors in fashioning its sentence, Marcum specifically argues that the two-criminal-history-\n\ncategory departure was erroneous. It is unclear whether Marcum is arguing that assigning him a\n\ncategory-IV criminal history is plainly substantively unreasonable or that the district court did not\n\nproperly consider instead a one-level increase to category III. But his arguments here mostly\n\nrecycle his arguments concerning procedural reasonableness. As stated above, the district court\n\nadequately explained why it chose to depart from criminal-history category II to category IV.\n\nMoreover, the court was under no obligation to explain its rationale in rejecting all other possible\n\nsentences. Potts, 947 F.3d at 371 (\u201c[W]e do not require the district court to cover every possible\n\nsentencing alternative. We simply ask whether the district court showed its work such that we can\n\nmeaningfully review how and why it crafted a sentence.\u201d) (citing United States v.

Marlen Stafford, Jr. escaped from the halfway house where he\n\nwas completing a federal sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Two months later,\n\nhe stopped to eat at a fast-food restaurant. Officers were following him, and they used their patrol\n\ncars to block his vehicle\u2019s exit. Instead of surrendering, Stafford repeatedly rammed the police\n\ncruisers with his car then physically resisted the efforts of seven officers to subdue him. Once\n\nsubdued, he received convictions for felony escape and felon in possession of a firearm. Stafford\n\nchallenges the resulting 60-month sentence on procedural and substantive grounds. We affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Stafford is a thirty-one-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he has resided\n\nhis entire life. He experienced a \u201cvery chaotic childhood\u201d during which he lived in multiple foster\n\nhomes and juvenile residential programs. R.24 at 19. Besides the State, his primary caretakers\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\nduring his formative years were his grandmother and his uncle. Stafford\u2019s uncle has an extensive\n\ncriminal background, as do both of his parents and his paternal grandfather.\n\n       Stafford has a number of prior convictions which involved physically challenging law\n\nenforcement authorities and trying to evade the police.           His first adult conviction was for\n\nattempting to assault, resist, and obstruct police during a traffic stop. Between 2010 and 2014, he\n\nracked up six more sentences for identical and related offenses. As time progressed, his getaways\n\nbecame more creative and reckless. One escape involved leaping out a window. Another entailed\n\ndraining his electronic monitoring device\u2019s battery to hide from his parole officer for months. On\n\ntop of these incidents were escapes by car where he sped away with such fervor that law\n\nenforcement opted not to pursue him out of concern for public safety.\n\n       Today\u2019s conviction arises from another attempted escape as well as weapons possession.\n\nIn 2020, Stafford pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Toward the end of the\n\nsentence imposed for that conviction, the Bureau of Prisons transferred him to a residential\n\ntreatment facility, which let him apply for weekend passes to visit family. On one such weekend,\n\nhe left to see his sister. After a day there, however, she asked him to leave and told the authorities\n\nas much. Officials directed Stafford to return to the facility.\n\n       He did not return. Two months passed before a patrol tracked him down at a fast-food\n\nrestaurant. The police positioned their cars to block him from escaping. Stafford rammed into\n\nboth cruisers for two minutes, apparently trying to move them aside so that he could drive away.\n\nWhen that did not work, he sprinted from the scene as four officers tried to tackle him, injuring\n\nthree in the process. Only after additional officers arrived did the police subdue him.\n\n       Once they handcuffed Stafford and placed him in the patrol car, the officers approached\n\nhis vehicle. A pistol lay on his driver\u2019s side floorboard. It contained nine rounds of ammunition.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\nA two-count indictment charged Stafford with felony escape and being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a), 921(a), 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). He pleaded guilty to both charges\n\nwithout a plea agreement. Stafford\u2019s advisory sentencing range was 37 to 46 months, and the court\n\nsentenced him to 60 months.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       Stafford challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.\n\nBecause he did not raise any procedural challenges to his sentence when given the chance, plain-\n\nerror review applies to that claim. United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir. 2008) (en\n\nbanc). Abuse-of-discretion review applies to his substantive reasonableness claim. United States\n\nv. Smith, 516 F.3d 473, 476 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n       Procedural Reasonableness. Stafford has not shown any obvious procedural mistake in\n\nhis sentence. To err, the district court must miscalculate the guidelines range, incorrectly deem\n\nthe guidelines mandatory, lean on clearly erroneous facts, fail to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing\n\nfactors, or fail to explain the reasons for the sentence. See United States v. Rayyan, 885 F.3d 436,\n\n440 (6th Cir. 2018). Nothing of the sort happened here. The district court accurately assessed the\n\nguidelines range, viewed the guidelines as advisory, relied on appropriate facts, and discussed each\n\napplicable \u00a7 3553(a) factor. On top of that, the court explained why the upward variance from the\n\nadvisory range supported deterrence, punishment, respect for the law, public protection, and\n\ncorrectional \u201cprogramming for anger management, because [Stafford] seems to not be able to\n\ncontrol himself in situations where law enforcement is in the area.\u201d R.36 at 23.\n\n       Stafford counters that the district court did not adequately explain why it imposed a 14-\n\nmonth increase over the advisory guidelines range. Yet we do not require district courts to state\n\nwhy they chose a certain sentence instead of another\u2014to the degree of granularity, say, of 60\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\ninstead of 55 months. See United States v. Sexton, 889 F.3d 262, 266 (6th Cir. 2018); see also\n\nUnited States v. Petrus, 588 F.3d 347, 355 (6th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[B]revity does not constitute reversible\n\nerror.\u201d). We need only sufficient details to conduct meaningful review. See United States v.\n\nGrossman, 513 F.3d 592, 595 (6th Cir. 2008). Here, the district court gave us plenty of evidence\n\nthat it adequately considered the relevant statutory factors and had ample reasons for varying\n\nupward. See id. The district court fully addressed Stafford\u2019s extensive criminal history of related\n\nescape and firearms convictions and why he deserved a five-year sentence in this instance. As the\n\ncourt explained, Stafford\u2019s instant felon-in-possession offense occurred just a short time after his\n\nprior felon-in-possession conviction. And while resisting arrest, he battled and bruised multiple\n\npolice officers, causing them to write that he \u201cendangered the lives of each one of us.\u201d R.36 at 15.\n\nHaving put officers and other members of the public at risk, the court was concerned that he would\n\ndo so again in the future. Nothing procedurally amiss, plain or otherwise, occurred.\n\n        Substantive Reasonableness. Stafford also contests the length of his sentence, claiming it\n\nis \u201ctoo long.\u201d Rayyan, 885 F.3d at 442. Weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and deciding whether to\n\naccept the advisory guidelines range in a given case turns on experience-driven judgment, not\n\nmath. See United States v. Woolridge, 64 F.4th 757, 762\u201363 (6th Cir. 2023). A court may vary\n\nup or down from the guidelines recommendation when the facts and circumstances of a given\n\ncrime and defendant warrant it. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1); see, e.g., United States v. Pyles, 904 F.3d\n\n422, 426 (6th Cir. 2018). In this instance, the district court reasonably determined that Stafford\n\ndeserved a five-year sentence given his recidivism and the threat he posed to public safety. Beyond\n\nthe crimes incorporated into the guidelines computations, the district court contemplated his\n\nunpursued flights from police, his recalcitrance, and his pattern of resisting arrest in dangerous\n\nways.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\n       Stafford submits that his sentence is too long because the guidelines range already\n\naccounted for his extensive history of related crimes, making any upward variance unfair and\n\nunjustified. But he overlooks the reality that the guidelines range is advisory, which is why district\n\ncourts receive considerable discretion in the first instance in deciding whether to vary up or down\n\nfrom the proposed range. See Rayyan, 885 F.3d at 442.

Marlen Stafford, Jr. escaped from the halfway house where he\n\nwas completing a federal sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Two months later,\n\nhe stopped to eat at a fast-food restaurant. Officers were following him, and they used their patrol\n\ncars to block his vehicle\u2019s exit. Instead of surrendering, Stafford repeatedly rammed the police\n\ncruisers with his car then physically resisted the efforts of seven officers to subdue him. Once\n\nsubdued, he received convictions for felony escape and felon in possession of a firearm. Stafford\n\nchallenges the resulting 60-month sentence on procedural and substantive grounds. We affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Stafford is a thirty-one-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he has resided\n\nhis entire life. He experienced a \u201cvery chaotic childhood\u201d during which he lived in multiple foster\n\nhomes and juvenile residential programs. R.24 at 19. Besides the State, his primary caretakers\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\nduring his formative years were his grandmother and his uncle. Stafford\u2019s uncle has an extensive\n\ncriminal background, as do both of his parents and his paternal grandfather.\n\n       Stafford has a number of prior convictions which involved physically challenging law\n\nenforcement authorities and trying to evade the police.           His first adult conviction was for\n\nattempting to assault, resist, and obstruct police during a traffic stop. Between 2010 and 2014, he\n\nracked up six more sentences for identical and related offenses. As time progressed, his getaways\n\nbecame more creative and reckless. One escape involved leaping out a window. Another entailed\n\ndraining his electronic monitoring device\u2019s battery to hide from his parole officer for months. On\n\ntop of these incidents were escapes by car where he sped away with such fervor that law\n\nenforcement opted not to pursue him out of concern for public safety.\n\n       Today\u2019s conviction arises from another attempted escape as well as weapons possession.\n\nIn 2020, Stafford pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Toward the end of the\n\nsentence imposed for that conviction, the Bureau of Prisons transferred him to a residential\n\ntreatment facility, which let him apply for weekend passes to visit family. On one such weekend,\n\nhe left to see his sister. After a day there, however, she asked him to leave and told the authorities\n\nas much. Officials directed Stafford to return to the facility.\n\n       He did not return. Two months passed before a patrol tracked him down at a fast-food\n\nrestaurant. The police positioned their cars to block him from escaping. Stafford rammed into\n\nboth cruisers for two minutes, apparently trying to move them aside so that he could drive away.\n\nWhen that did not work, he sprinted from the scene as four officers tried to tackle him, injuring\n\nthree in the process. Only after additional officers arrived did the police subdue him.\n\n       Once they handcuffed Stafford and placed him in the patrol car, the officers approached\n\nhis vehicle. A pistol lay on his driver\u2019s side floorboard. It contained nine rounds of ammunition.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v.

He pleaded guilty to both charges\n\nwithout a plea agreement. Stafford\u2019s advisory sentencing range was 37 to 46 months, and the court\n\nsentenced him to 60 months.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       Stafford challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.\n\nBecause he did not raise any procedural challenges to his sentence when given the chance, plain-\n\nerror review applies to that claim.

Stafford has not shown any obvious procedural mistake in\n\nhis sentence. To err, the district court must miscalculate the guidelines range, incorrectly deem\n\nthe guidelines mandatory, lean on clearly erroneous facts, fail to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing\n\nfactors, or fail to explain the reasons for the sentence. See United States v. Rayyan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">885 F.3d 436</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n440 (6th Cir. 2018). Nothing of the sort happened here. The district court accurately assessed the\n\nguidelines range, viewed the guidelines as advisory, relied on appropriate facts, and discussed each\n\napplicable \u00a7 3553(a) factor. On top of that, the court explained why the upward variance from the\n\nadvisory range supported deterrence, punishment, respect for the law, public protection, and\n\ncorrectional \u201cprogramming for anger management, because [Stafford] seems to not be able to\n\ncontrol himself in situations where law enforcement is in the area.\u201d R.36 at 23.\n\n       Stafford counters that the district court did not adequately explain why it imposed a 14-\n\nmonth increase over the advisory guidelines range. Yet we do not require district courts to state\n\nwhy they chose a certain sentence instead of another\u2014to the degree of granularity, say, of 60\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v.

Here, the district court gave us plenty of evidence\n\nthat it adequately considered the relevant statutory factors and had ample reasons for varying\n\nupward. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> The district court fully addressed Stafford\u2019s extensive criminal history of related\n\nescape and firearms convictions and why he deserved a five-year sentence in this instance. As the\n\ncourt explained, Stafford\u2019s instant felon-in-possession offense occurred just a short time after his\n\nprior felon-in-possession conviction. And while resisting arrest, he battled and bruised multiple\n\npolice officers, causing them to write that he \u201cendangered the lives of each one of us.\u201d R.36 at 15.\n\nHaving put officers and other members of the public at risk, the court was concerned that he would\n\ndo so again in the future. Nothing procedurally amiss, plain or otherwise, occurred.\n\n        Substantive Reasonableness. Stafford also contests the length of his sentence, claiming it\n\nis \u201ctoo long.\u201d Rayyan, 885 F.3d at 442. Weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and deciding whether to\n\naccept the advisory guidelines range in a given case turns on experience-driven judgment, not\n\nmath. See United States v. Woolridge, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">64 F.4th 757</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762\u201363 (6th Cir. 2023).

Pyles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">904 F.3d\n\n422</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (6th Cir. 2018). In this instance, the district court reasonably determined that Stafford\n\ndeserved a five-year sentence given his recidivism and the threat he posed to public safety. Beyond\n\nthe crimes incorporated into the guidelines computations, the district court contemplated his\n\nunpursued flights from police, his recalcitrance, and his pattern of resisting arrest in dangerous\n\nways.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 23-1116, United States v. Stafford\n\n\n       Stafford submits that his sentence is too long because the guidelines range already\n\naccounted for his extensive history of related crimes, making any upward variance unfair and\n\nunjustified. But he overlooks the reality that the guidelines range is advisory, which is why district\n\ncourts receive considerable discretion in the first instance in deciding whether to vary up or down\n\nfrom the proposed range.

Moises Jesus Macario-Ramirez pled guilty to\n\none count of illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and received a bottom-of-the-guidelines\n\nsentence of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.      Macario-Ramirez appeals that sentence as\n\nsubstantively unreasonable, contending that the district court improperly weighed the\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, providing too much weight to the negative aspects of\n\nMacario-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history and the need for a sentence of deterrence, while providing too\n\nlittle weight to the mitigating circumstances, such as Macario-Ramirez\u2019s impoverished upbringing\n\nand status as the sole breadwinner for his family. Because the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to Macario-Ramirez, we affirm.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       Moises Jesus Macario-Ramirez is a Guatemalan national who has been in and out of the\n\nUnited States without proper documentation for at least the past decade. Macario-Ramirez came\n\nto the United States after growing up in extreme poverty in Guatemala. At age twelve, Macario-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nRamirez began work as a field laborer to support his family. Since coming to the United States,\n\nMacario-Ramirez has held various jobs to support his wife and young daughter in Indiana as well\n\nas his family back in Guatemala.\n\n       Since his initial entry, Macario-Ramirez has also garnered repeated interactions with law\n\nenforcement. Authorities first apprehended Macario-Ramirez at nineteen years-old in 2010 after\n\nwitnessing him driving erratically. Macario-Ramirez failed a sobriety test on the scene and\n\nadmitted to being intoxicated. He then pled guilty to reckless driving and driving without a license.\n\nThe next year, Macario-Ramirez was again arrested after handing police forged identification\n\npapers during a traffic stop\u2014resulting in two felony charges. Macario-Ramirez skipped the\n\npreliminary hearing in connection with these offenses and was subsequently charged with bail\n\njumping. After pleading guilty to each charge, Macario-Ramirez served two years in prison and\n\nwas deported to Guatemala in 2015.1\n\n       Macario-Ramirez returned to the United States soon after and continued to accumulate\n\ntraffic and substance-related charges. In 2018, for example, Macario-Ramirez pled guilty to\n\ndriving without a license after police responded to an accident. And in 2020, Macario-Ramirez\n\nwas arrested for public intoxication at a fashion mall. After the arrest, law enforcement discovered\n\nthat Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) had placed a hold on Macario-Ramirez and\n\nlater transported him to ICE custody, from which he was deported from the United States for a\n\nsecond time.\n\n       Not long after, Macario-Ramirez again crossed into the United States and was deported for\n\nthe third time in 2021 after serving six months\u2019 imprisonment for an illegal reentry charge in\n\n\n1\n  Prior to his first deportation, Macario-Ramirez had also been arrested for other driving and\nintoxication-related offenses under other names. Some of these charges were later dismissed, but\nthe dispositions of others are unclear from the record.\n                                                -2-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nArizona. This charge also subjected Macario-Ramirez to a thirty-six-month term of supervised\n\nrelease, which prohibited Macario-Ramirez from committing another federal, state, or local crime,\n\nand from entering the United States without legal authorization.\n\n       Undeterred, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States again sometime in 2022 and was\n\napprehended for the current offense. He encountered customs officers in Port Huron, Michigan\n\nafter being denied entry into Canada. During this encounter, Macario-Ramirez admitted to being\n\nin the United States illegally. Macario-Ramirez subsequently pled guilty to unlawful reentry under\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). At the same time, Macario-Ramirez pled guilty to violating two conditions of\n\nhis supervised release established from his previous illegal reentry conviction.2 The district court\n\nsentenced Macario-Ramirez to six months on the supervised release violation to run concurrent\n\nwith his pending illegal reentry sentence.\n\n       At sentencing, both parties agreed that the applicable Guidelines range for Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s illegal reentry conviction was thirty-seven to forty-six months. The parties diverged,\n\nhowever, on the appropriate sentence. The government requested that the court sentence at the top\n\nof the range with a forty-six-month sentence, while Macario-Ramirez requested that the court\n\nsentence him to time-served, or, alternatively, to nine months. After ensuring that neither party\n\nhad objections to the information within the presentence report, the district court allowed the\n\ngovernment, defense, and then Macario-Ramirez himself, to speak. Macario-Ramirez expressed\n\nregret for his previous infractions and resolved to \u201cdo things in the right way\u201d going forward. DE\n\n25, Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 126.\n\n\n\n\n2\n Jurisdiction over the supervised release violations garnered by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s new federal\noffense was transferred from the District of Arizona to the Eastern District of Michigan.\n                                               -3-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\n       After the allocution, the district court conveyed its understanding of the case. The district\n\ncourt began with Macario-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history. The district court highlighted Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s repeated interactions with law enforcement in the United States, noting that he often\n\ncame into contact with immigration authorities \u201cbecause of some illegal act [Macario-Ramirez]\n\ndid.\u201d Id. While these acts were not major, they did put others at risk. Specifically, the district\n\ncourt emphasized the dangers presented by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of drunk driving, stating\n\nthat it put \u201ccitizens at risk, other drivers at risk, [and] police officers at risk.\u201d Id. This criminal\n\nhistory and Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of reentry, the court reasoned, rendered a sentence of time-\n\nserved inappropriate.\n\n       Next, the district court acknowledged Macario-Ramirez\u2019s difficult upbringing in\n\nGuatemala. The court described the poverty Macario-Ramirez faced as \u201chorrible,\u201d and recognized\n\nthat Macario-Ramirez \u201ctried to help [his wife and daughter] out as much as [he] could.\u201d Id. at\n\nPage ID 127\u201328. But the district court deemed these circumstances not to excuse repeated\n\nviolations of the law. The district court highlighted that that Macario-Ramirez\u2019s upbringing was\n\n\u201csimilar to lots of people that have come over.\u201d Id. at Page ID 127. Furthermore, the court\n\nreminded Macario-Ramirez that he had been given light sentences for his previous convictions,\n\nand that his repeated reentry demonstrated that such sentences had neither instilled in Macario-\n\nRamirez respect for the law nor provided adequate deterrence.\n\n       After explicitly citing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Macario-Ramirez\n\nto thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment to run concurrently with the six-month sentence for the\n\nsupervised release violation, which the district court described as \u201ca break.\u201d Id. at Page ID 130,\n\n133. That sentence would be followed by two years of supervised release, which the district court\n\nwarned Macario-Ramirez meant that he could not return to the United States without authorization\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v.

We\n\nreview sentencing decisions \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d Gall v. United\n\nStates, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007). On appellate review, within-guidelines sentences also enjoy a\n\npresumption of reasonableness. United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 389 (6th Cir. 2008) (en\n\nbanc). Nonetheless, a \u201csentence may be substantively unreasonable if the district court chooses\n\nthe sentence arbitrarily, grounds the sentence on impermissible factors, or unreasonably weighs a\n\npertinent factor.\u201d United States v. Adkins, 729 F.3d 559, 563\u201364 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Brooks, 628 F.3d 791, 796 (6th Cir. 2011)). The reviewing court\u2019s role is to examine\n\n\u201cwhether the sentence is reasonable,\u201d not whether we would have imposed the same sentence in\n\nthe first instance. Id. at 571 (quoting United States v. Ely, 468 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2006)).\n\n                                                III.\n\n       Macario-Ramirez primarily contends that the district court abused its discretion by putting\n\ntoo much weight on some factors, like the need for his sentence to instill respect for the law and\n\nprovide adequate deterrence, and not enough on others, such as the nonviolent nature of his\n\ncriminal history as well as his troubled upbringing and strong family ties. First, Macario-Ramirez\n\ncontends that the Guidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months, while calculated correctly,\n\noverstates the seriousness of the instant offense, and thus the district court erred by giving\n\n\u201cunreasonably high negative weight to the [G]uidelines.\u201d Appellant Br., at 11\u201312. Indeed, other\n\ncourts have acknowledged that old convictions may drive up the Guidelines range in a manner that\n\nmakes the range inappropriately high under the circumstances. See United States v. Amezcua-\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nVasquez, 567 F.3d 1050, 1055\u201356 (9th Cir. 2009) (deeming enhancement based on an over twenty-\n\nyear-old conviction for crime of violence unreasonable under the circumstances where defendant\n\ndid not commit any like crimes thereafter); cf. United States v. Calderon-Minchola, 351 F. App\u2019x\n\n610, 611\u201312 (3d Cir. 2009) (deeming seventeen-month below-Guidelines sentence unreasonable\n\nbased on the record in part because criminal history relied on unrelated, minor crime committed\n\nyears prior). Macario-Ramirez argues that this is such a case because his Guidelines range was\n\ndriven up by his nearly decade-old forged instrument convictions. Given this circumstance,\n\nMacario-Ramirez argues that even a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range is \u201cgreater than\n\nnecessary\u201d to achieve the sentencing goals articulated in \u00a7 3553(a). United States v. Tristan-\n\nMadrigal, 601 F.3d 629, 632\u201333 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).\n\n       Here, however, Macario-Ramirez\u2019s Guidelines range was not unreasonably high because\n\nMacario-Ramirez\u2019s convictions for possession of forged identification documents, although\n\nsomewhat old, related to Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of residence in the United States without\n\nproper documentation. Thus, the offenses were not \u201cunrepresentative of [Macario Ramirez\u2019s]\n\ncharacteristics during the past many years;\u201d rather, they comported with the conduct resulting in\n\nthe illegal reentry offense at issue. Cf. Amezcua-Vasquez, 567 F.3d at 1056 (predicate convictions\n\n\u201cwere very old and unrepresentative\u201d of the defendant\u2019s characteristics in the decades since);\n\nCalderon-Minchola, 351 F. App\u2019x at 612 (criminal history relied on by district court entailed\n\ndecades-old count for theft of sunglasses valued at less than $20).\n\n       Similarly, the district court did not give the Guidelines unreasonable weight in fashioning\n\nMacario-Ramirez\u2019s sentence. Rather, the district court thoroughly reviewed Macario-Ramirez\u2019s\n\nhistory and characteristics, specifically his criminal history and the circumstances of his\n\nupbringing and family situation, among other things, in coming to an appropriate sentence. The\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\ndistrict court specifically recognized that Macario-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history did not reflect the\n\ncommission of \u201cmajor\u201d crimes. DE 25, Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 126. Nonetheless, the\n\ndistrict court did not act unreasonably in determining that Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of alcohol-\n\nand driving-related offenses created a danger to the public. See Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d at\n\n633\u201334 (deeming sentencing judge\u2019s emphasis on the dangerousness presented by a history of\n\ndrunk driving reasonable even though the past offenses did not actually result in injuries to others);\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (citing the need \u201cto protect the public\u201d).\n\n       Additionally, the court addressed Macario-Ramirez\u2019s recidivism with respect to the crime\n\nat issue\u2014unlawful reentry. Although Macario-Ramirez expressed his resolve to comply with the\n\nlaw in the future, the court highlighted its concerns that previous sentences and deportations had\n\nnot sufficiently deterred Macario-Ramirez from reentering the United States without proper\n\ndocumentation. These concerns are far from unfounded and are not ameliorated by Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s prospect of deportation after this sentence since he has thrice returned to the United\n\nStates after deportation. See Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d at 634\u201335 (upward departure to thirty-\n\nsix months\u2019 imprisonment reasonable in part because defendant\u2019s history of four unauthorized\n\nreentries over an eight-year period supported the district court\u2019s \u201cconcern that [the defendant]\n\nwould likely reoffend if not incarcerated for a time period greater than the top of the recommended\n\nGuidelines range\u201d).\n\n       For similar reasons, we reject Macario-Ramirez\u2019s argument that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in ascribing too little weight to Macario-Ramirez\u2019s upbringing, strong family ties,\n\nand role as the primary financial provider for his family. The record demonstrates that the district\n\ncourt did adequately consider relevant mitigating factors. The district court acknowledged that it\n\nread and \u201cappreciate[d]\u201d the letter written by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s wife, that it recognized the\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nchallenges wrought by his upbringing in Guatemala, and that it understood that Macario-Ramirez\n\nhad a wife and young daughter whom he loved and for whom he provided financially. DE 25,\n\nSentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 121, 127\u201330. The district court did not act unreasonably, however,\n\nin determining that the need for deterrence and respect for the law evinced by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s\n\ncriminal history and repeated reentry outweighed the mitigating aspects of his history and\n\ncircumstances. See United States v. Sanchez-Mercado, 409 F. App\u2019x 879, 882 (6th Cir. 2011)\n\n(rejecting substantive reasonableness challenge to thirty-seven-month sentence in unlawful reentry\n\ncase for defendant with record of previous removal and substance-related convictions based on\n\ndistrict court\u2019s alleged failure to give sufficient weight to defendant\u2019s family situation and\n\nemployment record); Adkins, 729 F.3d at 571\u201372 (no substantive unreasonableness where district\n\ncourt adequately considered defendant\u2019s family circumstances).\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       Given this analysis, Macario-Ramirez\u2019s arguments are \u201cinsufficient to justify our\n\ndisturbing the reasoned judgment of the district court.\u201d United States v.

Macario-Ramirez appeals that sentence as\n\nsubstantively unreasonable, contending that the district court improperly weighed the\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a) sentencing factors, providing too much weight to the negative aspects of\n\nMacario-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history and the need for a sentence of deterrence, while providing too\n\nlittle weight to the mitigating circumstances, such as Macario-Ramirez\u2019s impoverished upbringing\n\nand status as the sole breadwinner for his family. Because the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to Macario-Ramirez, we affirm.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       Moises Jesus Macario-Ramirez is a Guatemalan national who has been in and out of the\n\nUnited States without proper documentation for at least the past decade. Macario-Ramirez came\n\nto the United States after growing up in extreme poverty in Guatemala. At age twelve, Macario-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nRamirez began work as a field laborer to support his family. Since coming to the United States,\n\nMacario-Ramirez has held various jobs to support his wife and young daughter in Indiana as well\n\nas his family back in Guatemala.\n\n       Since his initial entry, Macario-Ramirez has also garnered repeated interactions with law\n\nenforcement. Authorities first apprehended Macario-Ramirez at nineteen years-old in 2010 after\n\nwitnessing him driving erratically. Macario-Ramirez failed a sobriety test on the scene and\n\nadmitted to being intoxicated. He then pled guilty to reckless driving and driving without a license.\n\nThe next year, Macario-Ramirez was again arrested after handing police forged identification\n\npapers during a traffic stop\u2014resulting in two felony charges. Macario-Ramirez skipped the\n\npreliminary hearing in connection with these offenses and was subsequently charged with bail\n\njumping. After pleading guilty to each charge, Macario-Ramirez served two years in prison and\n\nwas deported to Guatemala in 2015.1\n\n       Macario-Ramirez returned to the United States soon after and continued to accumulate\n\ntraffic and substance-related charges. In 2018, for example, Macario-Ramirez pled guilty to\n\ndriving without a license after police responded to an accident. And in 2020, Macario-Ramirez\n\nwas arrested for public intoxication at a fashion mall. After the arrest, law enforcement discovered\n\nthat Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) had placed a hold on Macario-Ramirez and\n\nlater transported him to ICE custody, from which he was deported from the United States for a\n\nsecond time.\n\n       Not long after, Macario-Ramirez again crossed into the United States and was deported for\n\nthe third time in 2021 after serving six months\u2019 imprisonment for an illegal reentry charge in\n\n\n1\n  Prior to his first deportation, Macario-Ramirez had also been arrested for other driving and\nintoxication-related offenses under other names. Some of these charges were later dismissed, but\nthe dispositions of others are unclear from the record.\n                                                -2-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nArizona. This charge also subjected Macario-Ramirez to a thirty-six-month term of supervised\n\nrelease, which prohibited Macario-Ramirez from committing another federal, state, or local crime,\n\nand from entering the United States without legal authorization.\n\n       Undeterred, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States again sometime in 2022 and was\n\napprehended for the current offense. He encountered customs officers in Port Huron, Michigan\n\nafter being denied entry into Canada. During this encounter, Macario-Ramirez admitted to being\n\nin the United States illegally. Macario-Ramirez subsequently pled guilty to unlawful reentry under\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a). At the same time, Macario-Ramirez pled guilty to violating two conditions of\n\nhis supervised release established from his previous illegal reentry conviction.2 The district court\n\nsentenced Macario-Ramirez to six months on the supervised release violation to run concurrent\n\nwith his pending illegal reentry sentence.\n\n       At sentencing, both parties agreed that the applicable Guidelines range for Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s illegal reentry conviction was thirty-seven to forty-six months. The parties diverged,\n\nhowever, on the appropriate sentence. The government requested that the court sentence at the top\n\nof the range with a forty-six-month sentence, while Macario-Ramirez requested that the court\n\nsentence him to time-served, or, alternatively, to nine months. After ensuring that neither party\n\nhad objections to the information within the presentence report, the district court allowed the\n\ngovernment, defense, and then Macario-Ramirez himself, to speak. Macario-Ramirez expressed\n\nregret for his previous infractions and resolved to \u201cdo things in the right way\u201d going forward. DE\n\n25, Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 126.\n\n\n\n\n2\n Jurisdiction over the supervised release violations garnered by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s new federal\noffense was transferred from the District of Arizona to the Eastern District of Michigan.\n                                               -3-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\n       After the allocution, the district court conveyed its understanding of the case. The district\n\ncourt began with Macario-Ramirez\u2019s criminal history. The district court highlighted Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s repeated interactions with law enforcement in the United States, noting that he often\n\ncame into contact with immigration authorities \u201cbecause of some illegal act [Macario-Ramirez]\n\ndid.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> While these acts were not major, they did put others at risk. Specifically, the district\n\ncourt emphasized the dangers presented by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of drunk driving, stating\n\nthat it put \u201ccitizens at risk, other drivers at risk, [and] police officers at risk.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> This criminal\n\nhistory and Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of reentry, the court reasoned, rendered a sentence of time-\n\nserved inappropriate.\n\n       Next, the district court acknowledged Macario-Ramirez\u2019s difficult upbringing in\n\nGuatemala. The court described the poverty Macario-Ramirez faced as \u201chorrible,\u201d and recognized\n\nthat Macario-Ramirez \u201ctried to help [his wife and daughter] out as much as [he] could.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n\nPage ID 127\u201328. But the district court deemed these circumstances not to excuse repeated\n\nviolations of the law. The district court highlighted that that Macario-Ramirez\u2019s upbringing was\n\n\u201csimilar to lots of people that have come over.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at Page ID 127. Furthermore, the court\n\nreminded Macario-Ramirez that he had been given light sentences for his previous convictions,\n\nand that his repeated reentry demonstrated that such sentences had neither instilled in Macario-\n\nRamirez respect for the law nor provided adequate deterrence.\n\n       After explicitly citing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Macario-Ramirez\n\nto thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment to run concurrently with the six-month sentence for the\n\nsupervised release violation, which the district court described as \u201ca break.\u201d Id. at Page ID 130,\n\n133. That sentence would be followed by two years of supervised release, which the district court\n\nwarned Macario-Ramirez meant that he could not return to the United States without authorization\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v.

Thus, the offenses were not \u201cunrepresentative of [Macario Ramirez\u2019s]\n\ncharacteristics during the past many years;\u201d rather, they comported with the conduct resulting in\n\nthe illegal reentry offense at issue.

Rather, the district court thoroughly reviewed Macario-Ramirez\u2019s\n\nhistory and characteristics, specifically his criminal history and the circumstances of his\n\nupbringing and family situation, among other things, in coming to an appropriate sentence. The\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v.

DE 25, Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 126. Nonetheless, the\n\ndistrict court did not act unreasonably in determining that Macario-Ramirez\u2019s history of alcohol-\n\nand driving-related offenses created a danger to the public. See Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d at\n\n633\u201334 (deeming sentencing judge\u2019s emphasis on the dangerousness presented by a history of\n\ndrunk driving reasonable even though the past offenses did not actually result in injuries to others);\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(2)(C) (citing the need \u201cto protect the public\u201d).\n\n       Additionally, the court addressed Macario-Ramirez\u2019s recidivism with respect to the crime\n\nat issue\u2014unlawful reentry. Although Macario-Ramirez expressed his resolve to comply with the\n\nlaw in the future, the court highlighted its concerns that previous sentences and deportations had\n\nnot sufficiently deterred Macario-Ramirez from reentering the United States without proper\n\ndocumentation. These concerns are far from unfounded and are not ameliorated by Macario-\n\nRamirez\u2019s prospect of deportation after this sentence since he has thrice returned to the United\n\nStates after deportation. See Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d at 634\u201335 (upward departure to thirty-\n\nsix months\u2019 imprisonment reasonable in part because defendant\u2019s history of four unauthorized\n\nreentries over an eight-year period supported the district court\u2019s \u201cconcern that [the defendant]\n\nwould likely reoffend if not incarcerated for a time period greater than the top of the recommended\n\nGuidelines range\u201d).\n\n       For similar reasons, we reject Macario-Ramirez\u2019s argument that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in ascribing too little weight to Macario-Ramirez\u2019s upbringing, strong family ties,\n\nand role as the primary financial provider for his family. The record demonstrates that the district\n\ncourt did adequately consider relevant mitigating factors. The district court acknowledged that it\n\nread and \u201cappreciate[d]\u201d the letter written by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s wife, that it recognized the\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNos. 23-1180/1183, United States v. Macario-Ramirez\n\n\nchallenges wrought by his upbringing in Guatemala, and that it understood that Macario-Ramirez\n\nhad a wife and young daughter whom he loved and for whom he provided financially. DE 25,\n\nSentencing Hr\u2019g Tr., Page ID 121, 127\u201330. The district court did not act unreasonably, however,\n\nin determining that the need for deterrence and respect for the law evinced by Macario-Ramirez\u2019s\n\ncriminal history and repeated reentry outweighed the mitigating aspects of his history and\n\ncircumstances.

Moreover, Plaintiffs explicitly disclaimed\n\n        reliance on the buyer\u2019s identity in the purchase agreement. We therefore conclude that the\n\n        district court properly found that Plaintiffs failed to allege a claim for fraud.\n\n               We likewise conclude that the district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of\n\n        civil and statutory conspiracy.     Under Virginia law, \u201cactions for common law civil\n\n        conspiracy and statutory business conspiracy lie only if a plaintiff sustains damages as a\n\n        result of an act that is itself wrongful or tortious.\u201d Dunlap v.

The question in this case is whether and to what\n\n        extent money owed under a pre-suit settlement agreement arising from such injury falls\n\n        within the scope of \u00a7 523(a)(6). We agree with the district court that the debts at issue here\n\n        are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                                                     A.\n\n               To give debtors a \u201cfresh start,\u201d the Bankruptcy Code starts from a \u201cpresumption of\n\n        dischargeability.\u201d In re Strack, 524 F.3d 493, 496\u201397 (4th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\n\n        marks omitted). Under that presumption, \u201c\u2018all legal obligations of the debtor, no matter\n\n        how remote or contingent\u2019 are potentially dischargeable in bankruptcy.\u201d Id. at 497 (quoting\n\n        H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 309 (1977)).\n\n               But there are exceptions to the general rule of dischargeability, set out by Congress\n\n        in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). Id.; see Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 138 S. Ct. 1752,\n\n        1758 (2018). This case turns on one such exception, barring the discharge of \u201cany debt . . .\n\n        for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another\n\n        entity.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). It is no longer disputed that the debtor here caused \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of that exception. Instead, the parties spar over\n\n        two questions: whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation over a \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d creates a non-dischargeable \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury; and, if so, whether\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762        Doc: 36        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 4 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable\n\n        under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               In 2010, Lee Andrew Hilgartner physically assaulted Yasuko Yagi in two separate\n\n        incidents. After the assaults, the parties entered into two agreements obligating Hilgartner\n\n        to compensate Yagi for the harm he caused her. The first, not directly at issue here,\n\n        describes the assaults, with Hilgartner admitting to \u201cgrab[bing]\u201d Yagi \u201cby the hair,\u201d\n\n        \u201chit[ting] her head and shoulders\u201d into a car door, and \u201cgrab[bing] both of her arms\n\n        forcefully, resulting in bruising on her arms and hands.\u201d J.A. 131. That agreement required\n\n        Hilgartner to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments.\n\n               Yagi did not release her claims, however, and years later she and Hilgartner entered\n\n        into the settlement agreement that gives rise to this case. The agreement reiterates\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s \u201cfactual and legal responsibility\u201d for \u201chis infliction of . . . Yagi\u2019s injuries.\u201d\n\n        J.A. 70. It then explains that in order \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation,\u201d id.,\n\n        Hilgartner will pay Yagi $415,000 (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) in installments, as well as fifteen\n\n        percent interest on untimely payments. The agreement also grants reasonable attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees to the prevailing party in any action commenced to enforce or interpret the settlement.\n\n               Though Hilgartner paid a chunk of his obligation \u2013 totaling $185,955 over some\n\n        years \u2013 he did not keep up. Instead, he stopped paying, and in 2019, Yagi sued to enforce\n\n        the settlement agreement. See Yagi v. Hilgartner, No. 1:19-cv-01305-RDA-TCB (E.D.\n\n        Va.). Two days before a scheduled hearing on Yagi\u2019s motion for default judgment,\n\n        Hilgartner filed for bankruptcy, thereby staying Yagi\u2019s enforcement action. Yagi filed a\n\n                                                      4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762       Doc: 36        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 5 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        proof of claim with the bankruptcy court and objected to Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy plan on\n\n        the ground that the debt he owed her was non-dischargeable as a debt for willful and\n\n        malicious injury.\n\n               Yagi then filed the action from which this appeal arises: a complaint to determine\n\n        the dischargeability of Hilgartner\u2019s debt to her. She sought a declaration that the full\n\n        amount Hilgartner owed her under the settlement agreement \u2013 including, as relevant here,\n\n        not only unpaid principal but also interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in\n\n        enforcing the settlement \u2013 was non-dischargeable because the agreement \u201cintended to\n\n        compensate [her] for the injuries she sustained from [Hilgartner\u2019s] intentional and\n\n        malicious actions.\u201d J.A. 68\u201369.\n\n                                                    C.\n\n               In the bankruptcy court, Hilgartner vigorously disputed whether he had inflicted\n\n        \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6) by assaulting Yagi. The\n\n        bankruptcy court concluded that he had, crediting Yagi\u2019s testimony and Hilgartner\u2019s\n\n        \u201cwritten acknowledgements of the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d J.A. 140\u201341. As a result,\n\n        it held the unpaid $229,045 of the principal \u2013 the $415,000 the agreement demanded less\n\n        the $185,955 Hilgartner had already paid \u2013 non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). J.A. 141.\n\n               But the bankruptcy court reached a different conclusion regarding other debts due\n\n        under the settlement agreement, which we refer to together here as \u201ccollection debts\u201d: the\n\n        fifteen percent interest accrued on Hilgartner\u2019s tardy payments and the attorney\u2019s fees Yagi\n\n        incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement. J.A. 142. In analyzing those amounts,\n\n        the bankruptcy court recognized that all debts \u201carising from\u201d willful and malicious injury\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762       Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 6 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        are covered by \u00a7 523(a)(6) and hence non-dischargeable. J.A. 142 (citing Cohen v. de la\n\n        Cruz, 523 U.S. 213, 223 (1998)). But, the court reasoned, the collection debts \u2013 unlike the\n\n        principal debt \u2013 \u201cd[id] not flow directly from the injuries sustained\u201d but instead \u201ccame into\n\n        being years later when the parties signed the Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344. That\n\n        separation between injury and liability, it believed, took the collection debts outside the\n\n        terms of \u00a7 523(a)(6) and made them dischargeable. J.A. 144.\n\n               On appeal to the district court, Hilgartner argued that the bankruptcy court erred in\n\n        finding any part of his debt non-dischargeable. According to Hilgartner, neither the\n\n        principal debt nor the collection debt came within the \u00a7 523(a)(6) exception, because both\n\n        arose from a settlement agreement rather than a judgment.              It followed, Hilgartner\n\n        contended, that his entire debt was \u201cfor\u201d a breach of contract \u2013 and thus dischargeable in\n\n        bankruptcy \u2013 rather than \u201cfor\u201d a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n               The district court disagreed on both counts, affirming in part and reversing in part\n\n        the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Hilgartner v. Yagi, 643 B.R. 107, 127 (E.D. Va. 2022).\n\n        The district court first addressed the dischargeability of the outstanding principal amount\n\n        of $229,045. Here, it agreed with the bankruptcy court, rejecting Hilgartner\u2019s contention\n\n        that the settlement agreement had \u201cconvert[ed]\u201d a non-dischargeable \u201ctort claim\u201d into a\n\n        dischargeable \u201ccontract claim.\u201d Id. at 117. Like the bankruptcy court, the district court\n\n        concluded that Supreme Court precedent \u201csquarely resolved\u201d this issue in Yagi\u2019s favor: In\n\n        Archer v. Warner, 538 U.S. 314 (2003), \u201cthe Court held that . . . money promised in a\n\n        settlement contract arising out of [a] tort . . . retain[s] the character of the underlying tort\u201d\n\n        for dischargeability purposes.

Id. (quoting Brown v. Felsen, 442\n\n        U.S. 127, 138 (1979)). Because the settlement agreement here arose out of a willful and\n\n        malicious injury, it created a non-dischargeable debt. Id. at 119. 1\n\n               But the district court departed from the bankruptcy court as to the collection debts.\n\n        The district court saw no reason to disaggregate, for purposes of dischargeability under\n\n        \u00a7 523(a)(6), \u201ca settlement award flowing from tortious conduct\u201d and \u201cancillary costs meant\n\n        to enforce and collect on\u201d that settlement award. Id. at 125. Both debts \u201caris[e]\u201d from the\n\n        same willful and malicious injury, the court reasoned, so both debts are non-dischargeable.\n\n        Id. at 123\u201326 (quoting Cohen, 523 U.S. at 218).\n\n               Hilgartner timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               On appeal, Hilgartner presses the same arguments as before the district court. His\n\n        opening position is that both his principal debt and his collection debt are dischargeable\n\n        because both are routine debts for breach of contract \u2013 the settlement agreement \u2013 rather\n\n        than debts for the underlying willful and malicious injury. But even if the principal amount\n\n        owed under the settlement agreement is non-dischargeable, he continues, the bankruptcy\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                 Although Hilgartner did not appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that he\n        had inflicted a \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(6), the district court\n        performed a de novo review of that conclusion and agreed. Id. Hilgartner again declines\n        to challenge that holding before us, so we consider it resolved.\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 8 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        court had it right: The collection debt is one step further removed from the original tort\n\n        and thus falls outside the scope of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n               \u201cWhen considering an appeal from a district court acting in its capacity as a\n\n        bankruptcy appellate court,\u201d we conduct \u201can independent review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s\n\n        decision, reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.\u201d\n\n        SummitBridge Nat\u2019l Invs. III, LLC v.

Hilgartner does not appeal any factual determinations as clearly erroneous, nor\n\n        does he challenge the conclusion that he inflicted willful and malicious injury within the\n\n        meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6). Instead, this appeal turns primarily on one legal question: whether\n\n        the Bankruptcy Code permits Hilgartner to discharge his debt to Yagi. 2\n\n                                                     A.\n\n               A \u201cdebt\u201d falls within \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u2019s exception from discharge if it is \u201cfor willful and\n\n        malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\u201d 11\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). In this case, the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d is now a given; the issue\n\n        is whether amounts due under the parties\u2019 settlement agreement are \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury.\n\n        And on that question, the Supreme Court has provided important guidance, instructing that\n\n        the introductory phrase \u201cdebt for\u201d \u2013 which prefaces most of \u00a7 523(a)\u2019s exceptions to\n\n\n               2\n                  Hilgartner also challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s calculation of the principal\n        amount due under the settlement and its allowance of interest accrued prior to the filing of\n        his petition. The bankruptcy and district courts both rejected Hilgartner\u2019s arguments on\n        these fronts, see J.A. 142 n.6, 145; Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 120\u201321, 126, and we find no\n        error in their holdings.\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 9 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        discharge \u2013 \u201cconnot[es] broadly any liability arising from the specified\u201d conduct.

Indeed, like those courts, we consider the issue squarely\n\n        resolved by Supreme Court precedent.\n\n               In Archer v. Warner, 538 U.S. 314 (2003), the Supreme Court rejected an argument\n\n        nearly identical to Hilgartner\u2019s. That case involved a debt under an agreement settling a\n\n        lawsuit for fraud. And while a debt for money obtained by fraud is excepted from\n\n        discharge, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), the debtor argued \u2013 like Hilgartner here \u2013 that his\n\n        debt was dischargeable, because it was for breach of the settlement agreement rather than\n\n        for the underlying fraud. His settlement agreement, in other words, had \u201creplaced\u201d his\n\n        non-dischargeable debt for fraud with a dischargeable debt for breach of contract. Archer,\n\n        538 U.S. at 318. The Supreme Court disagreed. The Bankruptcy Code, it explained,\n\n        required it to \u201clook behind\u201d the settlement \u201cto determine whether it reflected settlement of\u201d\n\n        an otherwise non-dischargeable claim. Id. at 320. If it did, then the settlement debt was\n\n        also non-dischargeable, even though collection on that debt sounded in contract rather than\n\n        tort. Id. at 320\u201321.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762        Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024          Pg: 10 of 18\n\n\n\n\n                 Archer understood itself to be \u201cgovern[ed]\u201d by Brown v. Felsen, 442 U.S. 127\n\n        (1979). Archer, 538 U.S. at 319. Brown involved similar circumstances but featured a\n\n        consent decree rather than an out-of-court settlement. Archer, 538 U.S. at 319\u201321. That\n\n        made no difference, the Archer Court concluded: \u201cA debt embodied in the settlement of a\n\n        fraud case \u2018arises\u2019 no less \u2018out of\u2019 the underlying fraud than a debt embodied in a stipulation\n\n        and consent decree.\u201d Id. at 321.\n\n                 As Brown governed Archer, so Archer governs here:                      Hilgartner\u2019s non-\n\n        dischargeable debt for \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d may have been reduced to a\n\n        settlement agreement, but that does not \u201cchange[] the nature of the debt for dischargeability\n\n        purposes.\u201d Id. at 320.\n\n                 Hilgartner gestures at two distinctions from Archer, but neither makes a difference.\n\n        First, Archer, as noted above, concerned a different subsection of \u00a7 523(a), excepting from\n\n        discharge \u201cany debt . . . for money . . . to the extent obtained by . . . actual fraud.\u201d 11\n\n        U.S.C.     \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).      But    as   the        Supreme    Court   explained   in   Cohen,\n\n        the phrase \u201cto the extent obtained by\u201d does not speak to whether a particular debt is\n\n        traceable to or arises from fraud for purposes of dischargeability. 523 U.S. at 218. Instead,\n\n        that inquiry is governed by the introductory words \u201cdebt for,\u201d id. at 219\u201320 \u2013 precisely the\n\n        same words that introduce \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u2019s \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d exception, subject\n\n        to the same broad reading. See id. at 220 (\u201cBecause each use of \u2018debt for\u2019 in \u00a7 523(a)\n\n        serves the identical function of introducing a category of nondischargeable debt, the\n\n        presumption that equivalent words have equivalent meaning when repeated in the same\n\n        statute has particular resonance here.\u201d (internal citation omitted)). There is thus no textual\n\n                                                          10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762        Doc: 36       Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 11 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        basis for limiting Archer to the specific subsection under which it was decided. See In re\n\n        Detrano, 326 F.3d 319, 322 (2d Cir. 2003) (explaining that case arising under different\n\n        \u00a7 523(a) exception to discharge is \u201cnonetheless control[led]\u201d by Archer).\n\n               Second, Hilgartner notes that the settlement agreement in Archer resolved an\n\n        existing lawsuit, while this settlement agreement preempted a lawsuit. See J.A. 70 (stating\n\n        that parties are entering agreement \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation\u201d). Again,\n\n        the statutory question is whether debt embodied in a settlement agreement is \u201cdebt for\u201d the\n\n        underlying tort claim, and whether the agreement comes before or after litigation has no\n\n        obvious bearing on that point. Indeed, the Supreme Court rejected just this sort of\n\n        technicality in Archer: There was no reason, the Court explained, why it would matter that\n\n        the debt at issue in Brown was reduced to a consent judgment while the debt at issue in\n\n        Archer was embodied in a settlement agreement; both debts arose out of fraud. Archer,\n\n        538 U.S. at 321. By the same token, here, a debt embodied in a pre-suit settlement that\n\n        resolves a claim for willful and malicious injury \u201c\u2018arises\u2019 no less \u2018out of\u2019 the underlying\n\n        [tort] than a debt embodied\u201d in a post-suit settlement. Id. What matters is the \u201ctrue nature\u201d\n\n        of the debt, id. (quoting Brown, 442 U.S. at 138), not the form of the legal instrument in\n\n        which it is reflected. 3\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  While courts rarely note any distinction between pre- and post-suit settlements in\n        this context, it appears that they generally apply Archer to debts arising from both. See,\n        e.g., In re Hathaway, 364 B.R. 220, 241\u201343 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2007) (applying Archer to\n        pre-suit settlement).\n\n                                                     11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 12 of 18\n\n\n\n\n               Cases may arise where the absence of an underlying lawsuit makes it more difficult,\n\n        as a practical matter, for the creditor to demonstrate that a debt embodied in an agreement\n\n        is \u201cfor\u201d willful or malicious injury or some other non-dischargeable claim. See In re Muhs,\n\n        923 F.3d 377, 384 (4th Cir. 2019) (creditor bears burden of proving non-dischargeability\n\n        by preponderance of the evidence). This is not such a case. The settlement agreement\n\n        itself answers any questions on that front: The debt is \u201cfor the pain, damage, and suffering\u201d\n\n        Hilgartner caused Yagi in \u201caltercation[s]\u201d on two dates in 2010. J.A. 70. Because \u2013 as all\n\n        now agree \u2013 those altercations inflicted \u201cwillful and malicious injury,\u201d Hilgartner cannot\n\n        discharge the debts arising therefrom.\n\n                                                     2.\n\n               We turn now to the issue that divided the bankruptcy court and district court: the\n\n        dischargeability of what we are calling the \u201ccollection debts.\u201d These are liabilities arising\n\n        from the terms of the settlement agreement and triggered by Yagi\u2019s efforts to collect on\n\n        that agreement: interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in enforcing the\n\n        agreement and contesting Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. We conclude that, like the\n\n        principal, these debts \u201caris[e] from\u201d willful and malicious injury, Cohen, 523 U.S. at 223,\n\n        and are therefore likewise non-dischargeable.\n\n               An initial clarification: The attorney\u2019s fees incurred in executing the settlement\n\n        agreement \u2013 as opposed to collecting on it \u2013 are not in controversy. Those fees are not\n\n        dischargeable for two reasons. Most straightforwardly, the settlement agreement explicitly\n\n        absorbed the fees into the principal, J.A. 70\u201371, which, as explained above, is not\n\n        dischargeable. And in any event, Cohen establishes that attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762       Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 13 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        creation of a non-dischargeable debt are also non-dischargeable, as part of the \u201cfull liability\n\n        traceable\u201d to the underlying injury. Cohen, 523 U.S. at 219.\n\n               What is disputed here are the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in collecting on the settlement\n\n        agreement and contesting Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy court, as\n\n        noted above, held these debts dischargeable because, in its view, they arose not \u201cdirectly\u201d\n\n        from the assaults but rather \u201ccame into being years later when the parties signed the\n\n        Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344. And the same was true, it held, with respect to the\n\n        interest that accumulated when Hilgartner paid his installments late.\n\n               Like the district court, we disagree. And like the district court, we think the Supreme\n\n        Court\u2019s decision in Cohen points toward the opposite result. In Cohen, the Court held that\n\n        treble damages from \u201cactual fraud\u201d \u2013 and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigating the fraud \u2013\n\n        are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)\u2019s exception for \u201cdebt for\u201d money obtained\n\n        through such fraud. See 523 U.S. at 215; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). That case establishes\n\n        two propositions important to this case.\n\n               First, Cohen forecloses any argument that only the portion of Hilgartner\u2019s debt\n\n        commensurate with the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d he inflicted \u2013 the \u201crestitutionary\u201d\n\n        portion \u2013 is non-dischargeable as \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury. 523 U.S. at 219 (rejecting debtor\u2019s\n\n        effort to \u201cimpose[] a restitutionary ceiling on the extent to which [his] liability for fraud is\n\n        nondischargeable\u201d). Instead, Cohen holds that \u00a7 523(a)\u2019s exceptions may reach punitive\n\n        and other related ancillary debts. \u201cOnce it is established that specific money\u201d is \u201cfor\u201d fraud,\n\n        willful and malicious injury, or other conduct excepted under \u00a7 523(a), then \u201c\u2018any debt\u2019\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762        Doc: 36         Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 14 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        arising\u201d from the injury \u2013 not only the part of the debt that makes the victim whole \u2013 is\n\n        non-dischargeable. 523 U.S. at 218.\n\n                 Second, Cohen reaches this result through a \u201cbroad\u201d reading of the relevant statutory\n\n        text: the introductory phrase \u201cdebt for.\u201d See In re Pleasants, 219 F.3d 372, 375 (4th Cir.\n\n        2000).     Those words, Cohen instructs, should not be read narrowly or in a purely\n\n        \u201crestitutionary sense\u201d; instead, they \u201cconnot[e] broadly any liability arising from the\n\n        specified object\u201d \u2013 fraud, willful and malicious injury, or the like. 523 U.S. at 220\n\n        (emphasis added). As we explained at the outset, the Supreme Court spoke here in\n\n        decidedly expansive terms, equating \u201cdebt for\u201d with \u201c\u2018debt as a result of,\u2019 \u2018debt with\n\n        respect to,\u2019 debt by reason of,\u2019 and the like.\u201d Id. Any debt \u201carising from\u201d or incurred \u201con\n\n        account of\u201d an excepted ground qualifies as \u201cdebt for\u201d that ground under \u00a7 523(a). See id.\n\n                 The collection debts here fit that description. Like the principal owed under the\n\n        settlement agreement, these debts, too, were incurred \u201cas a result of\u201d or \u201con account of\u201d\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s assaults on Yagi. But for the assaults, there would have been no settlement\n\n        agreement and no collection debt. And, critically, the entire settlement \u201carose from\u201d the\n\n        same willful and malicious injuries. As the district court explained, both the attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees and the late-payment interest are mechanisms \u2013 for which the parties bargained \u2013 to\n\n        enforce and collect on the non-dischargeable principal. Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 125. In\n\n        effect, Yagi agreed to release her claim for willful and malicious injury if Hilgartner paid\n\n\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36           Filed: 01/18/2024   Pg: 15 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        the principal and the costs of collecting it; the principal and the collection debts are\n\n        \u201cinextricably linked.\u201d Id.\n\n               The bankruptcy court reasoned that the collection debts \u201care not fairly traceable to\n\n        the injuries\u201d because they result only from \u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d rather than\n\n        \u201cflow[ing] directly from the injuries sustained.\u201d J.A. 144. But that is the same logic\n\n        rejected by Archer when it held that a debt for money promised in a settlement agreement\n\n        could also be a \u201cdebt for\u201d an underlying fraud and thus non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a).\n\n        See 538 U.S. at 319. As Archer makes clear, a settlement agreement does not disrupt the\n\n        causal chain. Hilgartner\u2019s collection debts, which \u201cflow directly from [the] agreement for\n\n        the express purpose of enforcing its terms,\u201d Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 125, remain \u201ctraceable\n\n        to,\u201d Cohen, 523 U.S. at 219, the injury he inflicted on Yagi. The settlement simply\n\n        formalized a bargain \u2013 a bargain that envisioned compensation for injury and collection\n\n        alike \u2013 to resolve claims arising from willful and malicious injury. Under Archer and\n\n        Cohen, that is enough to make Hilgartner\u2019s collection debts, like his principal debt, non-\n\n        dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). 4\n\n               Our conclusion aligns with the weight of authority, which, like the district court\n\n        here, treats any contrast between \u201cfees spent to execute a settlement agreement\u201d and \u201cfees\n\n\n\n               4\n                 As the district court recognized, Cohen of course does not create any independent\n        right to attorney\u2019s fees for collection on a non-dischargeable debt. Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at\n        124. Section 523(a) governs the dischargeability of debts, not their existence, and there\n        must be an independent legal basis for any collection debts. See, e.g., Matter of Sheridan,\n        105 F.3d 1164, 1166 (7th Cir. 1997). Here, there is no dispute that the settlement\n        agreement created the debts.\n\n                                                     15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 16 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        spent to enforce that same agreement\u201d as a \u201cdistinction without a difference.\u201d Hilgartner,\n\n        643 B.R. at 125. For example, the Eighth Circuit adopted this approach \u2013 even pre-Cohen\n\n        \u2013 in a case with facts mirroring ours, where a contract granted \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d\n\n        to the party \u201cprevailing in any matter arising under the contract documents.\u201d In re Alport,\n\n        144 F.3d 1163, 1168 (8th Cir. 1998). In those circumstances, the court held, attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees incurred in enforcing the contract \u201cwere properly included in the nondischargeable\n\n        debt . . . because attorney\u2019s fees provided by contract, like accrued interest, can become\n\n        part of the debt.\u201d Id. (citing In re Hunter, 771 F.2d 1126, 1131 (8th Cir. 1985)). Likewise,\n\n        the Seventh Circuit explained that because \u201c[a]ttorneys\u2019 fees, no less than the principal and\n\n        interest, are the result of\u201d the conduct excepting a debt from discharge, all those amounts\n\n        are non-dischargeable as \u201cpart of\u201d the non-dischargeable debt. Mayer v. Spanel Int\u2019l Ltd.,\n\n        51 F.3d 670, 677 (7th Cir. 1995). In our view, these cases \u2013 and others like them 5 \u2013 best\n\n\n\n               5\n                  See TranSouth Fin. Corp. of Fla. v.

At trial, the bankruptcy court permitted Yagi to introduce a chart listing the\n\n        due date of each installment payment owed under the settlement agreement, whether and\n\n        in what amount Hilgartner had paid, and the cumulative totals owed. Hilgartner argues\n\n        that the introduction of this chart violated Federal Rule of Evidence 1006, which permits\n\n        the use of such a chart only if the documents on which it is based are made available to the\n\n        other parties. See Fed. R. Evid. 1006; United States v. Janati, 374 F.3d 263, 272\u201373 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2004). We review this evidentiary dispute for abuse of discretion, Janati, 374 F.3d at\n\n        275, and for two reasons, we find no reversible error here.\n\n               First, Hilgartner likely forfeited this objection by failing to raise it at trial before the\n\n        bankruptcy court. See Padilla v. Troxell, 850 F.3d 168, 177\u201378 (4th Cir. 2017). Hilgartner\n\n        objected repeatedly to other aspects of the chart, including whether Yagi had personal\n\n        knowledge of its contents. But \u201c[a]n evidentiary objection on one basis is insufficient to\n\n\n\n        (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 1999) (explaining that Cohen confirms the holding of In re Alport, 144\n        F.3d 1163 (8th Cir. 1998)).\n               6\n                 While Cohen\u2019s language is broad, it is not unlimited. As the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n        Bankruptcy Appellate Panel cautioned, \u201cIt may be that the relationship of ancillary to\n        primary obligations can become so attenuated that it would be unreasonable to characterize\n        them as integral to the original willful and malicious injury.\u201d In re Florida, 164 B.R. at\n        639. But we need not define those outer limits today because, whatever they are, the\n        collection debts at issue here fall on the non-dischargeable side of the line.\n\n                                                       17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762      Doc: 36         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 18 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        preserve an evidentiary objection on a different basis,\u201d id. at 178, and Hilgartner never\n\n        objected on the ground that Yagi had failed to provide him the original documents on which\n\n        her chart was based. 7\n\n               And regardless, we are convinced that any error here was harmless. See United\n\n        States v. Wilkinson, 137 F.3d 214, 229 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding harmless an assumed Rule\n\n        1006 error in failing to offer original documentation for chart). The figures in Yagi\u2019s chart\n\n        reflected only information to which Hilgartner had complete and ready access: the amounts\n\n        that left his own bank account as payments toward the principal under the settlement\n\n        agreement, and due dates and interest amounts that came straight from the settlement\n\n        agreement itself. See Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 127. If Hilgartner wished to \u201ctest the\n\n        accuracy of the chart\u2019s summarization,\u201d in other words, he already had all the tools to do\n\n        so, see Janati, 374 F.3d at 273 (describing \u201cobvious import\u201d of Rule 1006\u2019s disclosure\n\n        requirement) \u2013 and yet he produced no evidence to challenge any of the chart\u2019s\n\n        calculations. In these circumstances, any disclosure error under Rule 1006 was harmless.\n\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n               For the reasons given above, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                                                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n               7\n                For the sake of clarity, we note that the bankruptcy court did sustain a Rule 1006\n        objection to a different exhibit. But neither that exhibit nor that objection bears on the\n        question before us.\n\n                                                     18\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 22-1762   Doc: 36        Filed: 01/18/2024   Pg: 1 of 18\n\n\n\n\n                                          PUBLISHED\n\n                           UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                               FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                           No. 22-1762\n\n\n        In re: LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Debtor.\n\n\n        YASUKO YAGI,\n\n                         Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n                   v.\n\n        LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n                                           No. 22-1778\n\n\n        In re: LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Debtor.\n\n\n        YASUKO YAGI,\n\n                         Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n                   v.\n\n        LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Defendant - Appellant.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762     Doc: 36         Filed: 01/18/2024    Pg: 2 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, at\n        Alexandria.

It is no longer disputed that the debtor here caused \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of that exception. Instead, the parties spar over\n\n        two questions: whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation over a \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d creates a non-dischargeable \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury; and, if so, whether\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762        Doc: 36        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 4 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable\n\n        under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               In 2010, Lee Andrew Hilgartner physically assaulted Yasuko Yagi in two separate\n\n        incidents. After the assaults, the parties entered into two agreements obligating Hilgartner\n\n        to compensate Yagi for the harm he caused her. The first, not directly at issue here,\n\n        describes the assaults, with Hilgartner admitting to \u201cgrab[bing]\u201d Yagi \u201cby the hair,\u201d\n\n        \u201chit[ting] her head and shoulders\u201d into a car door, and \u201cgrab[bing] both of her arms\n\n        forcefully, resulting in bruising on her arms and hands.\u201d J.A. 131. That agreement required\n\n        Hilgartner to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments.\n\n               Yagi did not release her claims, however, and years later she and Hilgartner entered\n\n        into the settlement agreement that gives rise to this case. The agreement reiterates\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s \u201cfactual and legal responsibility\u201d for \u201chis infliction of . . . Yagi\u2019s injuries.\u201d\n\n        J.A. 70. It then explains that in order \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation,\u201d id.,\n\n        Hilgartner will pay Yagi $415,000 (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) in installments, as well as fifteen\n\n        percent interest on untimely payments. The agreement also grants reasonable attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees to the prevailing party in any action commenced to enforce or interpret the settlement.\n\n               Though Hilgartner paid a chunk of his obligation \u2013 totaling $185,955 over some\n\n        years \u2013 he did not keep up. Instead, he stopped paying, and in 2019, Yagi sued to enforce\n\n        the settlement agreement. See Yagi v. Hilgartner, No. 1:19-cv-01305-RDA-TCB (E.D.\n\n        Va.). Two days before a scheduled hearing on Yagi\u2019s motion for default judgment,\n\n        Hilgartner filed for bankruptcy, thereby staying Yagi\u2019s enforcement action. Yagi filed a\n\n                                                      4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762       Doc: 36        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 5 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        proof of claim with the bankruptcy court and objected to Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy plan on\n\n        the ground that the debt he owed her was non-dischargeable as a debt for willful and\n\n        malicious injury.\n\n               Yagi then filed the action from which this appeal arises: a complaint to determine\n\n        the dischargeability of Hilgartner\u2019s debt to her. She sought a declaration that the full\n\n        amount Hilgartner owed her under the settlement agreement \u2013 including, as relevant here,\n\n        not only unpaid principal but also interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in\n\n        enforcing the settlement \u2013 was non-dischargeable because the agreement \u201cintended to\n\n        compensate [her] for the injuries she sustained from [Hilgartner\u2019s] intentional and\n\n        malicious actions.\u201d J.A. 68\u201369.\n\n                                                    C.\n\n               In the bankruptcy court, Hilgartner vigorously disputed whether he had inflicted\n\n        \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6) by assaulting Yagi. The\n\n        bankruptcy court concluded that he had, crediting Yagi\u2019s testimony and Hilgartner\u2019s\n\n        \u201cwritten acknowledgements of the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d J.A. 140\u201341. As a result,\n\n        it held the unpaid $229,045 of the principal \u2013 the $415,000 the agreement demanded less\n\n        the $185,955 Hilgartner had already paid \u2013 non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). J.A. 141.\n\n               But the bankruptcy court reached a different conclusion regarding other debts due\n\n        under the settlement agreement, which we refer to together here as \u201ccollection debts\u201d: the\n\n        fifteen percent interest accrued on Hilgartner\u2019s tardy payments and the attorney\u2019s fees Yagi\n\n        incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement. J.A. 142. In analyzing those amounts,\n\n        the bankruptcy court recognized that all debts \u201carising from\u201d willful and malicious injury\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1762       Doc: 36          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 6 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        are covered by \u00a7 523(a)(6) and hence non-dischargeable.

J.A. 144.\n\n               On appeal to the district court, Hilgartner argued that the bankruptcy court erred in\n\n        finding any part of his debt non-dischargeable.

The bankruptcy court, as\n\n        noted above, held these debts dischargeable because, in its view, they arose not \u201cdirectly\u201d\n\n        from the assaults but rather \u201ccame into being years later when the parties signed the\n\n        Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344.

The question in this case is whether and to what\n\n        extent money owed under a pre-suit settlement agreement arising from such injury falls\n\n        within the scope of \u00a7 523(a)(6). We agree with the district court that the debts at issue here\n\n        are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                                                     A.\n\n               To give debtors a \u201cfresh start,\u201d the Bankruptcy Code starts from a \u201cpresumption of\n\n        dischargeability.\u201d In re Strack, 524 F.3d 493, 496\u201397 (4th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\n\n        marks omitted). Under that presumption, \u201c\u2018all legal obligations of the debtor, no matter\n\n        how remote or contingent\u2019 are potentially dischargeable in bankruptcy.\u201d Id. at 497 (quoting\n\n        H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 309 (1977)).\n\n               But there are exceptions to the general rule of dischargeability, set out by Congress\n\n        in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). Id.; see Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 138 S. Ct. 1752,\n\n        1758 (2018). This case turns on one such exception, barring the discharge of \u201cany debt . . .\n\n        for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another\n\n        entity.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). It is no longer disputed that the debtor here caused \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of that exception. Instead, the parties spar over\n\n        two questions: whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation over a \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d creates a non-dischargeable \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury; and, if so, whether\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778        Doc: 34        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 4 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable\n\n        under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               In 2010, Lee Andrew Hilgartner physically assaulted Yasuko Yagi in two separate\n\n        incidents. After the assaults, the parties entered into two agreements obligating Hilgartner\n\n        to compensate Yagi for the harm he caused her. The first, not directly at issue here,\n\n        describes the assaults, with Hilgartner admitting to \u201cgrab[bing]\u201d Yagi \u201cby the hair,\u201d\n\n        \u201chit[ting] her head and shoulders\u201d into a car door, and \u201cgrab[bing] both of her arms\n\n        forcefully, resulting in bruising on her arms and hands.\u201d J.A. 131. That agreement required\n\n        Hilgartner to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments.\n\n               Yagi did not release her claims, however, and years later she and Hilgartner entered\n\n        into the settlement agreement that gives rise to this case. The agreement reiterates\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s \u201cfactual and legal responsibility\u201d for \u201chis infliction of . . . Yagi\u2019s injuries.\u201d\n\n        J.A. 70. It then explains that in order \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation,\u201d id.,\n\n        Hilgartner will pay Yagi $415,000 (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) in installments, as well as fifteen\n\n        percent interest on untimely payments. The agreement also grants reasonable attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees to the prevailing party in any action commenced to enforce or interpret the settlement.\n\n               Though Hilgartner paid a chunk of his obligation \u2013 totaling $185,955 over some\n\n        years \u2013 he did not keep up. Instead, he stopped paying, and in 2019, Yagi sued to enforce\n\n        the settlement agreement. See Yagi v. Hilgartner, No. 1:19-cv-01305-RDA-TCB (E.D.\n\n        Va.). Two days before a scheduled hearing on Yagi\u2019s motion for default judgment,\n\n        Hilgartner filed for bankruptcy, thereby staying Yagi\u2019s enforcement action. Yagi filed a\n\n                                                      4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778       Doc: 34        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 5 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        proof of claim with the bankruptcy court and objected to Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy plan on\n\n        the ground that the debt he owed her was non-dischargeable as a debt for willful and\n\n        malicious injury.\n\n               Yagi then filed the action from which this appeal arises: a complaint to determine\n\n        the dischargeability of Hilgartner\u2019s debt to her. She sought a declaration that the full\n\n        amount Hilgartner owed her under the settlement agreement \u2013 including, as relevant here,\n\n        not only unpaid principal but also interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in\n\n        enforcing the settlement \u2013 was non-dischargeable because the agreement \u201cintended to\n\n        compensate [her] for the injuries she sustained from [Hilgartner\u2019s] intentional and\n\n        malicious actions.\u201d J.A. 68\u201369.\n\n                                                    C.\n\n               In the bankruptcy court, Hilgartner vigorously disputed whether he had inflicted\n\n        \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6) by assaulting Yagi. The\n\n        bankruptcy court concluded that he had, crediting Yagi\u2019s testimony and Hilgartner\u2019s\n\n        \u201cwritten acknowledgements of the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d J.A. 140\u201341. As a result,\n\n        it held the unpaid $229,045 of the principal \u2013 the $415,000 the agreement demanded less\n\n        the $185,955 Hilgartner had already paid \u2013 non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). J.A. 141.\n\n               But the bankruptcy court reached a different conclusion regarding other debts due\n\n        under the settlement agreement, which we refer to together here as \u201ccollection debts\u201d: the\n\n        fifteen percent interest accrued on Hilgartner\u2019s tardy payments and the attorney\u2019s fees Yagi\n\n        incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement. J.A. 142. In analyzing those amounts,\n\n        the bankruptcy court recognized that all debts \u201carising from\u201d willful and malicious injury\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778       Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 6 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        are covered by \u00a7 523(a)(6) and hence non-dischargeable. J.A. 142 (citing Cohen v. de la\n\n        Cruz, 523 U.S. 213, 223 (1998)). But, the court reasoned, the collection debts \u2013 unlike the\n\n        principal debt \u2013 \u201cd[id] not flow directly from the injuries sustained\u201d but instead \u201ccame into\n\n        being years later when the parties signed the Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344. That\n\n        separation between injury and liability, it believed, took the collection debts outside the\n\n        terms of \u00a7 523(a)(6) and made them dischargeable. J.A. 144.\n\n               On appeal to the district court, Hilgartner argued that the bankruptcy court erred in\n\n        finding any part of his debt non-dischargeable. According to Hilgartner, neither the\n\n        principal debt nor the collection debt came within the \u00a7 523(a)(6) exception, because both\n\n        arose from a settlement agreement rather than a judgment.              It followed, Hilgartner\n\n        contended, that his entire debt was \u201cfor\u201d a breach of contract \u2013 and thus dischargeable in\n\n        bankruptcy \u2013 rather than \u201cfor\u201d a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n               The district court disagreed on both counts, affirming in part and reversing in part\n\n        the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Hilgartner v. Yagi, 643 B.R. 107, 127 (E.D. Va. 2022).\n\n        The district court first addressed the dischargeability of the outstanding principal amount\n\n        of $229,045. Here, it agreed with the bankruptcy court, rejecting Hilgartner\u2019s contention\n\n        that the settlement agreement had \u201cconvert[ed]\u201d a non-dischargeable \u201ctort claim\u201d into a\n\n        dischargeable \u201ccontract claim.\u201d Id. at 117. Like the bankruptcy court, the district court\n\n        concluded that Supreme Court precedent \u201csquarely resolved\u201d this issue in Yagi\u2019s favor: In\n\n        Archer v. Warner, 538 U.S. 314 (2003), \u201cthe Court held that . . . money promised in a\n\n        settlement contract arising out of [a] tort . . . retain[s] the character of the underlying tort\u201d\n\n        for dischargeability purposes.

Id. (quoting Brown v. Felsen, 442\n\n        U.S. 127, 138 (1979)). Because the settlement agreement here arose out of a willful and\n\n        malicious injury, it created a non-dischargeable debt. Id. at 119. 1\n\n               But the district court departed from the bankruptcy court as to the collection debts.\n\n        The district court saw no reason to disaggregate, for purposes of dischargeability under\n\n        \u00a7 523(a)(6), \u201ca settlement award flowing from tortious conduct\u201d and \u201cancillary costs meant\n\n        to enforce and collect on\u201d that settlement award. Id. at 125. Both debts \u201caris[e]\u201d from the\n\n        same willful and malicious injury, the court reasoned, so both debts are non-dischargeable.\n\n        Id. at 123\u201326 (quoting Cohen, 523 U.S. at 218).\n\n               Hilgartner timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               On appeal, Hilgartner presses the same arguments as before the district court. His\n\n        opening position is that both his principal debt and his collection debt are dischargeable\n\n        because both are routine debts for breach of contract \u2013 the settlement agreement \u2013 rather\n\n        than debts for the underlying willful and malicious injury. But even if the principal amount\n\n        owed under the settlement agreement is non-dischargeable, he continues, the bankruptcy\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                 Although Hilgartner did not appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that he\n        had inflicted a \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(6), the district court\n        performed a de novo review of that conclusion and agreed. Id. Hilgartner again declines\n        to challenge that holding before us, so we consider it resolved.\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 8 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        court had it right: The collection debt is one step further removed from the original tort\n\n        and thus falls outside the scope of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n               \u201cWhen considering an appeal from a district court acting in its capacity as a\n\n        bankruptcy appellate court,\u201d we conduct \u201can independent review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s\n\n        decision, reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.\u201d\n\n        SummitBridge Nat\u2019l Invs. III, LLC v.

Hilgartner does not appeal any factual determinations as clearly erroneous, nor\n\n        does he challenge the conclusion that he inflicted willful and malicious injury within the\n\n        meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6). Instead, this appeal turns primarily on one legal question: whether\n\n        the Bankruptcy Code permits Hilgartner to discharge his debt to Yagi. 2\n\n                                                     A.\n\n               A \u201cdebt\u201d falls within \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u2019s exception from discharge if it is \u201cfor willful and\n\n        malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\u201d 11\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). In this case, the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d is now a given; the issue\n\n        is whether amounts due under the parties\u2019 settlement agreement are \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury.\n\n        And on that question, the Supreme Court has provided important guidance, instructing that\n\n        the introductory phrase \u201cdebt for\u201d \u2013 which prefaces most of \u00a7 523(a)\u2019s exceptions to\n\n\n               2\n                  Hilgartner also challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s calculation of the principal\n        amount due under the settlement and its allowance of interest accrued prior to the filing of\n        his petition. The bankruptcy and district courts both rejected Hilgartner\u2019s arguments on\n        these fronts, see J.A. 142 n.6, 145; Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 120\u201321, 126, and we find no\n        error in their holdings.\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 9 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        discharge \u2013 \u201cconnot[es] broadly any liability arising from the specified\u201d conduct.

Indeed, like those courts, we consider the issue squarely\n\n        resolved by Supreme Court precedent.\n\n               In Archer v. Warner, 538 U.S. 314 (2003), the Supreme Court rejected an argument\n\n        nearly identical to Hilgartner\u2019s. That case involved a debt under an agreement settling a\n\n        lawsuit for fraud. And while a debt for money obtained by fraud is excepted from\n\n        discharge, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), the debtor argued \u2013 like Hilgartner here \u2013 that his\n\n        debt was dischargeable, because it was for breach of the settlement agreement rather than\n\n        for the underlying fraud. His settlement agreement, in other words, had \u201creplaced\u201d his\n\n        non-dischargeable debt for fraud with a dischargeable debt for breach of contract. Archer,\n\n        538 U.S. at 318. The Supreme Court disagreed. The Bankruptcy Code, it explained,\n\n        required it to \u201clook behind\u201d the settlement \u201cto determine whether it reflected settlement of\u201d\n\n        an otherwise non-dischargeable claim. Id. at 320. If it did, then the settlement debt was\n\n        also non-dischargeable, even though collection on that debt sounded in contract rather than\n\n        tort. Id. at 320\u201321.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778        Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024          Pg: 10 of 18\n\n\n\n\n                 Archer understood itself to be \u201cgovern[ed]\u201d by Brown v. Felsen, 442 U.S. 127\n\n        (1979). Archer, 538 U.S. at 319. Brown involved similar circumstances but featured a\n\n        consent decree rather than an out-of-court settlement. Archer, 538 U.S. at 319\u201321. That\n\n        made no difference, the Archer Court concluded: \u201cA debt embodied in the settlement of a\n\n        fraud case \u2018arises\u2019 no less \u2018out of\u2019 the underlying fraud than a debt embodied in a stipulation\n\n        and consent decree.\u201d Id. at 321.\n\n                 As Brown governed Archer, so Archer governs here:                      Hilgartner\u2019s non-\n\n        dischargeable debt for \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d may have been reduced to a\n\n        settlement agreement, but that does not \u201cchange[] the nature of the debt for dischargeability\n\n        purposes.\u201d Id. at 320.\n\n                 Hilgartner gestures at two distinctions from Archer, but neither makes a difference.\n\n        First, Archer, as noted above, concerned a different subsection of \u00a7 523(a), excepting from\n\n        discharge \u201cany debt . . . for money . . . to the extent obtained by . . . actual fraud.\u201d 11\n\n        U.S.C.     \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).      But    as   the        Supreme    Court   explained   in   Cohen,\n\n        the phrase \u201cto the extent obtained by\u201d does not speak to whether a particular debt is\n\n        traceable to or arises from fraud for purposes of dischargeability. 523 U.S. at 218. Instead,\n\n        that inquiry is governed by the introductory words \u201cdebt for,\u201d id. at 219\u201320 \u2013 precisely the\n\n        same words that introduce \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u2019s \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d exception, subject\n\n        to the same broad reading. See id. at 220 (\u201cBecause each use of \u2018debt for\u2019 in \u00a7 523(a)\n\n        serves the identical function of introducing a category of nondischargeable debt, the\n\n        presumption that equivalent words have equivalent meaning when repeated in the same\n\n        statute has particular resonance here.\u201d (internal citation omitted)). There is thus no textual\n\n                                                          10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778        Doc: 34       Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 11 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        basis for limiting Archer to the specific subsection under which it was decided. See In re\n\n        Detrano, 326 F.3d 319, 322 (2d Cir. 2003) (explaining that case arising under different\n\n        \u00a7 523(a) exception to discharge is \u201cnonetheless control[led]\u201d by Archer).\n\n               Second, Hilgartner notes that the settlement agreement in Archer resolved an\n\n        existing lawsuit, while this settlement agreement preempted a lawsuit. See J.A. 70 (stating\n\n        that parties are entering agreement \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation\u201d). Again,\n\n        the statutory question is whether debt embodied in a settlement agreement is \u201cdebt for\u201d the\n\n        underlying tort claim, and whether the agreement comes before or after litigation has no\n\n        obvious bearing on that point. Indeed, the Supreme Court rejected just this sort of\n\n        technicality in Archer: There was no reason, the Court explained, why it would matter that\n\n        the debt at issue in Brown was reduced to a consent judgment while the debt at issue in\n\n        Archer was embodied in a settlement agreement; both debts arose out of fraud. Archer,\n\n        538 U.S. at 321. By the same token, here, a debt embodied in a pre-suit settlement that\n\n        resolves a claim for willful and malicious injury \u201c\u2018arises\u2019 no less \u2018out of\u2019 the underlying\n\n        [tort] than a debt embodied\u201d in a post-suit settlement. Id. What matters is the \u201ctrue nature\u201d\n\n        of the debt, id. (quoting Brown, 442 U.S. at 138), not the form of the legal instrument in\n\n        which it is reflected. 3\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  While courts rarely note any distinction between pre- and post-suit settlements in\n        this context, it appears that they generally apply Archer to debts arising from both. See,\n        e.g., In re Hathaway, 364 B.R. 220, 241\u201343 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2007) (applying Archer to\n        pre-suit settlement).\n\n                                                     11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 12 of 18\n\n\n\n\n               Cases may arise where the absence of an underlying lawsuit makes it more difficult,\n\n        as a practical matter, for the creditor to demonstrate that a debt embodied in an agreement\n\n        is \u201cfor\u201d willful or malicious injury or some other non-dischargeable claim. See In re Muhs,\n\n        923 F.3d 377, 384 (4th Cir. 2019) (creditor bears burden of proving non-dischargeability\n\n        by preponderance of the evidence). This is not such a case. The settlement agreement\n\n        itself answers any questions on that front: The debt is \u201cfor the pain, damage, and suffering\u201d\n\n        Hilgartner caused Yagi in \u201caltercation[s]\u201d on two dates in 2010. J.A. 70. Because \u2013 as all\n\n        now agree \u2013 those altercations inflicted \u201cwillful and malicious injury,\u201d Hilgartner cannot\n\n        discharge the debts arising therefrom.\n\n                                                     2.\n\n               We turn now to the issue that divided the bankruptcy court and district court: the\n\n        dischargeability of what we are calling the \u201ccollection debts.\u201d These are liabilities arising\n\n        from the terms of the settlement agreement and triggered by Yagi\u2019s efforts to collect on\n\n        that agreement: interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in enforcing the\n\n        agreement and contesting Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. We conclude that, like the\n\n        principal, these debts \u201caris[e] from\u201d willful and malicious injury, Cohen, 523 U.S. at 223,\n\n        and are therefore likewise non-dischargeable.\n\n               An initial clarification: The attorney\u2019s fees incurred in executing the settlement\n\n        agreement \u2013 as opposed to collecting on it \u2013 are not in controversy. Those fees are not\n\n        dischargeable for two reasons. Most straightforwardly, the settlement agreement explicitly\n\n        absorbed the fees into the principal, J.A. 70\u201371, which, as explained above, is not\n\n        dischargeable. And in any event, Cohen establishes that attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778       Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 13 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        creation of a non-dischargeable debt are also non-dischargeable, as part of the \u201cfull liability\n\n        traceable\u201d to the underlying injury. Cohen, 523 U.S. at 219.\n\n               What is disputed here are the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in collecting on the settlement\n\n        agreement and contesting Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy court, as\n\n        noted above, held these debts dischargeable because, in its view, they arose not \u201cdirectly\u201d\n\n        from the assaults but rather \u201ccame into being years later when the parties signed the\n\n        Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344. And the same was true, it held, with respect to the\n\n        interest that accumulated when Hilgartner paid his installments late.\n\n               Like the district court, we disagree. And like the district court, we think the Supreme\n\n        Court\u2019s decision in Cohen points toward the opposite result. In Cohen, the Court held that\n\n        treble damages from \u201cactual fraud\u201d \u2013 and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigating the fraud \u2013\n\n        are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)\u2019s exception for \u201cdebt for\u201d money obtained\n\n        through such fraud. See 523 U.S. at 215; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). That case establishes\n\n        two propositions important to this case.\n\n               First, Cohen forecloses any argument that only the portion of Hilgartner\u2019s debt\n\n        commensurate with the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d he inflicted \u2013 the \u201crestitutionary\u201d\n\n        portion \u2013 is non-dischargeable as \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury. 523 U.S. at 219 (rejecting debtor\u2019s\n\n        effort to \u201cimpose[] a restitutionary ceiling on the extent to which [his] liability for fraud is\n\n        nondischargeable\u201d). Instead, Cohen holds that \u00a7 523(a)\u2019s exceptions may reach punitive\n\n        and other related ancillary debts. \u201cOnce it is established that specific money\u201d is \u201cfor\u201d fraud,\n\n        willful and malicious injury, or other conduct excepted under \u00a7 523(a), then \u201c\u2018any debt\u2019\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778        Doc: 34         Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 14 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        arising\u201d from the injury \u2013 not only the part of the debt that makes the victim whole \u2013 is\n\n        non-dischargeable. 523 U.S. at 218.\n\n                 Second, Cohen reaches this result through a \u201cbroad\u201d reading of the relevant statutory\n\n        text: the introductory phrase \u201cdebt for.\u201d See In re Pleasants, 219 F.3d 372, 375 (4th Cir.\n\n        2000).     Those words, Cohen instructs, should not be read narrowly or in a purely\n\n        \u201crestitutionary sense\u201d; instead, they \u201cconnot[e] broadly any liability arising from the\n\n        specified object\u201d \u2013 fraud, willful and malicious injury, or the like. 523 U.S. at 220\n\n        (emphasis added). As we explained at the outset, the Supreme Court spoke here in\n\n        decidedly expansive terms, equating \u201cdebt for\u201d with \u201c\u2018debt as a result of,\u2019 \u2018debt with\n\n        respect to,\u2019 debt by reason of,\u2019 and the like.\u201d Id. Any debt \u201carising from\u201d or incurred \u201con\n\n        account of\u201d an excepted ground qualifies as \u201cdebt for\u201d that ground under \u00a7 523(a). See id.\n\n                 The collection debts here fit that description. Like the principal owed under the\n\n        settlement agreement, these debts, too, were incurred \u201cas a result of\u201d or \u201con account of\u201d\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s assaults on Yagi. But for the assaults, there would have been no settlement\n\n        agreement and no collection debt. And, critically, the entire settlement \u201carose from\u201d the\n\n        same willful and malicious injuries. As the district court explained, both the attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees and the late-payment interest are mechanisms \u2013 for which the parties bargained \u2013 to\n\n        enforce and collect on the non-dischargeable principal. Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 125. In\n\n        effect, Yagi agreed to release her claim for willful and malicious injury if Hilgartner paid\n\n\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34           Filed: 01/18/2024   Pg: 15 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        the principal and the costs of collecting it; the principal and the collection debts are\n\n        \u201cinextricably linked.\u201d Id.\n\n               The bankruptcy court reasoned that the collection debts \u201care not fairly traceable to\n\n        the injuries\u201d because they result only from \u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d rather than\n\n        \u201cflow[ing] directly from the injuries sustained.\u201d J.A. 144. But that is the same logic\n\n        rejected by Archer when it held that a debt for money promised in a settlement agreement\n\n        could also be a \u201cdebt for\u201d an underlying fraud and thus non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a).\n\n        See 538 U.S. at 319. As Archer makes clear, a settlement agreement does not disrupt the\n\n        causal chain. Hilgartner\u2019s collection debts, which \u201cflow directly from [the] agreement for\n\n        the express purpose of enforcing its terms,\u201d Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 125, remain \u201ctraceable\n\n        to,\u201d Cohen, 523 U.S. at 219, the injury he inflicted on Yagi. The settlement simply\n\n        formalized a bargain \u2013 a bargain that envisioned compensation for injury and collection\n\n        alike \u2013 to resolve claims arising from willful and malicious injury. Under Archer and\n\n        Cohen, that is enough to make Hilgartner\u2019s collection debts, like his principal debt, non-\n\n        dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). 4\n\n               Our conclusion aligns with the weight of authority, which, like the district court\n\n        here, treats any contrast between \u201cfees spent to execute a settlement agreement\u201d and \u201cfees\n\n\n\n               4\n                 As the district court recognized, Cohen of course does not create any independent\n        right to attorney\u2019s fees for collection on a non-dischargeable debt. Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at\n        124. Section 523(a) governs the dischargeability of debts, not their existence, and there\n        must be an independent legal basis for any collection debts. See, e.g., Matter of Sheridan,\n        105 F.3d 1164, 1166 (7th Cir. 1997). Here, there is no dispute that the settlement\n        agreement created the debts.\n\n                                                     15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 16 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        spent to enforce that same agreement\u201d as a \u201cdistinction without a difference.\u201d Hilgartner,\n\n        643 B.R. at 125. For example, the Eighth Circuit adopted this approach \u2013 even pre-Cohen\n\n        \u2013 in a case with facts mirroring ours, where a contract granted \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d\n\n        to the party \u201cprevailing in any matter arising under the contract documents.\u201d In re Alport,\n\n        144 F.3d 1163, 1168 (8th Cir. 1998). In those circumstances, the court held, attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees incurred in enforcing the contract \u201cwere properly included in the nondischargeable\n\n        debt . . . because attorney\u2019s fees provided by contract, like accrued interest, can become\n\n        part of the debt.\u201d Id. (citing In re Hunter, 771 F.2d 1126, 1131 (8th Cir. 1985)). Likewise,\n\n        the Seventh Circuit explained that because \u201c[a]ttorneys\u2019 fees, no less than the principal and\n\n        interest, are the result of\u201d the conduct excepting a debt from discharge, all those amounts\n\n        are non-dischargeable as \u201cpart of\u201d the non-dischargeable debt. Mayer v. Spanel Int\u2019l Ltd.,\n\n        51 F.3d 670, 677 (7th Cir. 1995). In our view, these cases \u2013 and others like them 5 \u2013 best\n\n\n\n               5\n                  See TranSouth Fin. Corp. of Fla. v.

At trial, the bankruptcy court permitted Yagi to introduce a chart listing the\n\n        due date of each installment payment owed under the settlement agreement, whether and\n\n        in what amount Hilgartner had paid, and the cumulative totals owed. Hilgartner argues\n\n        that the introduction of this chart violated Federal Rule of Evidence 1006, which permits\n\n        the use of such a chart only if the documents on which it is based are made available to the\n\n        other parties. See Fed. R. Evid. 1006; United States v. Janati, 374 F.3d 263, 272\u201373 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2004). We review this evidentiary dispute for abuse of discretion, Janati, 374 F.3d at\n\n        275, and for two reasons, we find no reversible error here.\n\n               First, Hilgartner likely forfeited this objection by failing to raise it at trial before the\n\n        bankruptcy court. See Padilla v. Troxell, 850 F.3d 168, 177\u201378 (4th Cir. 2017). Hilgartner\n\n        objected repeatedly to other aspects of the chart, including whether Yagi had personal\n\n        knowledge of its contents. But \u201c[a]n evidentiary objection on one basis is insufficient to\n\n\n\n        (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 1999) (explaining that Cohen confirms the holding of In re Alport, 144\n        F.3d 1163 (8th Cir. 1998)).\n               6\n                 While Cohen\u2019s language is broad, it is not unlimited. As the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n        Bankruptcy Appellate Panel cautioned, \u201cIt may be that the relationship of ancillary to\n        primary obligations can become so attenuated that it would be unreasonable to characterize\n        them as integral to the original willful and malicious injury.\u201d In re Florida, 164 B.R. at\n        639. But we need not define those outer limits today because, whatever they are, the\n        collection debts at issue here fall on the non-dischargeable side of the line.\n\n                                                       17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778      Doc: 34         Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 18 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        preserve an evidentiary objection on a different basis,\u201d id. at 178, and Hilgartner never\n\n        objected on the ground that Yagi had failed to provide him the original documents on which\n\n        her chart was based. 7\n\n               And regardless, we are convinced that any error here was harmless. See United\n\n        States v. Wilkinson, 137 F.3d 214, 229 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding harmless an assumed Rule\n\n        1006 error in failing to offer original documentation for chart). The figures in Yagi\u2019s chart\n\n        reflected only information to which Hilgartner had complete and ready access: the amounts\n\n        that left his own bank account as payments toward the principal under the settlement\n\n        agreement, and due dates and interest amounts that came straight from the settlement\n\n        agreement itself. See Hilgartner, 643 B.R. at 127. If Hilgartner wished to \u201ctest the\n\n        accuracy of the chart\u2019s summarization,\u201d in other words, he already had all the tools to do\n\n        so, see Janati, 374 F.3d at 273 (describing \u201cobvious import\u201d of Rule 1006\u2019s disclosure\n\n        requirement) \u2013 and yet he produced no evidence to challenge any of the chart\u2019s\n\n        calculations. In these circumstances, any disclosure error under Rule 1006 was harmless.\n\n\n\n                                                    III.\n\n               For the reasons given above, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                                                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n               7\n                For the sake of clarity, we note that the bankruptcy court did sustain a Rule 1006\n        objection to a different exhibit. But neither that exhibit nor that objection bears on the\n        question before us.\n\n                                                     18\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 22-1778   Doc: 34        Filed: 01/18/2024   Pg: 1 of 18\n\n\n\n\n                                          PUBLISHED\n\n                           UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                               FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                           No. 22-1762\n\n\n        In re: LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Debtor.\n\n\n        YASUKO YAGI,\n\n                         Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n                   v.\n\n        LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n                                           No. 22-1778\n\n\n        In re: LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Debtor.\n\n\n        YASUKO YAGI,\n\n                         Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n                   v.\n\n        LEE ANDREW HILGARTNER,\n\n                         Defendant - Appellant.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778     Doc: 34         Filed: 01/18/2024    Pg: 2 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, at\n        Alexandria.

It is no longer disputed that the debtor here caused \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of that exception. Instead, the parties spar over\n\n        two questions: whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation over a \u201cwillful\n\n        and malicious injury\u201d creates a non-dischargeable \u201cdebt for\u201d that injury; and, if so, whether\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778        Doc: 34        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 4 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable\n\n        under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               In 2010, Lee Andrew Hilgartner physically assaulted Yasuko Yagi in two separate\n\n        incidents. After the assaults, the parties entered into two agreements obligating Hilgartner\n\n        to compensate Yagi for the harm he caused her. The first, not directly at issue here,\n\n        describes the assaults, with Hilgartner admitting to \u201cgrab[bing]\u201d Yagi \u201cby the hair,\u201d\n\n        \u201chit[ting] her head and shoulders\u201d into a car door, and \u201cgrab[bing] both of her arms\n\n        forcefully, resulting in bruising on her arms and hands.\u201d J.A. 131. That agreement required\n\n        Hilgartner to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments.\n\n               Yagi did not release her claims, however, and years later she and Hilgartner entered\n\n        into the settlement agreement that gives rise to this case. The agreement reiterates\n\n        Hilgartner\u2019s \u201cfactual and legal responsibility\u201d for \u201chis infliction of . . . Yagi\u2019s injuries.\u201d\n\n        J.A. 70. It then explains that in order \u201c[t]o avoid the time and expense of litigation,\u201d id.,\n\n        Hilgartner will pay Yagi $415,000 (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) in installments, as well as fifteen\n\n        percent interest on untimely payments. The agreement also grants reasonable attorney\u2019s\n\n        fees to the prevailing party in any action commenced to enforce or interpret the settlement.\n\n               Though Hilgartner paid a chunk of his obligation \u2013 totaling $185,955 over some\n\n        years \u2013 he did not keep up. Instead, he stopped paying, and in 2019, Yagi sued to enforce\n\n        the settlement agreement. See Yagi v. Hilgartner, No. 1:19-cv-01305-RDA-TCB (E.D.\n\n        Va.). Two days before a scheduled hearing on Yagi\u2019s motion for default judgment,\n\n        Hilgartner filed for bankruptcy, thereby staying Yagi\u2019s enforcement action. Yagi filed a\n\n                                                      4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778       Doc: 34        Filed: 01/18/2024     Pg: 5 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        proof of claim with the bankruptcy court and objected to Hilgartner\u2019s bankruptcy plan on\n\n        the ground that the debt he owed her was non-dischargeable as a debt for willful and\n\n        malicious injury.\n\n               Yagi then filed the action from which this appeal arises: a complaint to determine\n\n        the dischargeability of Hilgartner\u2019s debt to her. She sought a declaration that the full\n\n        amount Hilgartner owed her under the settlement agreement \u2013 including, as relevant here,\n\n        not only unpaid principal but also interest on late payments and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in\n\n        enforcing the settlement \u2013 was non-dischargeable because the agreement \u201cintended to\n\n        compensate [her] for the injuries she sustained from [Hilgartner\u2019s] intentional and\n\n        malicious actions.\u201d J.A. 68\u201369.\n\n                                                    C.\n\n               In the bankruptcy court, Hilgartner vigorously disputed whether he had inflicted\n\n        \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(6) by assaulting Yagi. The\n\n        bankruptcy court concluded that he had, crediting Yagi\u2019s testimony and Hilgartner\u2019s\n\n        \u201cwritten acknowledgements of the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d J.A. 140\u201341. As a result,\n\n        it held the unpaid $229,045 of the principal \u2013 the $415,000 the agreement demanded less\n\n        the $185,955 Hilgartner had already paid \u2013 non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). J.A. 141.\n\n               But the bankruptcy court reached a different conclusion regarding other debts due\n\n        under the settlement agreement, which we refer to together here as \u201ccollection debts\u201d: the\n\n        fifteen percent interest accrued on Hilgartner\u2019s tardy payments and the attorney\u2019s fees Yagi\n\n        incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement. J.A. 142. In analyzing those amounts,\n\n        the bankruptcy court recognized that all debts \u201carising from\u201d willful and malicious injury\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 22-1778       Doc: 34          Filed: 01/18/2024      Pg: 6 of 18\n\n\n\n\n        are covered by \u00a7 523(a)(6) and hence non-dischargeable.

J.A. 144.\n\n               On appeal to the district court, Hilgartner argued that the bankruptcy court erred in\n\n        finding any part of his debt non-dischargeable.

The bankruptcy court, as\n\n        noted above, held these debts dischargeable because, in its view, they arose not \u201cdirectly\u201d\n\n        from the assaults but rather \u201ccame into being years later when the parties signed the\n\n        Settlement Agreement.\u201d J.A. 143\u201344.

The settlement simply\n\n        formalized a bargain \u2013 a bargain that envisioned compensation for injury and collection\n\n        alike \u2013 to resolve claims arising from willful and malicious injury.

See Padilla v.

Hilgartner\n\n        objected repeatedly to other aspects of the chart, including whether Yagi had personal\n\n        knowledge of its contents. But \u201c[a]n evidentiary objection on one basis is insufficient to\n\n\n\n        (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 1999) (explaining that Cohen confirms the holding of In re Alport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754603\"><a href=\"/opinion/754603/in-re-eliot-m-alport-debtor-eliot-m-alport-v-jerry-e-ritter-margaret/\">144\n        F.3d 1163</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1998)).\n               6\n                 While Cohen\u2019s language is broad, it is not unlimited.
