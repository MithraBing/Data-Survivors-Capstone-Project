["In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals under case number PD-0018-23, the appeal came from Continental Heritage Insurance Company, represented by agent Pat Kinnard, who also operates under the name Pat Kinnard Bail Bonds. The appellant was in dispute with the State of Texas concerning a motion for rehearing following an opinion on discretionary review from the Fifth Court of Appeals in Dallas County. The opinion for the unanimous Court was delivered by Keller, P.J.\n\nThe dispute in question centered around whether civil filing fees are part of the court costs that a bonding company, or in some cases, a criminal defendant, must pay if a bond is forfeited. The complexity of the issue arises because while generally, the answer is \"yes\", there are exceptions when a statute exempts the State from liability for a particular filing fee. An exemption can also be overridden if there is another provision that mandates a civil defendant to pay the fee if the State is victorious. The appellant filed a motion for rehearing after the opinion on original submission and the court granted the motion for rehearing, withdrew its previous opinion, and replaced it with a new one. The appellant's arguments influenced part of the reasoning, but the ultimate decision remained the same.\n\nIn terms of background, the case involved a bond forfeiture and associated costs. Darrell David had been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. However, he failed to show up at the trial, leading to the forfeiture of a $10,000 bond under a judgment nisi. A final judgment of forfeiture was signed on October 9, 2020, where the bond was forfeited and the payment of $100 interest, $396 in court costs, and any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the county for the return of the criminal defendant were required. \n\nThe clerk issued a bill of costs on the same day, itemizing a series of charges that totaled $496. These charges included judicial salary fees, clerk fees, court reporter service fees, law library fees, and more. \n\nFollowing this, Continental Heritage filed a motion to correct costs on October 26, 2020. The motion argued that the collection of civil filing fees was not permitted in bond forfeiture proceedings and identified specific fees that it believed it should not have to pay. These contested fees were comprised of the majority of the charges listed in the bill of costs. The motion also contended that the authority to dispute costs was granted by Code of Criminal Procedure article 103.008.\n\nThe dispute was brought before the trial court where the State argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to revise costs under Article 103.008 and maintained that the costs were valid. On the other hand, the appellant argued that the court did have the jurisdiction to address the costs and maintained that it should only have to pay some of the court costs, which it believed totaled $94. The trial court ruled that it had jurisdiction to address the issue of court costs but denied the appellant's motion to revise the costs. \n\nIn response to this decision, the appellant filed a notice of appeal on November 10, 2020. The appeal was then taken to the court of appeal.", "IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS, CASE NO. WR-93,259-02\n\nAPPLICANT: TIVIRUS CRAFT, EX PARTE \n\nTHE MATTER IS REGARDING AN APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, CASE NO. 11084-A IN THE 411TH DISTRICT COURT, ORIGINATING FROM TRINITY COUNTY\n\nPer curiam.\n\nJUDICIAL OPINION\n\nTivirus Craft, the applicant, was found guilty of one count of arson, one count of tampering with evidence, and an additional count of arson. He was handed down a life sentence, twenty years, and two years incarceration respectively for each count. He has since lodged an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the county of conviction, which the district clerk subsequently transmitted to this Court. Refer to TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.07 for further details.\n\nCraft argues that his right to an appeal was violated due to the district clerk's delay in both filing the necessary documents with the appeals court and in notifying the appointed appellate counsel in a timely manner. Based on the evidence presented within the records, the applicant qualifies for relief due to a systemic failure.\n\nRelief is thus granted as per the precedent set in Ex parte Riley, 193 S.W.3d 900 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). Craft is permitted to lodge an out-of-time appeal to his conviction in cause number 11084 from the 411th District Court of Trinity County. The trial court must establish within ten days from the date of this Court\u2019s mandate whether Craft is indigent. In the event that Craft is indeed indigent and requests representation by counsel, the trial court must appoint a lawyer to represent him on his direct appeal. In case Craft decides to proceed with his appeal, he must register a written notice of appeal in the trial court within thirty days from the date of this Court\u2019s mandate.\n\nCopies of this opinion are to be dispatched to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2013Correctional Institutions Division and the Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nDelivered: January 17, 2024\nUnpublished opinion.", "In the Criminal Appeals Court of Texas, two separate cases were reviewed under file numbers: PD-1182-20 and PD-1213-20. The first case involved the State of Texas as the appellant and Trenton Kyle Green as the appellee. The second case consisted of Bobby Carl Lennox, also known as Bobby Carl Leanox, as the appellant against the State of Texas. Both cases were reviewed upon the state's petition for discretionary review from the Sixth Court of Appeals for Gregg County and Lamar County, respectively.\n\nThe opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Slaughter, with Justices Keller, Hervey, Richardson, Newell, Keel, Walker, and McClure joining. Justice Yeary concurred with the opinion. The consolidated cases required interpretation of the 2017 amendments to the Texas Penal Code Section 32.21, known as the forgery statute. According to the statute, an offense is committed if a person forges a writing with the intent to defraud or harm another. The base-level offense is considered a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nIn 2017, the Legislature included a new subsection, (e-1), which presented an alternative 'value ladder' offense-classification scheme. As per this updated provision, if it is shown during the trial of an offense that the actor engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or service, then the offense classification is based on the value of the implicated property or service. The possible offense level begins at a Class C misdemeanor (for forgeries involving property or services valued at less than $100) and stretches to a first-degree felony (for forgeries involving property or services valued at over $300,000). \n\nHowever, the 'value ladder' provision did not replace two original subsections in Section 32.21. These established exceptions to the default offense classification, namely subsections (d) and (e). These original subsections independently state that forgery of a specified type of writing, irrespective of the defendant's motive for committing forgery or the value of any goods or services involved, is either a state-jail felony or a third-degree felony. Subsection (d) states that it is a state-jail felony to commit forgery of one of the enumerated types of financial instruments. Subsection (e) implies that it is a third-degree felony to commit forgery of currency or other governmental records or instruments.\n\nThe 2017 amendments also appended language to subsections (d) and (e) stating that these provisions are \"subject to Subsection (e-1).\" The court's task was to resolve how to apply Section 32.21's competing offense-classification schemes. Specifically, it had to determine when subsections (d) and (e) apply, and when subsection (e-1) applies.\n\nAccording to the relevant portions of Section 32.21, a person commits an offense if he forges a writing with intent to defraud or harm another. Except as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (e-1), an offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor. Subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a state jail felony if the writing is or purports to be one of various types of financial or commercial instruments. Still, subject to Subsection (e-1), an offense under this section is a felony of the third degree if the writing is or purports to be part of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps, a government record mentioned in Section 37.01(2)(C), or other instruments issued by a state or national government or by a subdivision of either, or part of an issue of stock, bonds, or other instruments signifying interests in or claims against another person.\n\nIf proven during the trial of an offense under this section that the actor engaged in the conduct to obtain or attempt to obtain a property or a service, the offense under this section varies. It can be a Class C misdemeanor if the property or service value is less than $100, a Class B misdemeanor if the value is $100 or more but less than $750, a Class A misdemeanor if the value is $750 or more but less than $2,500, a state jail felony if the value is $2,500 or more but less than $30,000, a felony of the third degree if the value is $30,000 or more but less than $150,000, a felony of the second degree if the value is $150,000 or more but less than $300,000, and a felony of the first degree if the value is $300,000 or more. This forms the basis of the 'value ladder' provision introduced in 2017, and the court was tasked with interpreting and applying this provision in light of the existing forgery statute.", "In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case number PD-0963-19, the appellant, Harry Donald Nicholson Jr., came up against the State of Texas. This case was the subject of Nicholson Jr.'s petition for discretionary review from the Tenth Court of Appeals in Navarro County. \n\nThe dispute revolves around TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 38.04(a), which declares that an offense is committed when a person intentionally tries to escape from an individual they know to be a peace officer who is trying to lawfully arrest them. The argument put forward by the majority, to which Justice Yeary disagrees, is that it is not necessary for the accused to be aware of the lawfulness of the officer\u2019s attempt to arrest them. \n\nThe court does acknowledge the importance of plain language when interpreting statutes, as postulated in the Majority Opinion and referencing Nguyen v. State. However, in this case, the court considers the language of the statute in question to be ambiguous, despite it being clear and unambiguous. The court thus considers itself free to determine the interpretation of the statute, an approach that contrasts sharply with a textualist approach to statutory interpretation. \n\nThe court makes a number of other significant errors, according to Justice Yeary. Firstly, it overlooks the clear implications of a 1993 amendment to the relevant statute. The court claims that this amendment merely preserves an \u201cexception\u201d to the offense, while Justice Yeary argues that the legislature could not have been clearer in eliminating the former exception and strengthening the culpable mental state in the definition of the offense. \n\nThe court then claims that the literal interpretation of the current version of the statute leads to an absurd outcome. This is because it believes that this result does not align with the legislative intent, ascertained from sources entirely separate from the statutory language. This approach is not one that Justice Yeary can support.\n\nDespite the disagreements outlined, Justice Yeary concurs with the court's ultimate decision on the case for reasons detailed later in the document. \n\nHowever, he raises a preliminary question regarding why the court is even addressing the issue of whether Section 38.04(a) requires proof of knowledge that the arrest was lawful. This point does not seem to affect the court of appeals\u2019 final decision on the case, and the court does not provide an explanation. \n\nThe court of appeals had reversed Nicholson Jr.'s conviction and returned the case for a new trial. The Court, while responding to Nicholson Jr.'s petition for discretionary review, confirmed that decision. However, the reason for the court of appeals\u2019 decision to reverse the conviction had nothing to do with the issue the Court is currently addressing. The court of appeals reversed the conviction due to a failure in the jury charge to instruct the jury that the accused must have intentionally tried to escape from a peace officer who was trying to lawfully arrest him.", "In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Case No. PD-0653-23, the State of Texas, acting as the appellant, appealed against Anthony Andrew Valle, the appellee. The case focused on the appellee's petition for discretionary review originating from the First Court of Appeals, Harris County. \n\nThe appellee was initially charged with the aggravated sexual assault of a minor and pleaded not guilty, choosing to present his case before a jury per Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.021(a), (e). He made an election pursuant to Article 37.07, \u00a7 2(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, indicating his preference for the jury to decide the punishment. As stipulated by the statute, such an election should be executed before the commencement of voir dire. However, the appellee's election was file-stamped on November 9, 2021, a day following the onset of voir dire.\n\nThe jury later found the appellee guilty. During the punishment phase, he presented a motion to recuse the trial judge and sought a mistrial. His recusal motion was approved, and the newly appointed judge granted his motion for a mistrial concerning both guilt and punishment phases.\n\nIn the subsequent appeal, the State posited that the appellee did not deserve a mistrial on guilt. The court of appeals concurred, deducing that the appellee's election, being filed a day after voir dire had commenced, invalidated the trial court's decision to approve a mistrial concerning guilt under Article 37.07, \u00a7 2(b). Therefore, the court of appeals overturned the trial court's order that had granted the appellee's motion for a mistrial on the guilt phase but upheld the order that granted a mistrial on the punishment phase. This decision was documented in State v. Valle, No. 01-22-00279-CR (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 24, 2023).\n\nIn response, the appellee filed a petition for discretionary review, asserting that the file-stamped date of November 9, 2021, on his election was a clerical error. He cited other documents in the record that were unambiguously file-stamped with incorrect dates. Therefore, he requested the court to grant his petition, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and abate his case.\n\nIn conclusion, the court granted the appellee's petition for discretionary review, nullified the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case back to the court of appeals. The court of appeals was directed to abate the case to allow the trial court to ascertain whether the November 9, 2021 date was a clerical error and, if so, determine the actual date when the appellee's election was filed. This directive was aligned with the provisions of TEX. R. APP. P. 44.4 and Taylor v. State, 247 S.W.3d 223, 223\u201324 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) which suggests that, in the face of a conflicting record, the court of appeals should abate the case to allow the trial court to clarify its intended action. If it is established that the election was filed before the start of voir dire, the court is to reconsider the State's point of error which argued that the appellee was not entitled to a mistrial on guilt. \n\nThis decision was delivered on January 17, 2024, and was not published for broader dissemination.", "Citation: The Supreme Court of Texas, HNMC, Inc. v. Francis S. Chan, Individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Leny Rey Chan, Jonathan Chan, and Justin Chan, No. 22-0053, argued September 14, 2023.\n\nThe following is a detailed examination of the case, which involves a personal injury claim and the responsibilities of a property owner in regard to the safety of an adjacent public roadway, particularly in relation to negligent third-party drivers. The unfortunate incident involved a nurse who was hit and fatally injured by such a driver while crossing the public street adjacent to the hospital she worked in. \n\nThe trial court and court of appeals had previously determined that the hospital had a unique, case-specific duty to the nurse due to the particular layout of its parking lot and exit, which ostensibly created a scenario where injuries to others were foreseeable. However, this case examines whether the assignment of such specific duties is warranted when established duty rules are applicable to the given factual situation.\n\nAccording to the established duty rules, the hospital, as the occupier of the premises, had a limited duty based on its control over certain sections of the adjoining public right-of-way. However, there was no evidence indicating that any hazardous condition within the hospital's control in the public right-of-way was the cause of the nurse's injuries. As a result, the court reversed the previous judgment and rendered a take-nothing judgment.\n\nThe background of the case is as follows:\n\nThe defendant, HNMC, owns and operates a hospital and a fenced parking lot situated in Northwest Houston. The hospital lot and premises are separated by Cali Drive, a North-South street that is owned and maintained by Harris County. The county\u2019s right-of-way for Cali Drive extends beyond both sides of the street, incorporating the curb, grass medians, and sidewalks.\n\nThe hospital has an exit that opens onto a staircase leading down to the sidewalk adjacent to Cali Drive, situated in the middle of the block. HNMC constructed a concrete pad near the bottom of the stairs, within the boundary of the county right-of-way, positioned between the sidewalk and the street. This pad is located across from the driveway that vehicles use to enter and exit the parking lot. Interestingly, the hospital exit and parking lot driveway do not perfectly align, with the driveway being a few feet north of the hospital exit. HNMC had also placed traffic control signs in the county right-of-way to the north of the driveway.\n\nThere are crosswalks at each end of the block, which link the hospital and the parking lot. However, instead of using these crosswalks, many patients, visitors, and employees who leave the hospital at this exit simply cross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, entering the lot through the driveway. A crosswalk existed in the middle of the block until 2011, but it was abandoned, and over time, its markings faded. \n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, several vehicular accidents involving pedestrians occurred on Cali Drive. Concerned, HNMC wrote to the county in 2009, requesting the implementation of new safety measures on Cali Drive. The county conducted a traffic study, introduced some safety measures, and recommended additional safety measures for HNMC to implement. HNMC, however, did not implement these recommendations.\n\nIn 2015, after HNMC's refusal to implement the recommended safety measures and after the markings of the abandoned crosswalk had mostly faded, Leny Chan, an HNMC employee for over 30 years, was tragically killed while crossing Cali Drive. She was leaving work and heading to her car in the HNMC parking lot. She exited the hospital and began to cross Cali Drive in the middle of the block, aiming to enter the parking lot via the driveway.\n\nSimultaneously, James Budd was beginning to exit the parking lot in his vehicle. He pulled up past the traffic control signage situated in the right-of-way on his right and stopped at the driveway. He looked both ways before deciding to turn left out of the parking lot to proceed south on Cali Drive. Tragically, he hit Chan while making the left turn. Emergency measures were promptly taken, but Chan did not survive.", "The citation refers to the appeal case number 22-2089, submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, Mitchellville Plaza Bar LP, against the defendant, The Hanover American Insurance Company. This case is conducted in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and was initially presented in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, at Greenbelt, presided over by Paul W. Grimm, Senior District Judge. \n\nMitchellville Plaza Bar LP appeals against the district court's judgment which favored Hanover American Insurance Company's cross-motion for summary judgment on Mitchellville\u2019s claims of breach of contract and bad faith emerging from an insurance dispute. Mitchellville had claimed that Hanover wrongly rejected coverage under its insurance policy for property damage inflicted by turkey vultures to the rooftop of one of Mitchellville\u2019s properties. However, Hanover dismissed coverage based on a clause in the insurance policy which excluded coverage for damage created by an \u201cinfestation\u201d of birds. This appeal aims to challenge this decision.\n\nThe district court's granting of summary judgment is subject to de novo review, considering the facts in a manner most favorable to the non-moving party. The summary judgment is correctly awarded only when the movant demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute over any material fact and that the movant is rightfully entitled to judgment as per the law.\n\nThe appeal acknowledges that the only disputed issue in its breach of contract claim is whether or not the \u201cinfestation\u201d policy exception is applicable to its claim. Under Pennsylvania law, contractual interpretation issues are considered questions of law. The paramount goal of contract interpretation is to decipher the intent of the contracting parties. If the contract language is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the parties is to be discerned from the document itself. In such instances, the contract\u2019s language is given its commonly accepted and plain meaning. However, when ambiguity exists, parol evidence is acceptable to explain, clarify, or resolve the ambiguity. In the event of unambiguous contracts, the court interprets them as a matter of law, however, when ambiguity arises, the resolution is typically left to the jury.\n\nThe appellant's lawyers are Brian S. Goodman from Goodman & Donohue, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland. The appellee is represented by Margaret Fonshell Ward from Downs Ward Bender Herzog & Kintigh, P.A., Hunt Valley, Maryland. The circuit judges in this case are AGEE, QUATTLEBAUM, and RUSHING.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal by Mitchellville against the district court's verdict favoring Hanover's cross-motion for summary judgment is affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The court concurs with the district court's interpretation of the \u201cinfestation\u201d clause in the insurance policy, which led to the denial of coverage for the damage caused by turkey vultures to Mitchellville\u2019s property.

The appeal originated from the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in Greensboro, overseen by Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld. The case, marked as 1:20-cv-00134-LPA, was argued on September 19, 2023, and decided on January 19, 2024. \n\nThe presiding judges for this appeal were Circuit Judges Harris and Quattlebaum, and Senior Circuit Judge Keenan. The decision resulted in the case being vacated and remanded with instructions, as per the unpublished per curiam opinion. The appellant was represented by Luke Charles Lirot from Luke Lirot, P.A., Clearwater, Florida, and Michael Strickland from Michael W. Strickland and Assoc., Raleigh, North Carolina. The appellee was represented by Gilda Adriana Hernandez and Charlotte C. Smith from Law Offices of Gilda A. Hernandez, PLLC, Cary, North Carolina. \n\nThe crux of this case revolves around a motion to compel arbitration in a putative class action. The central point of contention is whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an entity could prove it was the corporate employer who had entered into an arbitration agreement with its employee. The supposed agreement demanded, among other things, that the employee be obliged to submit to arbitration any wage-related claims against the employer. The district court ruled that the entity failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish an enforceable arbitration agreement. \n\nAfter a comprehensive review of the records, the order of the district court was vacated. It was concluded that in accordance with Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the court should have conducted a trial to resolve whether the parties had entered into an enforceable arbitration agreement. \n\nThe initial complaint was filed by Siobhan James, asserting a putative class action against her \u201cemployer,\u201d \u201cPRS Partners, LLC, d/b/a Capital Cabaret\u201d (PRS). James claimed that she worked as an \u201cexotic dancer\u201d at PRS\u2019s \u201cCapital Cabaret Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Morrisville, North Carolina,\u201d and that PRS violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (the FLSA) and the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act by failing to compensate its dancers as required by these laws. \n\nJames also filed a motion for conditional certification of a proposed class, specifically, all exotic dancers who had worked at \u201cDefendant\u2019s Capital Cabaret\u201d gentlemen\u2019s club for the last several years prior to filing the lawsuit. \n\nIn response, PRS filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that James\u2019s claims were subject to arbitration in accordance with an agreement between the parties. To support its motion, PRS submitted three exhibits: (1) a copy of James\u2019s United States passport; (2) a three-page, signed arbitration agreement (the alleged agreement); and (3) a second set of \u201csignatures\u201d on a separate page that referred to an \u201cEntertainer Orientation Packet.\u201d\n\nThe arbitration agreement states that it was made \u201cby and between\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d and the \u201cEntertainer,\u201d which are identified in the agreement in handwriting as \u201cCap Cab\u201d and \u201cS.

USA v. MARTREY ANTWAIN NEWBY, a/k/a Trey, Appeal Number: 21-4018, Document Number: 49, Filed: January 19, 2024. \n\nThe appeal case of Martrey Antwain Newby, also known as Trey, against the United States of America was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit under appeal number 21-4018. The original case was heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, at Greenville, with presiding District Judge Louise W. Flanagan. \n\nThe court's decision was made on January 19, 2024, following arguments presented on September 22, 2023. The panel of judges included Wynn, Quattlebaum, and Heytens. The sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing as per the published opinion written by Judge Heytens and joined by Judge Wynn. However, Judge Quattlebaum wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\nThe appellant, Martrey Antwain Newby, was represented by Eric Joseph Brignac of the Office of the Federal Public Defender in Raleigh, North Carolina, with additional briefing by G. Alan DuBois, Federal Public Defender. The appellee, the United States of America, was represented by Kevin James Barber of the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. Additional briefings for the appellee were provided by Kenneth A. Polite Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Lisa H. Miller, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Joel S. Johnson from the Appellate Section, Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.; as well as G. Norman Acker III, Acting United States Attorney, and David A. Bragdon, Assistant United States Attorney from the Office of the United States Attorney, Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThe appellant, Martrey Newby, has been incarcerated for over ten years, with a scheduled release date in 2028. In the initial sentencing, the district court included discretionary conditions of supervised release in its written judgment that were not orally announced during the court proceedings. This was identified as an error in line with the United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020) case. \n\nSubsequently, the district court modified Newby\u2019s sentence under the purview of the First Step Act of 2018, and the court\u2019s amended judgment claimed to carry forward those same conditions. The appellant has since appealed this judgment, requesting the Court to remand for another round of sentencing. \n\nThe court concluded that Newby\u2019s challenges are properly before them, given the specific context of this case. On evaluating the merits of the appeal, the court decided to vacate Newby\u2019s sentence and remand the case for a full resentencing.\n\nOn the initial trial in 2008, Newby was convicted of six non-violent drug offenses. The sentence included a 425-month incarceration period and a 10-year term of supervised release. \n\nDuring the post-trial sentencing hearing, the district court announced various discretionary conditions of supervised release. However, its written judgment added several more such conditions. Newby appealed this sentence on unrelated grounds, which were rejected in an unpublished per curiam opinion. See United States v. Newby, 403 Fed. Appx. 809 (4th Cir. 2010).\n\nAlmost a decade later, Newby filed a pro se motion seeking a sentence reduction under the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5222. The district court assigned counsel and ordered a revised presentence investigation report.\n\nNewby objected to the new report\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, identifying an error in how the original judgment described one of his offenses of conviction. The district court concluded the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d was to correct the clerical error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. After doing so, the court\u2014applying the First Step Act\u2014adjusted Newby\u2019s Guidelines range and reduced his sentence to 294 months in prison and four years of supervised release. The court\u2019s resentencing order concluded: \u201cExcept as expressly modified herein, the amended judgment carries forward all terms of \u201d the previous one. The amended judgment contains the same discretionary conditions of supervised release.", "The unpublished appeal numbered 23-4338 was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with the United States of America as the plaintiff-appellee and Montello Marquette Hood as the defendant-appellant. The appeal was lodged from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, at Rock Hill, under the senior district judge, Joseph F. Anderson, Jr. The case was submitted on January 4, 2024, and decided on January 19, 2024, with Judges Wilkinson, King, and Agee reviewing the case.\n\nThe appeal pertains to the district court's judgment which revoked the defendant's supervised release and sentenced him to the time served. The defendant appealed this decision. However, the Court of Appeals did not find any reversible error, hence the district court's judgment was affirmed.\n\nThe district court may revoke a defendant's supervised release based on a preponderance of the evidence indicating a violation of supervised release, as per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The Court of Appeals reviews the factual findings of the district court underlying a revocation of supervised release for clear errors and the final decision to revoke the supervised release for abuse of discretion, following the case United States v. Cohen, 63 F.4th 250, 254, cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 165 (2023). When revoking supervised release, the district court needs to substantiate the evidence it relied upon for the Court of Appeals to understand the reasons behind the revocation, as per United States v. Patterson, 957 F.3d 426, 434 (4th Cir. 2020). A written decision is not necessary, provided that the transcript and record are sufficiently comprehensive for the reviewing court to understand the basis of the trial court's decision.\n\nThe defendant claimed that the district court's factual findings were not substantial enough for a meaningful appellate review. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the court's ruling might not have been precisely articulated, it deemed the ruling sufficient for their review. The Court of Appeals identified two possible interpretations of the district court's ruling: first, that the court might have considered the two assessments at Catawba Area Mental Health Center as one incident, referring to this and the defendant's failure to attend an appointment at Three Trees Center for Change; second, the court might have disregarded the Three Trees incident and considered solely the two Catawba assessments. Given that these incidents occurred close in time and were discussed at the two hearings, the Court of Appeals deemed the record adequate for review.\n\nThe defendant also claimed, based on the Cohen case, that the district court erred in revoking his supervised release, arguing that he did not fail to participate in treatment and that the court improperly equated participation with perfect compliance. The Cohen case held that a district court committing an error in finding that the defendant violated the condition requiring him to participate in a sex offender treatment program by not following the rules of that program. The Court of Appeals recognized that noncompliance with rules could eventually preclude further participation but emphasized that the treatment provider did not consider rule breaches as equivalent to non-participation, as per Cohen, 63 F.4th at 254.", "CITATION:\n\nTHE THIRTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS\nCase Number: 13-23-00209-CR\n\nArmando Gomez alternatively known as Armando Gamez Jr., Armando Gomez Jr., and Armando Cisneros Gomez Jr.\n                                                                               Versus\nThe State of Texas\n\nThe case was on appeal from the 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas with the trial court cause number as 2022-DCR-0903.\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nFollowing deliberation on the appeal, THE THIRTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS arrived at the conclusion that the verdict of the lower court stands justified and as such, is to be upheld. \n\nIn accordance with this judgment, the decision of the lower court is hereby AFFIRMED. \n\nThe court further instructs that this decision be certified to the court of first instance for compliance. \n\nThe above verdict was delivered on the 18th day of January, 2024.", "CITATION: NUMBER 13-23-00209-CR, COURT OF APPEALS, THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG. \n\nPARTIES: \n\nAppellant: ARMANDO GOMEZ, also known as ARMANDO GAMEZ JR., ARMANDO GOMEZ JR., and ARMANDO CISNEROS GOMEZ JR. \n\nAppellee: THE STATE OF TEXAS.\n\nThis case was on appeal from the 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas.\n\nOPINION: \n\nThe judgment was delivered by Chief Justice Contreras, alongside Justices Benavides and Tijerina, of the Thirteenth District Court of Texas.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND: \n\nThe appellant, Armando Gomez, was convicted for the possession of a controlled substance in the amount of 400 grams or more, categorized as a first-degree felony under the Texas Penal Code, Section 481.115(f). The jury concluded the trial by sentencing Gomez to twenty-five years of imprisonment. The only contention of Gomez on appeal was that the trial court mistakenly admitted the testimony of law enforcement officers who were not wearing body cameras as required under Texas Occupation Code Section 1701.655. The decision of the lower court was affirmed in this appeal.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, Officer Joel Padilla of the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office Special Investigations Unit, was informed of a vehicle possibly containing narcotics en route to his location. He was also provided a description of the vehicle. He pulled over by the expressway to wait for the said vehicle. About thirty minutes later, a vehicle matching the provided description appeared, which was later discovered to be owned by Gomez. Officer Padilla followed the vehicle, observed Gomez weaving unsafely through traffic and noticed a broken brake light on his vehicle. Consequently, Officer Padilla pulled Gomez over. \n\nAfter explaining the traffic violations to Gomez, Officer Padilla asked him if there were any narcotics present in the vehicle. Gomez's response was negative. However, he agreed to Officer Padilla's request for a vehicle search and signed a waiver form to that effect. The waiver form was later submitted as evidence.\n\nShortly after the traffic stop began, Deputy Angel Perez arrived at the scene with a drug-sniffing dog. The dog signaled a positive alert towards the front seat and the dashboard of the vehicle. Both Officer Padilla and Deputy Perez testified to noticing mismatched screws and some loose screws on the dashboard. Upon removing the dashboard, they discovered a hidden package of cocaine. Gomez was subsequently arrested and taken to the Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDeputy Carlos Martinez interviewed Gomez at the sheriff's office where he read him his Miranda rights. Gomez signed a waiver form reiterating these rights. He subsequently confessed to intending to transport the cocaine to Louisiana for sale. Deputy Martinez compiled Gomez\u2019s confession into a written document and had Gomez review and sign it.\n\nGomez sought to suppress the statement he made to Deputy Martinez. His defense during the pretrial hearing was that his statement was not voluntary as his signature on the Miranda waiver appeared different from his signature on the confession. The trial court rejected the motion to suppress. Both the Miranda waiver and Gomez\u2019s written confession were admitted into evidence. During cross-examination, Gomez's counsel asked Deputy Martinez about the disparity in Gomez's signatures on the documents. Deputy Martinez affirmed that he personally witnessed Gomez sign both documents.\n\nAfter deliberation, the jury found Gomez guilty and sentenced him to twenty-five years of imprisonment.\n\nISSUES RAISED:\n\nIn his only contention on appeal, Gomez argued that the trial court erroneously admitted the officers\u2019 testimonies given that they were not equipped with body-worn cameras as mandated by Texas Occupation Code Section 1701.655. This section requires that any law enforcement agency receiving a grant for body-worn cameras or operating a body-worn camera program should adopt a policy for the use of such cameras. Gomez maintained that the officers' non-compliance with Section 1701.655 called into question the reliability of the evidence submitted, causing a structural error that rendered a fair trial unattainable and violated his right to a fair trial.", "Case Appeal Number: 13-22-00289-CV\n\nAppellate Court: Thirteenth District Court of Appeals, Texas, Corpus Christi \u2013 Edinburg\n\nAppellants: Blaine Crews and Hannah Crews\n\nAppellees: Richard Galvan and Sonia Galvan\n\nThe appeal originated from the 445th District Court of Cameron County, Texas.\n\nOpinion of the Court: \nThe opinion was delivered by Justice Benavides with Justices Longoria and Tijerina sitting on the bench.\n\nThe appellants, Blaine Crews and Hannah Crews, are contesting the decision of the trial court. They argue that the court erred in granting summary judgment and not adhering to its own scheduling order when deliberating on the merits of the Galvans\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.\n\nBackground of the Case:\n\nThe focus of this case and appeal is the legal doctrine of res judicata. Therefore, there are two proceedings to consider in our analysis. Firstly, the original case was filed on November 5, 2018, by the Galvans against the Crewses, with the trial court cause number 2018-DCL-06387-I. The Galvans sued the Crewses for assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation per se and public disclosure of private facts. On December 12, 2018, the Crewses motioned to dismiss the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). This motion was initially rejected by the trial court, but this decision was later reversed by the appellate court.\n\nFollowing this, the Crewses filed a counterpetition on April 17, 2020, alleging that the Galvans had intentionally inflicted emotional distress and conducted malicious civil prosecution. The Crewses claimed that the Galvans' insistence on pursuing a groundless defamation claim resulted in damages. The Galvans, in response, moved on several occasions to nonsuit their claims without prejudice. In a later hearing, they verbally amended these motions to be with prejudice.\n\nOn April 28, 2020, the trial court approved an order dismissing all of the Galvans\u2019 claims, excluding their defamation claim, with prejudice. Subsequently, on June 9, 2020, the trial court approved an order dismissing the Galvans\u2019 defamation claim with prejudice and awarded the Crewses attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and sanctions. On October 27, 2020, the trial court issued a clarification order, recognizing that the Galvans\u2019 non-suiting of their claims barred the Crewses\u2019 counterclaims. The Crewses filed a new trial motion on November 25, 2020, arguing that the Galvans\u2019 nonsuit of their claims did not affect the Crewses\u2019 right to affirmative relief. However, the trial court denied this motion in a written order on January 26, 2021.\n\nThe proceeding leading to this appeal began when the Crewses filed an original petition in the trial court cause number 2020-DCL-05323-I on October 30, 2020, in which they reiterated the same causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious civil prosecution as in the initial proceeding. In response, the Galvans filed an amended answer on February 5, 2021, which posited the affirmative defense of res judicata and sought sanctions against the Crewses for filing a frivolous lawsuit.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Galvans moved for summary judgment on their affirmative defense of res judicata. They argued that the trial court's order dated October 27, 2020, represented a prior final judgment on the merits by a competent court, and that the identity of the parties involved, as well as the claims asserted by the Crewses in the current proceeding, were identical to those in the prior proceeding. In contrast, the Crewses countered that their previously filed counterclaims in the first proceeding had not been adjudicated and thus, res judicata was inapplicable.", "Citation: \n\nThirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas.

The case revolved around Murray's claims for a declaratory judgment and equitable reimbursement on a jointly owned property. \n\nThe trial court declared that Robinson was not liable for the property's taxes, mortgage payments, or costs related to maintenance, repair, and improvement incurred by Murray. However, it was established that Robinson was responsible for half of the insurance premiums paid for the structures on the property. \n\nMurray presented three issues for the court's consideration, which were reframed and construed as two issues. The primary issues of contention were: (1) the trial court\u2019s error in not granting judgment in Murray's favor, and (2) the trial court\u2019s decision to issue declarations not backed by the pleadings. The court of appeals upheld the judgment of the trial court, affirming its previous decision.\n\nCase Details:\n\nMurray and his wife, Florentina Murray, owned around seventy-eight acres of property in Travis County, Texas, which made up their homestead. After Florentina's death in 1997, Robinson, Florentina's only child from a prior marriage, filed an affidavit of heirship declaring her interest in the property according to Texas's intestate succession laws (TEX. EST. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 102.003, 201.003(c)).\n\nFollowing Florentina's death, Murray continued to claim the property as his homestead and resided there, while Robinson lived elsewhere. In 2019, Murray sued Robinson, demanding contribution and reimbursement, foreclosure of an equitable lien, and a declaratory judgment. Murray asserted that as a joint owner, Robinson should be liable for fifty percent of the sums he paid for taxes, insurance, and repairs for the property. \n\nAt the bench trial, Murray testified that there was no probate administration for Florentina's estate. He also pointed out that upon her death, Florentina owed approximately $300,000 in debts, which did not include any lien on the property. Following Florentina's passing, Murray secured two loans on the property\u2014$238,477.50 in 1998 and $410,000 in 2001. He maintained that the proceeds from these loans were largely used to settle Florentina's debts. However, Murray did not present any documentary evidence that would support his claim.\n\nMurray sought reimbursement from Robinson for the principal and interest paid toward $300,000 of the 2001 loan, totaling approximately $611,000 at the time of trial. He also demanded Robinson pay her share of the homeowner's insurance, totaling $55,021.25, which constituted sixty-seven percent of the total costs, as that portion was allocated towards insuring the property's structures. Murray testified that he had paid a total of $335,997 in property taxes from 1998 to the time of trial, and of those taxes, $7,277.47 was for the year 1997, which he paid in 1998.\n\nIn summary, the crux of Murray's reimbursement claim against Robinson was to cover half of the expenses he had incurred in maintaining the property, including property taxes, insurance, and repairs, as well as principal and interest paid on a mortgage taken out on the property after Florentina's death. This case, therefore, was an exploration of the rights and responsibilities of joint ownership of property under the law.\n", "This legal document cites the appeal case of Daniel Garcia against The State of Texas as the appellant and appellee, respectively. The case, referenced as NUMBER 13-22-00303-CR, was taken before the Thirteenth District Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi - Edinburg, from the 24th District Court of DeWitt County, Texas.\n\nThe appellant, Daniel Garcia, is challenging his convictions for assault on a public servant and retaliation, both classified as third-degree felonies, which have been further augmented due to his prior felony convictions under the Texas Penal Code's sections 22.01 and 36.06, as well as 12.42(d). Garcia raised five issues in his appeal, questioning the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions; the trial court's denial of his motion to strike four juror candidates for cause; the refusal by the trial court to declare a mistrial after the jury breached its instructions; and the judgment's nullity due to inconsistency with the sentence determined by the trial court. While the court affirmed the convictions, some modifications were made.\n\nThe background of the case shows that Garcia was indicted on a single count each of public servant assault and retaliation. Despite entering a plea of not guilty, the case proceeded to trial. At trial, the appellant's sister, Oralia Garcia, testified that she had called the police in the early morning hours of July 24, 2020, after her brother arrived at her doorstep around 2 to 3 a.m. in a barefoot and shirtless state, refusing to vacate the premises. \n\nOralia detailed the unfolding of the events, stating that after offering her brother a drink, he threw a planter towards her. She swiftly closed the front door to evade being struck by the planter and called the police after her brother refused to leave and kept knocking on the door. Oralia further clarified that her brother lived in a small trailer on her property and that she was his financial supporter. While it was common for him to demand food or drink from her, his aggressive behavior on the aforementioned evening was unprecedented.\n\nDeWitt County Sheriff's Officer Juan Julian Ruiz Jr., who responded to Oralia's call, testified that he found Garcia sitting on the porch swing, half-naked and with only one shoe on. According to Deputy Ruiz, Garcia appeared to be under the influence of narcotics or alcohol and threatened him. Despite being instructed to leave the premises or face arrest, Garcia refused. Garcia then progressed towards Deputy Ruiz and verbally assaulted him. The deputy informed Garcia that he would be handcuffed, which resulted in Garcia resisting and physically assaulting Deputy Ruiz, who then called for backup.", "Citation: \n\nAppeals Court Thirteenth, Case No. 13-22-00303-CR, Daniel Garcia against The State of Texas.

HB1 ALTERNATIVE HOLDINGS, LLC, Appellee. On appeal from County Court at Law No. 5 of Nueces County, Texas. \n\nIn this memorandum opinion, Chief Justice Contreras and Justices Benavides and Tijerina presided. Appellant Glenn Edward Steed raised an objection to the trial court\u2019s final judgment of possession awarded to appellee HB1 Alternative Holdings, LLC (HB1) under the Texas Property Code Ann. \u00a7 24.002. The two issues Steed presented were: (1) the trial court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the dispute over the title to the subject property, and (2) the alleged error by the trial court because of a previously obtained temporary restraining order (TRO), which Steed argued should have \"barred\" the foreclosure sale of the subject property. The court affirmed the judgment.\n\nJanet Steed, the appellant\u2019s mother, was the sole owner of the property located on Dorsal Street in Corpus Christi, Texas. On March 23, 2012, she entered into a home equity conversion mortgage, also called a reverse mortgage, on the home. This included a note of $495,000 and an \"Adjustable Rate Home Equity Conversion Deed of Trust.\" The deed of trust named \"Janet K. Steed\" as the \"Borrower,\" the property in question as \"the Property,\" and Generation Mortgage Company, the successor in interest to Nationstar Mortgage LLC, d/b/a Champion Mortgage Company (Champion), as \"Lender.\" \n\nThe deed of trust clearly stated the agreement between the lender and the borrower that the lender would have a fully enforceable lien on the property, and that in cases of default, foreclosure under a power of sale would be pursued. If the property were sold under these circumstances, the borrower or any person holding possession of the property through the borrower would be expected to immediately surrender possession of the property to the purchaser.\n\nJanet defaulted on the loan before her death in 2018. On September 12, 2018, Champion sent a notice of default to Janet\u2019s estate. In February 2019, after the default was never cured, Champion filed a lawsuit against Janet\u2019s heirs, including Steed, to foreclose on the property. On July 15, 2020, Champion obtained a final judgment allowing foreclosure. However, Steed managed to secure a TRO, effective August 31, 2021, which halted the foreclosure sale.\n\nDespite the TRO, the mortgage remained in default. The district court, in the proceeding in which the TRO was issued, entered an agreed judgment on April 11, 2022, dismissing Steed\u2019s claim against Champion and allowing Champion to proceed with foreclosure. Consequently, HB1 purchased the property during the foreclosure sale on August 2, 2022. \n\nHB1 filed a forcible-detainer action in justice court seeking immediate possession of the property in September 2022, and an eviction notice was given to Steed. Steed did not appear in court, leading to a default judgment of eviction in favor of HB1.\n\nSteed appealed the default judgment, and a de novo bench trial was held in the county court on November 14, 2022. Steed argued that the TRO issued in August 2021 should have prevented the foreclosure sale, that he had no knowledge of or consent to the agreed judgment in his district court case against Champion, and that he was not notified of the subsequent foreclosure sale on August 2, 2022. \n\nAt the trial, Steed revealed that the property was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. He testified that Janet had submitted an insurance claim but faced delays in its processing. Steed also claimed he was living in the property and repairing it at the time of the eviction notice. The court, however, did not find these arguments persuasive. The trial court held that Steed was not a party to the reverse mortgage and did not have an enforceable interest in the property. It also found that the TRO had no effect on the foreclosure sale as it had been dismissed in the agreed judgment.\n\nFurther, the court found no merit in Steed's claim that he was not notified of the foreclosure sale. It held that Steed's admission that he was living in the property at the time of the eviction notice implied he was likely to have received notice about the foreclosure sale. Hence, the trial court affirmed the default judgment of eviction in favor of HB1.\n\nThis decision underscores the importance of understanding and complying with the conditions of a reverse mortgage, including the requirement to surrender possession of the property following foreclosure. Furthermore, it highlights the limited nature of TROs and their inability to indefinitely prevent a foreclosure, especially when the underlying mortgage remains in default.", "CITATION:\n\nCourt of Appeals, Thirteenth District\n\nCase Number: 13-22-00595-CV\n\nGlenn Edward Steed, Appellant\nv.\nHB1 Alternative Holdings, LLC, Appellee\n\nThis appeal arises from the County Court at Law No. 5 of Nueces County, Texas\nInitial Trial Court Cause No. 2022-CCV-61269-5\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nThe Court of Appeals, Thirteenth District, having duly deliberated on this matter, hereby ascertains that the original judgment rendered by the trial court is to be sustained.

The affirmation of the trial court's judgment upholds the integrity of the judicial process and serves as a reminder of the importance of thorough judicial review in ensuring justice.", "In the Court of Appeals, Thirteenth District of Texas, Corpus Christi \u2013 Edinburg, Case Number 13-24-00043-CV, titled In Re Shannon Moczygemba, sought to address a petition for Writ of Mandamus filed by Shannon Moczygemba on the 17th of January, 2024. \n\nIn this petition, Shannon Moczygemba claims that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to set aside a mediated settlement agreement and by refusing to set a hearing on a motion to declare the agreement unenforceable (as per Texas Family Code Annotated sections 6.602, 153.0071). Concurrently, she also filed an emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings, inclusive of the final hearing that was scheduled for January 18, 2024. This move was made pending the resolution of her petition for writ of mandamus (as per Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10).\n\nThe writ of mandamus is viewed as an extraordinary and discretionary remedy as observed in previous cases like In re Allstate Indemnity Co., In re Garza, and In re Prudential Insurance Company of America. The relator, in this case, Shannon Moczygemba, carries the onus of demonstrating two key points: one, that the trial court abused its discretion and second, that she is left without an adequate remedy by appeal (as referenced in In re USAA General Indemnity Co., In re Prudential Insurance Company of America, and Walker v. Packer).\n\nUpon thorough examination and full consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus and all relevant law, the Court concluded that Shannon Moczygemba did not successfully meet the burden of proof necessary to obtain relief. Consequently, the Court denied the petition for writ of mandamus without prejudice. Furthermore, her emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings was also denied by the Court. \n\nThe presiding Justice for the case was Nora L. Longoria who delivered and filed the Memorandum Opinion on the 18th of January, 2024.", "In the appellate case numbered 13-23-00531-CR, brought forth by Jennifer Lopez against The State of Texas, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has rendered its judgment. This appeal was made from the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas under the trial court cause number A-23-5138-CR.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has determined that the appeal is to be dismissed. The Court has ordered the dismissal in accordance with the detailed reasoning provided in its official opinion. \n\nMoreover, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has commanded that this decision be certified and forwarded to the lower court for adherence and implementation. This judgment was issued on January 18, 2024.\n\nThe roles of appellate courts are crucial in the justice system, as they provide an avenue for parties to challenge and seek redress for legal decisions they believe are erroneous. The appellate courts oversee the trial courts and ensure that they are conducting fair and just proceedings, and that legal decisions comply with the relevant laws and case precedents.\n\nIn this case, though the appellant, Jennifer Lopez, contested the decision of the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals saw no legal error in the lower court's judgment, culminating to the dismissal of the appeal.\n\nThe dismissal of an appeal can occur for a variety of reasons, such as the appellant's failure to present compelling arguments, procedural errors, absence of legal merit in the appeal, or if the appellant fails to comply with the rules of the court. However, the specific reasons for the dismissal of this appeal can only be identified by examining the court\u2019s opinion, which includes the legal reasoning and the analysis of the issues raised in the appeal.\n\nConsequently, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals' decision to dismiss the appeal and the directive for the lower court's observance of this decision signifies the Court's affirmation of the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas' judgment. This effectively concludes the appellate process for Jennifer Lopez in this matter, against The State of Texas, unless further appeal avenues, such as the Supreme court, are explored.\n\nThis case exemplifies the intricate workings of the justice system, where decisions made at lower courts can be appealed at higher courts for review. However, the appellate courts' power is not absolute and is anchored on legal principles, procedural rules, and the strength of the arguments presented. The appellate courts are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is appropriately served. In instances where they find that lower courts have acted in accordance with these principles, as demonstrated in the current case, they affirm the rulings, thereby reinforcing the credibility of the justice system. The certification and enforcement of their decisions by the lower courts further underscores the hierarchical nature of the court system.\n\nThe date of the judgment, January 18, 2024, indicates the timeline within which the involved parties must react. Depending on the specific court rules and the nature of the judgment, the parties may have a designated period within which to seek further redress if they are discontented with the appellate court\u2019s decision.", "Case Reference: NUMBER 13-23-00531-CR\n\nJudicial Authority: COURT OF APPEALS, THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI \u2013 EDINBURG\n\nParties Involved: JENNIFER LOPEZ, Appellant, versus THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee.\n\nOrigin of Appeal: On appeal from the 36th District Court of Aransas County, Texas.\n\nCase Review Memorandum: Considered by Chief Justice Contreras and Justices Benavides and Tijerina, the Memorandum Opinion was given by Justice Tijerina.\n\nCase Overview: The appellant lodged a notice of appeal, aiming to contest a ruling in the trial court case number A-23-5138-CR.

The appellants in this case are Jose A. Gonzalez and Teresa M. Gonzalez, with the respondents being Miguel A. Trevino and Angelica Trevino.\n\nJudgement:\n\nThe Thirteenth Court of Appeals, after careful consideration and review of this case, has decided that the appeal should be dismissed. This decision was reached based on the Court's evaluation of the legal arguments and evidence presented by both the appellants and respondents.\n\nIn line with this decision, the Court officially dismissed the appeal, as documented in its written opinion. The Court's opinion is the written explanation of the Court's decision, which takes into account the facts of the case, the relevant laws, and the legal principles applied in reaching the decision. The Court's opinion serves as the definitive record of the decision and provides the reasoning behind the dismissal of the appeal.\n\nFurthermore, the Court adjudged the costs of the appeal against the appellants, Jose A.

These costs can include filing fees, attorney's fees, and other expenses related to the preparation and presentation of the appeal. The adjudication of costs against the appellants serves as a legal sanction for the unsuccessful appeal and is intended to compensate the respondents for their expenses in defending against the appeal.\n\nCertification:\n\nThe Court further ordered that the decision be certified below for observance.

Judgment. \n\nThe Thirteenth Court of Appeals, upon considering the appeal, arrived at the conclusion that the appeal warrants dismissal. Acting as per their opinion, the Court directed the appeal to be dismissed. Appellant was subsequently adjudged the costs of the appeal. \n\nThe Court further ordains this decision to be certified below for observance. \n\nThe citation above pertains to the judgment delivered on January 18, 2024. \n\nAs this is a legal document, it is paramount to note that each court case and its subsequent proceedings are unique and treated on a case-by-case basis. The court's decision in this particular case is a result of the specific circumstances, facts, and legal arguments presented. It should not be misconstrued as a universally applicable precedent. The Thirteenth Court of Appeals, like all appellate courts, reviews the decisions of lower courts. In this case, it scrutinized the proceedings of the 92nd District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas. \n\nIn accordance with the court's procedure, the appellant (Mary Ashley Gomez) brought the case against the appellee (Juan Jose Rojas) to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals after an unsatisfactory ruling at the district court level. It is important to note that an appeal is not a retrial or a new trial of the case. The appellate courts do not usually consider new witnesses or new evidence. Appeals are based on arguments that there were legal errors in the trial or sentencing. \n\nThe Court, after reviewing the case, decided to dismiss the appeal. The reason for dismissal can vary significantly from case to case, and no specific reason for the dismissal is given in the citation above. However, appeals are frequently dismissed when the court concludes that no legal errors occurred in the lower court, when the appeal is considered frivolous, or when the appellant fails to follow legal procedures for the appeal. \n\nThe reference to costs adjudged against the appellant means that the appellant was ordered to pay for the costs associated with the appeal. These costs can include fees for filing the appeal, attorney's fees, and other court costs. This is a common practice in many legal systems and is meant to discourage frivolous appeals. \n\nFinally, the Court ordered this decision to be certified below for observance. This means the court's decision is sent to the lower court, informing it of the decision, and it should recognize and implement the court's decision. \n\nThe citation's final date, January 18, 2024, likely refers to the judgment date or the date when the court's decision was rendered. \n\nWhile interpreting the citation, it should be noted that this summary is an interpretation based on standard legal procedures and terminologies.

Consequently, the Court mandates to uphold the verdict passed by the trial court. \n\nThe financial burden associated with the appeal process is deemed to be borne by the appellant, Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr.\n\nIn addition, this court instructs that this ruling be duly acknowledged and enforced in the lower court.\n\nDate: January 18, 2024", "In the case of Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr. against Morgan Graham (Case Number: 13-23-00091-CV) in the Thirteenth District Court of Appeals in Texas, the appellant, Reynaldo Gonzalez Jr., contested the trial court's dismissal of his motion under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) to dismiss the claim of Morgan Graham, the appellee. Graham's claim was lodged under Section 253.131 of the Texas Election Code. \n\nThree issues were raised by Gonzalez, which were restructured for clarity. The first point for consideration was the standing of Graham to bring her claim. The second contention was the applicability of the TCPA to his claim and the failure of Graham to substantiate the claim with clear and precise evidence. The third argument claimed an infringement of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution if Graham's claim against him were to be allowed.\n\nThe history of the case is as follows: On December 13, 2021, Gonzalez submitted an application to contest Graham for the position of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. Incumbent County Chair Graham rejected Gonzalez's application on the grounds of incompleteness. Gonzalez sought a writ of mandamus requesting a review of Graham's decision. Upon review, it was found that Gonzalez's application did not meet the stipulated requirements of the election code, prompting Graham to reject it, barring Gonzalez from participating in the March 2022 Republican primary election, which Graham eventually won.\n\nOn August 2, 2022, Graham filed her original petition contending that Gonzalez failed to comply with Title 15 of the Texas Election Code. She claimed that Gonzalez did not appoint a campaign treasurer with the Texas Ethics Commission upon declaring his candidacy. She further alleged that Gonzalez received political contributions and authorized campaign expenditures without having an appointed campaign treasurer. Graham sought damages under Section 253.131 of the Texas Election Code as a result.\n\nIn response, Gonzalez filed a TCPA motion to dismiss on November 21, 2022, stating that Graham's claim was in response to his exercising his First Amendment rights to free speech, petition, and association. He also claimed that the suit was in reaction to activities protected by Section 27.010(b)(1) of the civil practice and remedies code.\n\nGonzalez also argued that Graham had no standing to bring her claim as she suffered no injury. He stated that Graham ran for county chair uncontested and did not have to spend any money to defeat her nonexistent political opponent. He stipulated that any injury suffered by Graham was a \u201csovereign injury\u201d rather than a \u201cproprietary injury,\u201d alleging that neither the Texas Election Code nor the Texas Constitution authorize private citizens to assert sovereign injuries. Gonzalez concluded that if Section 253.131 were to provide standing for politicians to sue their opponents, it should be deemed unconstitutional as applied to him since no civil damages for violations of campaign finance law can surpass the basic constitutional principle of standing. The court affirmed the decision.", "In the case under review by the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, identified as case number 13-23-00070-CR, the State of Texas versus Michael Anthony Vargas, emanated from the County Court at Law No. 5 of Cameron County, Texas under the trial court cause number 19-CCR-4564. \n\nAfter thoughtful consideration of the appeal, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals has arrived at the consensus that the appeal should be dismissed.

Both causes arose from the 94th District Court of Nueces County, Texas. This Court has interpreted Khnanisho's plea as a petition for writ of mandamus and a notice of appeal for our appellate cause number 13-23-00597-CV, in accordance with the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 19.1, 25.1, and 52. \n\nThe petition for writ of mandamus brought forth by Khnanisho includes allegations against the trial court judge, court staff, service of process, and debt collectors. \n\nIt is acknowledged that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary and discretionary remedy. The petitioner must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion and that the petitioner does not have an adequate remedy by appeal. Additionally, mandamus relief can be granted if a trial court issues an order \"beyond its jurisdiction,\" rendering the order void from the beginning.\n\nThe burden of proof lies with the petitioner to demonstrate eligibility for mandamus relief. The petitioner must provide a statement of facts supported by citations to \"competent evidence included in the appendix or record,\" and must present a clear and concise argument for the claims, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. The petitioner is also expected to provide a sufficient appendix or record to substantiate the mandamus relief claim. \n\nUpon thorough review and consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus and the relevant law, the Court believes that Khnanisho has not fulfilled his burden to obtain relief. Therefore, the petition for writ of mandamus is denied. Khnanisho's appeal remains under review in our appellate cause number 13-23-00597-CV. \n\nJustice: Clarissa Silva\n\nThe final verdict was rendered and recorded on January 19, 2024.\n", "In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, an individual case was brought to trial.

This letter was subsequently sent to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO/TXW).\n\nA paralegal at USAO/TXW was tasked with finding records related to Hernandez's request. She located 459 pages of documents that could be potentially responsive. This comprised 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of correspondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). After determining that the public records and grand jury transcripts were non-releasable, she dispatched the remaining pages to the EOUSA. These documents contained correspondence, attorney work product, and DEA documents. \n\nThe EOUSA then sent the 8 pages of DEA documents back to the DEA, leaving only 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work product. From these documents, the EOUSA deemed only 12 pages as responsive to Hernandez's request. \n\nOut of these 12 pages, the EOUSA fully released 4 pages, partially released 1 page, and fully withheld 7 pages based on FOIA exemptions. Hernandez then appealed the EOUSA\u2019s decision to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP), seeking production of all 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work product that had been located by the USAO/TXW. Despite receiving Hernandez's appeal, the OIP never notified him of any decision. \n\nIn response, Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, claiming a violation of the FOIA and the Privacy Act due to their failure to disclose the full extent of the records to which he was entitled. This led to cross-motions for summary judgment being filed by both parties. This court previously held that the withholding of the grand jury transcripts was appropriate, however, it was unclear whether the remaining 18 pages of correspondence and attorney work product were correctly withheld. As a result, the defendants were ordered to submit these documents for in camera review. \n\nHowever, rather than submitting the 18 pages for review, the EOUSA decided to release them to Hernandez. Upon attempting to release these documents, the EOUSA encountered a discrepancy. They could only find 15 pages that had been withheld due to non-responsiveness and could not locate the remaining 3 pages.", "In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, a case was underway between two parties: Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., who was the plaintiff, and the U.S. Department of Justice, among others, as the defendants. The case was numbered 15-CV-944 and was presided over by Judge Jia M. Cobb.\n\nIn the legal proceedings, both parties filed for summary judgment. A summary judgment is a definitive ruling by the judge that can end a civil case without a full trial. The defendants' motion for summary judgment was documented in ECF 35, while the plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment was in ECF 38.\n\nAfter meticulous examination of the case and consideration of the reasons elaborated in the accompanying memorandum opinion, the court made its final ruling. It is important to note that a memorandum opinion is a written explanation by the judge stating the reasons for the court's decision.\n\nIn accordance with the stated reasons in the memorandum opinion, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF 35). This effectively meant that the judge deemed the defendants' argument and evidence to be enough to rule in their favor without the need for a full trial. On the other hand, the plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment (ECF 38) was denied. The denial of the plaintiff's motion indicates that the court found their arguments and evidence insufficient to warrant a ruling in their favor without a complete trial.\n\nOnce the ruling was made, the court ordered the Clerk of the Court to terminate the case. The termination of the case signifies the end of all proceedings related to this particular matter in the District Court. The case cannot be revived or brought up again in the same court.\n\nThe order was marked as a final appealable order, which denotes that the order is the final decision from this court, but it can be appealed in a higher court. The parties involved in the case, if dissatisfied with the decision, have the right to request a higher court to review the judgment.\n\nThe final order was delivered and signed by United States District Judge Jia M. Cobb on January 19, 2024. The date of the order is crucial as it often determines the timeline for any potential appeals.\n\nIn summary, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr.'s cross-motion for summary judgment was denied, while the U.S. Department of Justice's motion for summary judgment was granted. The case was terminated with this final order, which could be appealed in a higher court. The order was delivered by Judge Jia M. Cobb on January 19, 2024.", "In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the pro se plaintiff Daniel Christmann lodged a case against the District of Columbia and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) in February 2022. He subsequently amended his complaint twice. The charges stem from perceived infringements of his rights in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, assault on the United States Capitol Building.\n\nThe plaintiff's claims, as detailed in his pro se second amended complaint, appear to allege violations of his Fourth Amendment rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He also implicates contraventions of the First Amendment Assemblies Act (FAAA), negligence pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 5-331.07(e)(1), and common law claims of \"malice interference\" and slander. Essentially, the plaintiff aims to deflect responsibility for his criminal behavior on January 6, 2021, onto the District's Mayor and USCP officers, among others. These officials were responsible for maintaining order and protecting the Capitol Building amid an unprecedented violent assault that threatened the safety of many, including the then Vice President of the United States.\n\nCurrently, there are two motions to dismiss the second amended complaint pending before the court. The District has filed one under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), while the USCP has lodged another under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). Alternatively, the USCP seeks a summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Both motions are granted for reasons explained herein.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges that he traveled to Washington, D.C., with a friend to participate in the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021. He departed the rally before former President Trump's speech ended and returned to his car. While in his vehicle in a parking garage, the plaintiff received a call from his brother, who informed him that \"people were just walking into the capitol building, and the police are not doing anything.\" \n\nMotivated by this call, the plaintiff then proceeded to the Capitol Building to \"news gather\" and arrived at approximately 2:48 PM. One minute later, he received an alert on his mobile phone regarding Mayor Bowser's curfew order, demanding everyone to be indoors by 6 PM. According to the plaintiff, everyone lost cellular service due to the mass text sent out simultaneously.\n\nThe plaintiff confesses that he ascended the stairs to the West Terrace to look for his friend and \"news gather\". He also admits to entering the Capitol Building at around 3:00 PM. He describes the scene, stating that many police officers were already present, observing as hordes of protestors flooded the premises. The plaintiff also confesses to entering a side room in an unsuccessful attempt to leave the building. He claims to have avoided any conflicts with the officers and spent a total of fewer than three minutes inside the building, solely filming the events.\n\nThe plaintiff admits to posting videos from the incident on Instagram and acknowledges the severity of the criminal behavior that transpired on the day at the Capitol. He mentions his fear that the government would treat him as a terrorist. The plaintiff does not disclose the date or location of his arrest in his pleadings, but he does describe it as a harsh experience, where he was hit hard in the face with a door.", "Citation: 11th Court of Appeals, Eastland, Texas. In Re: Steve Gerdes, No. 11-23-00283-CV, January 18, 2024. Memorandum Opinion by Chief Justice Bailey. Panel: Bailey, C.J., Trotter, J., Williams, J.\n\nThe court conducted a thorough examination of the records in this case, leading to the partial granting of the Relator\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus. In alignment with the court's decision, the petition for writ of mandamus is granted concerning the Ranger city commissioners and denied with respect to Judge David Hullum.\n\nThe Ranger city commissioners, respondents identified as Terry Robinson, Joe Sigler, Kevan Moize, Wendy Erwin, and Samantha McGinnis, are instructed to arrange a special election for the recall of commissioners Moize and McGinnis. This event should be scheduled within a timeframe of not less than fifteen days and not exceeding thirty days from the date of this decision.\n\nThis judgment reflects the court's careful consideration of the documented facts and circumstances of the case, demonstrating the judicial process's fairness and impartiality. It highlights the court's role in interpreting the law and ensuring that justice is served, even if it means overturning or modifying previous decisions.\n\nThe court's decision to grant the petition for writ of mandamus in part signifies the recognition of petitioner's rights under the law, while also underlining the court's commitment to upholding the principle of separation of powers. It underscores the court's authority and responsibility to ensure that government officials, such as the Ranger city commissioners, carry out their duties in accordance with the law.\n\nThe directive to the Ranger city commissioners to schedule a special election within a specified timeframe emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in governance. The recall of commissioners Moize and McGinnis represents the court's intervention to protect the public's right to elect their representatives.\n\nThe denial of the petition for writ of mandamus with respect to Judge David Hullum highlights the court's respect for the independence of the judiciary. It underscores the importance of judicial discretion and the need to avoid undue interference with the judicial process.\n\nIn conclusion, this judgment is a comprehensive interpretation of the law applied to the facts and circumstances of the case. It demonstrates the court's commitment to uphold justice, fairness, and the rule of law. In doing so, it reassures the public of the judiciary's role as the guardian of their rights and freedoms.", "In this mandamus proceeding initiated by Steve Gerdes, the Eleventh Court of Appeals No. 11-23-00283-CV dated January 18, 2024, has been asked to instruct the City of Ranger to arrange for a particular recall election for city commissioners Kevan Moize and Samantha McGinnis. Despite having received recall petitions with the requisite number of signatures over 150 days prior, the city did not take any measures to initiate an election. Consequently, we are partially granting the petition for mandamus and instructing the city commissioners to proceed with the recall election.\n\nThe participant of interest, Kevan Moize, contested in the mayoral elections for the City of Ranger in 2023 and was not victorious. Subsequently, he was appointed as a city commissioner for the post he currently serves. On the other hand, Samantha McGinnis, also a participant of interest and city commissioner, had an unopposed candidacy. The city commission annulled her election and without any votes in her favor, she was appointed as commissioner.\n\nOn August 11, 2023, Steve Gerdes, the petitioner, submitted two separate petitions to Somer Lee, the City Secretary of Ranger, seeking the recall of both Moize and McGinnis. Lee, in turn, forwarded the petitions to the commissioners on the same day. The city charter necessitates the commissioners to organize a recall election within a span of 15 to 30 days from the receipt of the petition. However, over five months have passed, and the city has not taken any steps to arrange a recall election.\n\nMandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is only applicable under certain circumstances (Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840, 1992). One of these circumstances includes compelling the enactment of any legal duty related to conducting an election (TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 273.061(a), 2023). Generally, mandamus is applicable where the duty to act is clear, and there is no disputed issue of fact (In re Suson, 120 S.W.3d 477, 478, 2003; Burns v. Kelly, 658 S.W.2d 731, 733, 1983; Blanchard v. Fulbright, 633 S.W.2d 617, 621, 1982). Thus, the key point of contention here is whether the city commissioners of Ranger, who are the respondents in this case, are under a distinct obligation to arrange for a recall election.\n\nThe commissioners contend that they are not obliged to schedule a recall election and provide two reasons for their inaction. Firstly, they claim that their obligation does not exist due to their solitary determination that the petitions are flawed. They indicate that the city charter requires one-fifth of the voters who sign the petition to certify that they voted for the concerned officer in their respective election (RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II, \u00a7 24). They argue that after examining the petitions, they concluded that neither meet the requisite certification threshold. Based on this examination, they have deduced that they are neither permitted nor required by the charter to initiate a recall. However, through this determination that neither Moize nor McGinnis qualifies and, by implication, cannot be valid candidates for recall, they have overstepped their authority.", "Citation: \n11th Court of Appeals, Eastland, Texas.

This appeal was from the 244th District Court in Ector County, Texas, under the trial court cause Nos. C-22-0520-CR and C-22-0521-CR.\n\nThe appellant, Isaac Jerald Jackson, was found guilty of aggravated robbery, classified as a first-degree felony, and unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon, a third-degree felony, under the Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.03 (West 2019) and \u00a7 46.04 (West Supp. 2023). The jury considered an enhancement allegation as true and decided on an eighty-year imprisonment sentence along with a $7,500 fine for the aggravated robbery offense. For the unlawful possession of a firearm offense, Jackson was given a ten-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine as per \u00a7 12.42(b) of the same Penal Code. The trial court passed the sentence in accordance with these decisions.\n\nJackson pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful firearm possession as a felon but declined guilt on the aggravated robbery charge. During the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, the State presented five witnesses, including Liying Chen, the owner of the Rose Garden Spa, where Jackson committed the alleged acts on March 21, 2022. Surveillance footage presented to the jury showed Jackson assaulting Chen while demanding money. The State also presented photographs of Chen's injuries, and testimony was given that Jackson's prints were found at the crime scene.\n\nJackson confessed to his state of mind being affected by Xanax during the incident and admitted to assaulting Chen, arguing he was trying to retrieve his money. Jackson was found guilty of both offenses. During the punishment phase, the State presented four witnesses, including two victims of a home burglary Jackson committed in 2012.

The court, thus, finds no basis for overturning or modifying the lower court's verdict.\n", "This legal opinion was delivered on January 18, 2024, from the Eleventh Court of Appeals, under case number 11-22-00282-CR. The case on appeal involves appellant, Rodolfo Sanchez, against the State of Texas.\n\nSanchez was initially charged with a third-degree felony for failing to comply with sex offender registration requirements as outlined in Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 62.051 (West Supp. 2023) and article 62.102 (West 2018). As part of a plea agreement on June 16, 2020, the trial court deferred a guilty verdict and instead assigned Sanchez to a five-year deferred adjudication community supervision program, which included adherence to all state and federal laws, court-directed meetings with a supervision officer, and a fine and court costs totaling $1,000.\n\nHowever, the State later submitted a motion to revoke Sanchez's community supervision and adjudicate his guilt, after evidence of his cocaine usage came to light. A hearing on this motion was held on October 10, 2022, during which Sanchez admitted to the drug use and requested the continuation of his community supervision. Despite this, the court established the truth of the State's motion and sentenced Sanchez to eight years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, effectively revoking his community supervision.\n\nSanchez's court-appointed counsel requested to withdraw from representing him in the appeal, citing no arguable issues for appeal after thoroughly examining both the record and applicable law. The counsel fulfilled all requirements by providing Sanchez with necessary documents and information regarding his rights as per Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); and Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\nAlthough given an extension, Sanchez did not present a pro se response to the counsel's Anders brief. Upon independent review of the record following Anders and Schulman procedures, the court agreed with the counsel's assessment that the appeal is meritless. The court noted that proof of a single violation is enough to support the revocation of a probationer's community supervision. In this case, Sanchez's admission of guilt was sufficient to uphold the court's decision. The court, therefore, concurred with the counsel that there were no arguable grounds for appeal.\n\nAs a result, the court granted the counsel's motion to withdraw and confirmed the trial court's ruling. This decision was delivered by Justice W. Stacy Trotter on January 18, 2024, and is not meant for publication as per Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 47.2(b).

Additionally, we overturn the trial court's judgment concerning Count Two and instead, issue a judgment of acquittal pertaining to this count. Conversely, regarding Count One and Count Three, we uphold the previous judgments made by the trial court.", "Case Overview:\n\nThe case in question involves the appellant, Rondale Gerrod Farris, and the appellee, the State of Texas. This appeal was lodged in the Eleventh Court of Appeals, under the case number 11-22-00086-CR, following the trial in the 358th District Court of Ector County, Texas, with case number D-18-2005-CR. \n\nThe appellant was initially indicted in 2018 and later re-indicted in 2021. The jury found the appellant guilty of murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal activity as per the crimes outlined in sections 19.02 and 71.02 of the Texas Penal Code (West Supplement, 2023). The consequent punishment was a 65-year, 50-year, and 20-year sentence in the Correctional Institutions Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, with sentences to be served concurrently.\n\nGrounds of Appeal:\n\nThe appellant raised four issues on appeal. Firstly, the appellant argued that the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution was violated due to convictions for both murder and felony murder. Secondly, the appellant disputed the sufficiency of evidence supporting the convictions for murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal activity. Thirdly, the appellant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Lastly, the appellant contended that admittance of evidence regarding gang tattoos, not belonging to him, was a fault on the trial court's part.\n\nFacts and Legal Proceedings:\n\nThe relevant incident occurred at around 2:00 A.M. on July 13, 2018, when the Odessa Police Department (OPD) received information about a gunshot victim near an Odessa convenience store. The victim, Treginale White, was found alive but later succumbed to the gunshot wounds, and his death was ruled as homicide.\n\nSergeant Justin Caid, an OPD detective from the robbery/homicide unit of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), started his investigation of the shooting at around 3:15 A.M. He located evidence such as blood traces, bullet defects in a vehicle associated with the victim, discharged .40 caliber firearm shells, and fragments of projectile jacketing. Multiple witness interviews were conducted, one of whom stated to have seen the appellant shoot the victim.\n\nInvestigative officers obtained surveillance footage from the convenience store, which showed the appellant running towards the victim with raised arms, firing four gunshots, and subsequently fleeing the scene. The appellant's behavior suggested he was carrying a firearm tucked into his waistband, corroborated by the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, who confirmed his habit of carrying a firearm in this manner.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe jury's examination of the aforementioned evidence and testimonies led to the conviction of the appellant for murder, felony murder, and participation in organized criminal activity. The appeal has partly been affirmed and partly vacated. The court's decision signifies that the convictions align with legal standards and that the evidence was sufficient to support them. However, some issues raised in the appeal may require further consideration.\n", "Citation:\n\nSalinas, T. v.

His community supervision conditions required him to abide by all state and federal laws, report to his community supervision officer, and pay a $100 fine, court costs, and $600 in reimbursement fees.\n\nFollowing this, the State filed an application to adjudicate guilt, alleging that Salinas had violated eight conditions of his community supervision. A hearing regarding this application was held on October 24, 2022. The State presented evidence supporting their allegations, while Salinas admitted that the allegations were partially true. The trial court found Salinas guilty of breaching his supervision conditions, thus revoking his community supervision, adjudicating him guilty, and sentencing him to twenty years of confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\nIn this appeal, Salinas' court-appointed counsel has submitted a motion for withdrawal. Supporting this motion is a brief in which the counsel, after reviewing and professionally examining the record and the applicable law, concludes that there are no defensible issues to present on appeal. The counsel furnished Salinas with copies of the brief, the withdrawal motion, an explanatory letter, as well as the clerk\u2019s record and the reporter\u2019s record. They informed Salinas of his rights to review the record, respond to the brief, and file a petition for discretionary review as per Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 68. The court-appointed counsel is in compliance with the stipulations of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); and Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\nSalinas subsequently filed a self-represented response to his counsel\u2019s Anders brief, in which he requested the appointment of a new attorney for the appeal. He, however, did not address the case's merits. Following Anders and Schulman's procedures, we independently examined the record and agreed with the counsel's conclusion that there are no defensible grounds for appeal.\n\nNevertheless, the judgment adjudicating Salinas guilty requires him to pay $600 in reimbursement fees for court-appointed counsel, an order initially made when he was placed on deferred adjudication. While the initial order deferring adjudication of guilt found Salinas to have the financial resources to pay the said reimbursement fees, the final judgment adjudicating him guilty does not include a similar finding.\n\nThe record reveals that Salinas was deemed indigent prior to the revocation hearing. According to Article 26.05(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court shall order the reimbursement of court-appointed attorney fees only if it determines that the defendant has the financial resources to pay part or all of the costs of legal services, including expenses and costs (Texas Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 26.05(g) West Supp. 2023).\n\nGiven that the record does not indicate that the trial court, upon reordering the payment of reimbursement fees, ascertained that Salinas possessed the financial resources or capability to pay the appointed attorney\u2019s fees, the court committed an error by assessing those fees. Cates v. State, 402 S.W.3d 250, 252 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) ruled that the judgment should be modified to omit the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of a record finding that an indigent defendant could repay the costs of court-appointed counsel. Consequently, we adjust the judgment to exclude the reimbursement fees.\n\nWe, therefore, grant the counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and affirm the trial court's judgment.", "The following citation pertains to a court document electronically filed in the Supreme Court under the case number SCWC-XX-XXXXXXX on January 19, 2024, at 1:40 PM and documented as Dkt. 5 ODSAC. The court case involves US Bank National Association, who is acting as a trustee for Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust Inc., Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series 2005-11, in the capacity of a respondent and plaintiff-appellee. The petitioners and defendants-appellants in the case are Howard E. Greenberg and Denise C. Greenberg. Additional respondents and defendants-appellees in the case are Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Ke Ali'i Kai Association, Inc.\n\nThis case has been elevated to the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai'i through certiorari, from the Intermediate Court of Appeals, and is identified with the civil number 16-1-0554(1). The application for writ of certiorari has been dismissed, as stated in an order released by the Supreme Court. The reason for the dismissal is cited to be that the judgment on appeal in this matter has not been filed by the Intermediate Court of Appeals at the time when the application for a writ of certiorari was filed, as stipulated by Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7 602-59(a) (2017) and Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 36(b)(1) (2016).\n\nThe dismissal of the application for writ of certiorari was filed on December 15, 2023.

Their approval is indicated by their respective signatures on the order.", "In the case number 22-50583, Larry R. Steele, a Texas prisoner (#01864228), filed an appeal against the dismissal of his civil rights action. This case was brought to the attention of the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, on January 19, 2024. Steele sought permission to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal, challenging the district court's certification that the appeal is not in good faith. \n\nThe defendants in this case include the United States Postal Service (USPS), the State of Texas, the United States, Bryan Collier (Executive Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice), and Bobby Lumpkin (Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division). Judges Clement, Engelhardt, and Ramirez presided over the case.\n\nSteele's claims against the USPS, the United States, and the State of Texas were dismissed by the district court, which concluded that these defendants were immune from legal action. Steele argued that the USPS had lost its status as a governmental entity and should therefore not be afforded sovereign immunity. However, this claim was found to be incorrect based on the ruling in Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 U.S. 481, 484 (2006).\n\nDespite Steele's assertion of federal question jurisdiction against the USPS and the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, it was ruled that this does not negate the potential for sovereign immunity unless there is a statute waiving such immunity. Relevant case law includes Elldakli v. Garland, 64 F.4th 666, 670 (5th Cir.), and the cert. denied, No. 23-115, 2023 WL 8531894 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, Steele's assertion that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Administrative Procedures Act may waive sovereign immunity in certain situations was determined to be inapplicable in this case, as per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 and McAfee v. 5th Cir. Judges, 884 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\nSteele's argument that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar lawsuits against the State of Texas because he was alleging that the defendant was acting contrary to federal law was also found to be incorrect, according to Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 339-40 (1979).\n\nIn regard to the individual defendants, officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), Steele did not contest the district court's dismissal of the claims against them in their official capacities. Consequently, any arguments related to this were considered abandoned, as noted in Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, 813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\nSteele claimed that the individual defendants violated his rights of access to the courts under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as TDCJ prisoners are only permitted to send legal mail to the courts via USPS. He argued that due to undue delays in the postal system and the existence of third-party delivery services, prisoners should be allowed to use alternative means to deliver legal mail. However, Steele failed to demonstrate that the exclusive use of USPS prevents prisoners from having a reasonably adequate opportunity to challenge their convictions or the conditions of their confinement.", "United States Court of Appeals, \nFifth Circuit, \nCase No. 22-10783\nFiling Date: January 19, 2024\nClerk: Lyle W.

Traylor subsequently filed claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for excessive use of force, unlawful arrest, and fabrication of evidence. The District Court granted qualified immunity to Officer Yorka for the excessive force and unlawful arrest claims, but denied immunity for the fabrication-of-evidence claim. After considering the details of the case, this Court has decided to uphold part of the District Court's decision and reverse another part for reasons explained below.\n\nCase Background:\n\nOn the night of February 16, 2020, Marcus Traylor and three of his friends visited the Clutch Bar and Restaurant in Dallas, Texas. On the same evening, Dallas Police Department Officer Gideon Yorka and another officer were acting as private security at the bar while off duty and in full uniform.\n\nDuring their time at the bar, Traylor\u2019s group ordered bottle service that included a bottle of champagne and two bottles of hard liquor. Traylor claims to have consumed two or three glasses of champagne over an hour. At some point, the bar's security asked the group to leave due to one of Traylor's friends falling asleep. Traylor reportedly lingered to settle his bill, leading a bouncer to physically remove him from the premises.\n\nOfficer Yorka was outside during this altercation but was informed by Clutch's security about an altercation inside and was asked to assist. Yorka and his colleague then entered the bar where they found Traylor being restrained on the floor by Clutch security with a bloodied mouth. Yorka then escorted Traylor out of the bar, during which he noticed a smell of alcohol on Traylor's breath.\n\nThe events that transpired outside Clutch Bar are disputed by the parties. According to Traylor, he was cooperative as Yorka guided him out of the bar and into the street. Yorka instructed Traylor to leave, but Traylor insisted that his belongings, including his wallet, were still inside the bar. Traylor then walked towards the curb to seek assistance from a security guard or another person to retrieve his belongings. As he approached the curb, Yorka allegedly struck him in the face, causing him to fall.\n\nYorka, however, tells a different story. He alleges that Traylor was uncooperative as he was being escorted out of the bar, repeatedly trying to turn around and go back inside. Yorka asserts that he was able to maintain control of the situation despite Traylor's actions.", "The following is an analysis of a court case with the document number 00517038944, filed on January 19, 2024, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The parties involved in the case are the State of Montana, serving as the plaintiff and appellee, and Christopher Robin Ledean, serving as the defendant and appellant.\n\nThe matter at hand pertains to an application made by the appellant for an extension of time. The nature of the motion suggests that the appellant requested additional time to prepare, file, and serve their opening brief on appeal. This request was necessitated by unspecified reasons contributing to the appellant's inability to meet the original deadline.\n\nUpon review, the court found merit in the appellant's request.

As per the order, the appellant was given an extension until March 4, 2024, to carry out the aforementioned tasks related to their appeal.

Serenity Alana Mann, Chief Justice Mike McGrath of the Montana Supreme Court granted an extension for the appellant's opening brief on appeal on January 19, 2024. The court case number for this proceeding is DA 23-0380. The appellant, Serenity Alana Mann, had requested for additional time to prepare, file, and serve their opening brief. This extension was granted on the grounds of good cause.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in this case reflects the Court's commitment to ensuring that all parties involved in a legal proceeding are given ample opportunity to prepare their cases effectively. This decision further reinforces the principle that the legal process allows for flexibility and adjustments in timelines when justified reasons are presented.\n\nIn legal proceedings, time is an essential factor. The time allocated to each party to prepare their case and argue it before the court is of pivotal significance. A defendant or appellant's rights to a fair trial are influenced by their ability to prepare and present their case, and the court must ensure these rights are observed.\n\nThe order by Chief Justice Mike McGrath demonstrates the court's recognition of these rights. By granting the extension, the court is not only guaranteeing a fair opportunity for the appellant to present their case but also maintaining the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nThe court order, however, does not provide details on the nature of the 'good cause' that led to the decision. The term 'good cause' is often subjective and is determined by the court based on the circumstances of each case. While the specifics are not provided, the Court\u2019s order to grant an extension indicates that the reasons presented by the appellant were compelling enough to warrant additional time.\n\nThis order can have significant implications for the appellant, Serenity Alana Mann. It provides her with the necessary time to prepare an effective argument for her appeal. It allows the appellant to thoroughly examine the details of their case, gather all necessary evidence, and formulate a strong and comprehensive argument.\n\nAs with all court orders, the decision of the Montana Supreme Court in this case sets an example for future related proceedings. By granting the extension, the Court is underlining the significance of ensuring all parties are given adequate time to prepare their arguments. This can serve as a reference in future cases where similar requests for extensions are made.\n\nIn conclusion, the order by the Supreme Court of Montana on January 19, 2024, in the case of the State of Montana v. Serenity Alana Mann (Case Number: DA 23-0380), represents the Court\u2019s commitment to fairness and justice.

Upon review of the case, the court found that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for the proposed initiative petition was in significant compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and ORS 250.085(5).

Albert Smith, 2024 IL App (1st) 192218-U, decided on January 19, 2024, by the Fifth Division in the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial District.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe case concerns the appeal of Albert Smith, who was charged on September 27, 2016, with three counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer and one count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. After a jury trial conducted on August 6, 2019, Mr. Smith was found guilty of aggravated battery of a peace officer and subsequently sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment. He appealed the conviction and sentence on three grounds: ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to provide an expert on cross-racial identification, plain error committed during the State\u2019s closing arguments, and erring by the trial court in sentencing him as a Class X offender.\n\nThe judgment from the Appellate Court, delivered by Justice Lyle, with concurrence from Presiding Justice Mitchell and Justice Mikva, upheld the conviction but remanded the case to correct the mittimus, acknowledging that the trial court had erred by sentencing Mr. Smith as a Class X offender. The court found no evidence of ineffective assistance or plain error.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe charges against Mr. Smith were leveled based on an incident on May 26, 2016, when Officers Terrence Pratcher and Anthony Rosen of the Chicago Police Department were informed by a confidential informant about a black man selling drugs from a tan Cadillac, bearing partial license plate \"E30\" on the 1600 block of Homan Avenue. The officers, in plainclothes, went to the reported location but were unable to locate the vehicle. About an hour later, they spotted a car matching the description and observed a black man in the driver's seat who drove away when the officers made a U-turn.\n\nThe officers followed the vehicle but lost sight of it. They searched the area hoping that it would stop, but eventually, they lost sight of it. The court allowed the statement of the confidential informant to be admitted for the limited purpose of explaining the officers\u2019 subsequent actions. The defense counsel lodged objections against the admission of this evidence, but these were dismissed by the court.", "In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Espigmenio Hernandez, Jr., a pro se plaintiff, initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA), collectively called the defendants. The lawsuit was centered around records linked to Hernandez's prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiff sought to acquire these records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. \n\nThe court, after deliberations, granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment while denying Hernandez's cross-motion for summary judgment. This decision was made based on several reasons, which are discussed further in this opinion.\n\nPreviously, Hernandez was convicted in the Western District of Texas for intending to distribute marijuana, violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He is now serving his sentence at the Fort Worth Federal Correctional Institution. On February 5, 2014, the plaintiff wrote to the EOUSA requesting access to any records about him, invoking FOIA and the Privacy Act for his request. \n\nThe EOUSA subsequently forwarded Hernandez's request to the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO/TXW). A paralegal associated with the USAO/TXW was tasked with identifying potential records responsive to Hernandez's request. \n\nThe paralegal discovered 459 pages of potentially relevant documents, which were categorized as 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of correspondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages that originated from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Following her assessment, she classified the public records and grand jury transcripts as non-releasable but forwarded the remaining correspondence, attorney work product, and DEA documents to the EOUSA, amounting to 38 pages. The EOUSA then transferred the 8 pages of DEA documents back to the DEA, leaving 30 pages consisting of correspondence and attorney work product. However, out of these, only 12 pages were deemed responsive by the EOUSA.\n\nRegarding the 12 responsive pages, the EOUSA informed Hernandez that the office would fully release 4 pages, partially release 1 page, and fully withhold 7 pages based on FOIA exemptions. Hernandez contested this decision, administratively appealing the EOUSA's determination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). \n\nIn his appeal, Hernandez sought the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work product that the USAO/TXW had initially identified. Despite receiving Hernandez's filing, the OIP never informed him of any decision on his timely appeal. \n\nThis led Hernandez to sue the DOJ and the EOUSA, claiming that the defendants violated FOIA and the Privacy Act by not providing all the records he is entitled to. Subsequently, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. \n\nIn partially resolving these motions, the court upheld the withholding of the grand jury transcripts, but could not ascertain whether the 18 pages of supposed nonresponsive correspondence and attorney work product were properly held back by the EOUSA. As a result, the defendants were asked to present those 18 pages for an in-camera review. \n\nHowever, instead of submitting the 18 pages for review, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and decided to disclose the 18 pages to Hernandez. \n\nUpon attempting to release the previously withheld documents, the EOUSA encountered a problem. They could only locate \"15 pages that were withheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\" and were \"unable to determine\" what constituted the remaining 3 pages.", "United States District Court for the District of Columbia\n\nEspigmenio Hernadez, Jr., Plaintiff, v. U.S. Department of Justice, et al., Defendants. \n\nCase No. 15-CV-944 (JMC)\n\nOrder\n\nIn view of the reasons detailed in the associated memorandum opinion, the court has decided the following orders:\n\n1. The defendants' motion for summary judgement, ECF 35, is approved.\n2. The plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgement, ECF 38, is rejected.\n\nThe court instructs that the Clerk of Court to close this case.

The case was filed under the number 15-CV-944 (JMC) in the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nUpon consideration of the facts of the case and the legal arguments presented, the court made certain decisions in relation to the motions for summary judgement filed by both the plaintiff and the defendants. A summary judgement is a determination made by a court without a full trial. Such a judgement may be awarded if the court finds that no major facts are disputed and the matter is clear under the law.\n\nThe defendants had filed a motion for summary judgement, identified in the court records as ECF 35. Upon review, the court found merit in their motion and accordingly, the motion was granted. This typically means that the court agreed with the defendants' position and found that there was no need for a full trial on their part of the case.\n\nIn contrast, the plaintiff also filed a cross-motion for summary judgement, identified as ECF 38. A cross-motion is made by a party opposing a motion filed by the other party and typically seeks a judgement in their favor on the same or related issues. In this instance, the court decided against the plaintiff's motion. This denial indicates that the court did not agree with the plaintiff's position and found that the matter could not be resolved without a full trial on those issues.\n\nFollowing these rulings, the court ordered the Clerk of Court to terminate, or close, this case. This signifies the end of the court's proceedings in this matter. However, the court noted that this is a final appealable order. This means that, while the court has made its decision, that decision can be appealed to a higher court. This provides an avenue for the parties to seek further legal redress if they believe the court decision was incorrect.\n\nFinally, the order was made and entered into the records of the court on January 19, 2024. This gives the exact date on which the order was made, which can be relevant for certain legal timelines, such as the period within which an appeal can be filed. The order was made by Judge Jia M. Cobb, a United States District Judge presiding over the case. The judge's name is important as it identifies the judicial officer who made the decision and is accountable for it.\n\nThe above constitutes a detailed interpretation of the order issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in the case of Espigmenio Hernadez, Jr. versus the U.S. Department of Justice and others.", "In the case of No. 23-13961, under the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, the appeal was filed by plaintiffs Kenneth Johnson and Jacquelyn Johnson against the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Lowndes County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The appeal was made with regards to the dismissal of their motion for default judgment by the district court. This document, Document 14-1, was filed on January 19, 2024.\n\nThe appeal was reviewed by Judges Rosenbaum, Luck, and Brasher of the Eleventh Circuit, who came to a unanimous decision. The decision of the panel was to dismiss the appeal, due to a lack of jurisdiction. As per the United States Code Title 28, Section 1291, as well as case precedents such as CSX Transportation, Inc. v. City of Garden City (235 F.3d 1325, 1327, 11th Cir. 2000), World Fuel Corporation v. Geithner (568 F.3d 1345, 1348, 11th Cir. 2009), and Massachusetts Casualty Insurance Company v. Forman (469 F.2d 259, 260 n.1, 5th Cir. 1972), an order of denial for a default judgment is not considered final or appealable. As the Johnsons' appeal was based on such an order, the court determined that they lacked the jurisdiction to review their claim.\n\nThis decision was made per curiam, meaning by the court as a whole rather than a specific judge. All parties involved were notified that any potential petition for rehearing must comply with the terms stated in the Eleventh Circuit Rule 40-3, along with all other relevant regulations.  \n\nTherefore, the appeal from the Northern District of Georgia Court, with the D.C. Docket No. 1:23-cv-04218-LMM, filed by Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, was dismissed due to a lack of jurisdiction. The decision was based on the fact that the appealed action - a denial of a motion for default judgment - does not constitute a final, appealable order. As such, the court does not have the authority to review the case. Any future appeal or request for review will have to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the Eleventh Circuit.", "United States Court of Appeals\nFor the First Circuit\n\nNo. 22-1776\n\nAPPELLANTS: LOURDES RIVERA RODR\u00cdGUEZ; MARIA DE LOS ANGELES RAMOS RODR\u00cdGUEZ; and RAFAEL PACHECO RODR\u00cdGUEZ,\n\nVS.\n\nAPPELLEES: HOSPITAL SAN CRISTOBAL, INC.; QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES OF PUERTO RICO, INC.; IRIS V\u00c9LEZ GARC\u00cdA; ZACAR\u00cdAS A.

The plaintiffs allege that the care provided to Rodr\u00edguez was negligent, leading to her death. The case was heard in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, and summary judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants, which is the subject of this appeal. This Court affirms the judgment of the District Court.\n\nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed and are as follows.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, a 71-year-old woman suffering from chronic conditions, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, visited HSC on February 29, 2016, complaining of pelvic pain. Her examination was conducted by Dr. Iris V\u00e9lez Garc\u00eda (\"Dr. V\u00e9lez\"), her regular gynecologist since 2005. After conducting a pelvic ultrasound, which revealed a \"complex cystic mass\" near Rodr\u00edguez's right ovary, Dr. V\u00e9lez recommended that Rodr\u00edguez undergo a bilateral oophorectomy via laparotomy.\n\nThe surgery was carried out at HSC on April 21, 2016, by Dr. V\u00e9lez. During the surgery, Dr. V\u00e9lez discovered that Rodr\u00edguez had a \"frozen pelvis\" with multiple \"intraabdominal adhesions,\" and she sought the assistance of Dr. Zacar\u00edas A. Mateo Minaya (\"Dr. Mateo\"), a fellow gynecologist at HSC. After the surgery, Rodr\u00edguez was discharged from HSC on April 25, 2016, following confirmation of \"positive bowel sounds\" and report of \"positive stool passage.\"\n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez returned to HSC on April 29, 2016, for a scheduled postoperative appointment with Dr. V\u00e9lez. At this time, she reported \"nausea, vomiting, and abdominal/pelvic pain\" since April 26. Following these complaints, she was admitted to HSC's emergency department and was diagnosed with a presumed perforated sigmoid colon. Later that day, an emergency exploratory laparotomy was conducted by Dr. V\u00e9lez, Dr. Mateo, and another doctor, Dr. Ortiz Rosado, to address her perforated colon. The procedure involved a \"partial colectomy with Hartman[n] pouch, end colostomy, and subtotal hysterectomy.\" Rodr\u00edguez was then admitted to HSC's intensive care unit (\"ICU\") in critical condition and was intubated on a respirator with a nasogastric (\"NG\") tube, a colostomy bag, and a Foley catheter.\n\nThe details of Rodr\u00edguez's treatment and eventual passing are sourced from reports prepared by the expert witnesses proposed by the parties, based on Rodr\u00edguez's medical records from her visits to HSC. It is important to note that Dr. Ortiz Rosado, who assisted in Rodr\u00edguez's emergency laparotomy, is not named as a party to this suit.", "In the United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit, Case Nos. 22-1171 and 22-1172, the United States of America was the appellee versus Luis \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n-Cordero, otherwise known as Luis El Loco or El Loco, who was the defendant and appellant. The appeal originated from the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, presided over by Honorable Judge Francisco A. Besosa.\n\nThe appellant was represented by Alejandra Bird-L\u00f3pez, a Research and Writing Attorney, along with Eric Alexander Vos, Federal Public Defender, and Franco L. P\u00e9rez-Redondo, Assistant Federal Public Defender, and Supervisor, Appeals Section. The appellee was represented by Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, with the support of W. Stephen Muldrow, United States Attorney, and Mariana E. Bauz\u00e1-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, Circuit Judge Thompson delivered the judgement. Luis \u00c1ngel Col\u00f3n-Cordero was arrested for breaching conditions of his supervised release, and upon his arrest, authorities discovered evidence of additional violations and new criminal behavior. This resulted in Col\u00f3n being brought to court for sentencing hearings for this new criminal case and for the revocation of his supervised release.\n\nThe prosecution and defense agreed to request sentences within the guidelines. However, the district court, not bound by these parties' suggestions, imposed a more severe sentence of imprisonment for Col\u00f3n's new criminal conduct. Additionally, the court issued the maximum possible term of imprisonment for violating his supervised release. These sentences were ordered to run consecutively.\n\nCol\u00f3n, upon appeal, argued that these sentences were unreasonable, using a variety of arguments to support his case. The appeals court, after carefully considering the circumstances, decided to vacate the sentences and remand the case for resentencing.\n\nIn regard to the background of the case, Col\u00f3n, in 2017, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, under violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to 45 months and 19 days of imprisonment and 8 years of supervised release. Col\u00f3n completed his term of imprisonment and was released in 2019, after which he began his term of supervised release.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Col\u00f3n has an intellectual disability and a history of mental health issues. For instance, he was referred to a mental health specialist at the age of 15 due to a school referral. He has also engaged in self-harm, including burning himself with heated car antennas and cigarettes and using blades to cut himself. These resulted in visible scars. At the time of his 2017 plea, a 25-year-old Col\u00f3n had a history of substance abuse, including smoking marijuana, using non-prescription Xanax, Percocet, and Klonopin, and occasional alcohol use.\n\nAs a part of his supervised release, which commenced in August 2019, Col\u00f3n was referred for substance abuse and mental health treatment. The mental health treatment was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting lockdowns, but Col\u00f3n continued his substance abuse treatment. Throughout his supervised release term, Col\u00f3n tested positive for cannabinoids twice, out of seventeen tests, and failed to report to the drug-testing program once.\n\nIn addition to these positive drug tests, Col\u00f3n violated another supervised release condition by possessing a weapon, which was discovered during his 2021 arrest.", "SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\nCase: ANTHONY MAZZARELLI - Petition for Reinstatement from Administrative Suspension (Out of State)\nCase No. 166 DB 2023 (No. 1 RST 2024)\nAttorney Registration No. 91500\n\nORDER\n\nPer Curiam\n\nDated: January 18, 2024\n\nA Report and Recommendation was submitted to the court by the Disciplinary Board Member on January 11, 2024.

This rule signifies that the order is not precedent except within the boundaries established by Rule 23(e)(1). The case in question is 'The People of the State of Illinois' versus 'Jeffrey Hood', with Appeal No. 23 CR 10956 from the Circuit Court of Cook County, under the jurisdiction of Judge Shelly Sutker-Dermer. \n\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by Justice Martin, with Presiding Justice Rochford agreeing with the ruling. However, Justice Ocasio III dissented. The court had the responsibility to decide whether the circuit court's order granting the State's application for revocation of Jeffrey Hood's pretrial release was an abuse of discretion. \n\nJeffrey Hood, the defendant, was appealing against this order, which was issued under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h), effective from September 18, 2023. Hood's arrest and subsequent charges fell under the provisions of Public Act 101-652, known as the Safety, Accountability, Fairness, and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which came into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nHood had been charged with a Class 2 felony, which included aggravated battery of a peace officer, as well as criminal trespass to land. On October 4, 2023, he was allowed pretrial release, provided he adhered to specific conditions. These conditions entailed reporting to the Adult Probation Department\u2019s Pretrial Services Division and abstaining from visiting a nearby high school.\n\nFollowing allegations of Hood being charged with a new felony while on pretrial release, the State, under section 5/110-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) (725 ILCS 5/110-6 (West 2022)), petitioned for the revocation of the pretrial release. The State contended that no conditions of release would ensure Hood\u2019s appearance in subsequent hearings or prevent him from being charged with a new felony or Class A misdemeanor.\n\nDuring the hearing on October 23, the State suggested that Hood, while on the scene of a fight involving his stepdaughter at North-Grand High School, interfered with police officers attempting to disperse the fight. This incident, the State argued, was a violation of the conditions of Hood's pretrial release and a reason to revoke it. The court ruling, therefore, had to take these considerations into account.", "Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. (2024). In The People of the State of Illinois, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Edwin Quintero, Defendant-Appellant. 2024 IL App (1st) 2129-U, No. 1-23-2129B. \n\nThis report discusses a case presented in the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. The judgment was delivered by Justice Oden Johnson and concurred by Justices C.A Walker and Tailor. The case concerns the plaintiff, The People of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, Edwin Quintero. The final judgment was filed on January 18, 2024, under the Supreme Court Rule 23. The judgment is not considered a precedent except under specific conditions indicated by Rule 23(e)(1).\n\nThe defendant, Edwin Quintero, through his attorney, filed an appeal under the Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(h) (eff. Sept. 18, 2023). The appeal challenged the trial court's order issued on September 28, 2023, as per the Pretrial Fairness Act. The defendant was accused of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing leading to damage above $300, and aggravated assault of a peace officer using a motor vehicle.\n\nThe defendant's attorney indicated that the trial court abused its discretion as it claimed that no condition or a combination of conditions could mitigate the defendant's willful flight. However, the court did not articulate clear alternative restrictions or specify why those proposed alternatives would not reduce the defendant's likelihood of willful flight.\n\nThe court hearing revealed that on September 27, 2023, police officers received notification of a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was intercepted but did not stop until it crashed and got stuck between a wall and a light pole. The defendant, reportedly the driver, attempted to escape but was apprehended a short distance away. The defendant later confessed to knowing that the vehicle was stolen but denied trying to hit the police officer.\n\nIn his defense, the defendant's attorney argued that the defendant was a 19-year-old lifelong resident of Chicago. His mother and pregnant fianc\u00e9e, with whom he had a child, were present in court during the hearing. The defendant had completed three years of high school, earned a food handling certificate, and was employed as a dishwasher at a restaurant.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the trial court decided in favor of the state's petition to detain the defendant based on the defendant's risk of willful flight and denied him pretrial release. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on October 5, 2023, and a Rule 604(h) memorandum, and the state filed a memorandum in response.\n\nThe judgment of the court was later reversed and remanded for the reasons stated in the report.", "The appeal case of K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc. vs. The Western Surety Company et al. was made known in the Court of Appeal of the State of California, particularly the Third Appellate District in San Joaquin, bearing the case numbers C096705 and C097987. This court action originates from the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, with case number STK-CV-UCC-2017-0011949, which decision was delivered by Judge Jayne Chong-Soon Lee. The appeal was filed by K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc., with Downey Brand, Matthew J. Weber, Alexandra K. LaFountain, and Jennifer L. Williams representing the plaintiff. \n\nOn the defendants' side, The Western Surety Company et al., they were represented by Brunn & Flynn, Gerald E. Brunn, John K. Peltier, and Drexwell M. Jones. The judgment from the Superior Court was affirmed by the appellate court. Furthermore, K & S Staffing Solutions, Inc. filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court, which was ultimately denied. \n\nIn addition to the denial of the petition for rehearing, a modification was made to the opinion filed on January 2, 2024. At the end of the last paragraph of part I of the Discussion on page 7, footnote 3 was added. This footnote requires the renumbering of all subsequent footnotes and addresses four points raised by K & S in their petition for rehearing. \n\nFirst, K & S acknowledges that the text of the mechanics\u2019 lien law has changed over time, but argues that the Legislature intended the law to continue covering the same types of claimants mentioned in the older cases. The court, however, finds that K & S cannot obtain the relief it seeks by characterizing itself as a \u201claborer\u201d under section 9100. \n\nSecondly, K & S interprets section 8024 to define a laborer as both (1) any person who, acting as an employee, performs labor on a project, and (2) any person who bestows skill or other necessary services on a project. However, the court disagrees, asserting that the statute\u2019s plain terms only refer to a \u201cperson who, acting as an employee,\u201d does particular things; it does not include persons who are not acting as employees. \n\nThe third point raised by K & S alludes to Government Code section 68081, where they claim they are entitled to a rehearing because the court interpreted the term \u201claborer\u201d differently than the parties had briefed. However, the court maintains that the cited provision only applies when the court makes a decision based on an \u201cissue\u201d that was not proposed or briefed; in this case, the court based its decision on the very issue and indeed, the very statute that parties raised.\n\nLastly, K&S asserts that they should be granted relief under section 9100, subdivision (a)(1). This provision describes one of the categories of persons who may assert a claim against a payment bond. However, K & S never discussed this particular provision in its initial briefing, nor has it shown that it satisfied the distinct procedural requirements for seeking relief under this provision. Consequently, the court rejects this claim, as it was raised belatedly and without sufficient support. \n\nIn conclusion, the modification made to the opinion does not change the ultimate judgment of the case. The judges who oversaw the case were HULL, Acting P. J., BOULWARE EURIE, J., and MESIWALA, J. The case was officially filed on January 2, 2024, with the aforementioned details and was certified for publication.", "Case Citation: SGS SPORTS INC. v.

Miller (attorney-in-charge) and Monica P. Triana (Senior Trial Counsel) of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division. Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton and Director Patricia M. McCarthy were also associated with the motion.\n\nThe court had split the case into two phases. In Phase I, it was determined that the warehousing agreement between SGS and 147483 Canada, Inc. constituted a lease or similar use agreement (SGS Sports Inc. v. United States, 47 CIT _, _, 620 F. Supp. 3d 1365, 1380 (2023)). Phase II left to be resolved whether the entries in question were eligible for duty-free treatment under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading 9801.00.20.\n\nThe parties stipulated the following facts:\n\n1. The merchandise under dispute had been previously imported into the United States.\n2. Upon the previous importation, the plaintiff had paid all applicable duties.\n3. While abroad, the imported merchandise had not been advanced in value or improved by any manufacturing process.\n4. The person who reimported the merchandise into the United States was the same person who had initially imported and subsequently exported it.\n\nThe parties argued that these stipulated facts resolved all remaining factual issues and requested a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. While agreeing to the entry of a judgment, the defendant maintained that it did not intend to waive its appeal rights regarding the court's determinations in Phase I of the proceeding.\n\nThe court reviewed the dispute based on USCIT R. 58.1, which allows parties to file a stipulation for judgment on agreed facts at any time while challenging the denial of a protest to the assessment of duties by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The court undertook a de novo review and described the two-step process of resolving classification cases. The first step is to determine the proper meaning of the terms in the tariff provision and the second is to decide whether the subject merchandise falls within the parameters of the tariff provision. The former constitutes a question of law, while the latter is a question of fact. In this instance, the court had already resolved the first step during Phase I of the proceedings, leaving only questions of fact for Phase II.\n\nUnder 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.2, importers generally have to pay duties on goods that were imported into the United States, exported to another country, and then reimported back into the United States. HTSUS subheading 9801.00.20 provides an exception to this rule for merchandise imported into the United States, exported under a lease or similar use agreement, and then reimported into the United States. The HTSUS 9801.00.20 exception is granted when the merchandise is reimported without having been advanced in value.", "Unpublished United States Court of Appeals Decision for the Eleventh Circuit\n\nCase No. 23-13500\nOn a Non-Argument Calendar\n\nTommy D. Lay, II, the Plaintiff-Appellant,\nBryon Dawson, a Plaintiff,\nversus\nStorm Smart Building Systems, Inc.,\nThe Defendant-Appellee.\n\nAn appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, D.C. Docket No. 2:20-cv-00746-NPM\n\nBefore WILSON, BRANCH, and LAGOA, Circuit Judges.\n\nJudges' unanimous decision:\nTommy D. Lay, II, acting in his own defense, has appealed the district court's order from September 22, 2023, which granted his counsel's request to withdraw. A jurisdictional question was posed to the parties regarding the nature of our jurisdiction over this appeal. However, the appellee did not comprehend. Upon examining Lay's response to the jurisdictional question and reviewing the record, we must dismiss this appeal due to the lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe order issued on September 22 is not final as all claims against Storm Smart Building Systems, Inc. have not been fully addressed. As per 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; CSX Transp. Inc. v. City of Garden City, 235 F.3d 1325, 1327 (11th Cir. 2000). The stipulations of voluntary dismissal from February 20, 2023, February 24, 2023, and June 20, 2023, are all invalid as they each aim to dismiss a single claim against Storm Smart rather than the entire action. Refer to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a); Esteva v. Ubs Fin. Servs. Inc. (In re Esteva), 60 F.4th 664, 675 (11th Cir. 2023); Rosell v. VMSB, LLC., 67 F.4th 1141, 1144 (11th Cir. 2023). Also, none of the stipulations were signed by all parties who had appeared in the action. Please see City of Jacksonville v. Jacksonville Hospitality Holdings, L.P., 82 F.4th 1031, 1038-39 (11th Cir. 2023).\n\nOpposite to Lay's arguments, the order which grants counsel's request to withdraw is not an immediately appealable injunctive order. Refer to \u00a7 1292(a)(1); Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 424 F.3d 1117, 1128 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v. Bowman, 341 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003). Nor is it instantly appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or the collateral order doctrine. A comparable situation can be found in Richardson-Merrell, Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 440 (1985) where it was concluded that \"orders disqualifying counsel in a civil case are not collateral orders subject to immediate appeal\"; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (requiring a district judge to certify, in writing, an order for immediate appeal under this subsection).\n\nAll pending motions are hereby denied due to them being inconsequential.", "The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in its file numbered 22-6049, referenced as McGuire v. Loudon County, et al., involves Devin D. McGuire as the Plaintiff-Appellant and the Loudon County, Tennessee, Loudon County Jail, Jailer Brockwell, Jailer Ward, and Captain Keener as the Defendants-Appellees. The file was officially registered on January 19, 2024, under the clerkship of Kelly L. Stephens. This appeal emanates from a decision made by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.\n\nThe presiding judges over the case were Griffin, Bush, and Larsen, with Larsen being the Circuit Judge who presented the opinion. The plaintiff, who was an inmate at Loudon County Jail, lodged a complaint, stating that his Eighth Amendment rights were infringed upon by the jail and its officers. However, the district court dismissed his case under the stipulations of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A due to a lack of a valid claim. After a thorough review of the facts presented, this appellate court decided to affirm the district court's decision in part, vacate it in part, and remand the case back to the district court for further deliberations.\n\nIn June 2022, Devin McGuire, representing himself (pro se), filed a lawsuit against Loudon County Jail and its correction officers namely, Brockwell, Ward, and Myers, under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, citing excessive force. McGuire utilized a complaint form to initiate his suit. However, this form didn't ask him to specify whether he was suing the defendants as individuals or in their official capacity, and McGuire didn't provide this specification either.\n\nA few days later, McGuire submitted a follow-up letter composed of four handwritten pages. This letter reiterated the allegations against the correction officers outlined in the original complaint and introduced new allegations of excessive force by another officer, Captain Keener, which reportedly took place several days after McGuire had submitted his initial complaint. He attached a copy of his original complaint to the letter but, yet again, failed to specify whether he was suing the defendants in their official or individual capacities.\n\nIn July 2022, McGuire filed another prisoner complaint form, which differed slightly from the first. He named Loudon County instead of Loudon County Jail as a defendant and listed Keener as a defendant based on the second incident narrated in his follow-up letter. Unlike the first form, this complaint form contained check boxes under each defendant's name where the plaintiff could designate \"Individual capacity\" or \"Official capacity\". McGuire checked the individual capacity box for Keener and the official capacity boxes for Blackwell, Ward, and Myers. He attached four handwritten pages titled \"Short Summary and Complaint\" and \"Short Summary\" to this complaint form. In these pages, he reiterated the details of the incidents, indicating his desire to keep his lawsuit progressing.\n\nIn October 2022, McGuire filed yet another prisoner complaint form, this time naming Loudon County Jail, not Loudon County, as a defendant. He also named Keener, Ward, and Brockwell as defendants in their official capacity. Myers was not named in this form. He attached to his filing a one-page handwritten document titled \"Short Summary,\" briefly reiterating the same allegations against the defendants and expressing his desire to check on the progress of his case.\n\nA week later, the district court, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1)), screened his complaint. The court interpreted McGuire's October 2022 filing, which contained the least amount of information, as a motion to amend his complaint. The court granted the motion and solely considered the allegations set forth in that filing. The court then ruled that McGuire had failed to state a claim and dismissed the case. The court reasoned that Loudon County Jail is not considered a \"person\" under \u00a7 1983 and is therefore not subject to liability.", "This citation details the proceedings of a legal case filed by the plaintiff, Dr. Lan Yao against Oakland University, which is referred to as the defendant throughout the text. The case was presided over by Circuit Judges GRIFFIN, BUSH, and READLER, with Circuit Judge CHAD A. READLER providing the final judgment. The lawsuit arose following the denial of tenure to Dr. Yao in the nursing school of Oakland University. Dr. Yao alleged that the university had discriminated against her on the basis of race and national origin. Moreover, she contended that the university had taken retaliatory actions against her for filing a workplace complaint.\n\nHowever, the court found these allegations to lack sufficient evidence. No identified employee in a similar position to Dr. Yao had reportedly received more favorable treatment, thus undermining her discrimination claims. Similarly, Dr. Yao was unable to demonstrate a direct correlation between her protected activity and the university's alleged retaliatory actions, rendering her retaliation claim invalid. As a result, the court upheld the previous ruling of summary judgment in favor of the university.\n\nThe tenure process at Oakland University, particularly in its nursing school, was discussed in detail. The university uses a tenure system similar to other higher education institutions, wherein professors serve in term-limited positions before becoming eligible for tenure. The tenure application comprises a dossier documenting the candidate's qualifications, which are then assessed on three criteria: scholarship, teaching, and professional service. Among these criteria, scholarship, particularly critically evaluated publications, holds the most weight. The candidate's published work reflects their contribution to knowledge in a scholarly field.\n\nTwo committees review the tenure application. The first is the Nursing Committee, followed by the Faculty Committee, which uses the candidate's qualifications to make a tenure recommendation to the university. The university's board of trustees, assisted by the provost and president, makes the final tenure determination.\n\nDr. Yao's tenure application journey is outlined in the citation. Originally from China, she was hired as an assistant professor in the nursing school. Following a few years of service, the board approved her reappointment to a final two-year term as an assistant professor, upon completion of which she would become eligible for tenure. Despite the Nursing Committee's support for her reappointment, they noted that she had produced no work for publication. She was strongly advised to submit and publish several empirically-based manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals. However, at the time of her tenure review, she had co-authored only one peer-reviewed article since her reappointment. Consequently, both the Nursing Committee and the Faculty Committee concluded that she had not met the school's criteria for scholarship and research, leading to the denial of her tenure twice.\n\nFollowing the termination of her contract, Dr. Yao filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), citing race and national origin discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She later filed this lawsuit. The district court awarded a summary judgment in favor of the university, concluding that Dr. Yao had failed to demonstrate that she had been treated worse than other non-protected tenure candidates. The court also found that she failed to establish a causative link between her protected activity and the university's alleged retaliatory conduct.", "Citation Format: \n\nUnited States of America, Plaintiff - Appellee, v. Eugene Bilal Anderson, Defendant - Appellant. No. 23-1127. UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. January 19, 2024. Not Recommended for Publication.\n\nA. Case Background\n\nIn the case of United States v. Eugene Bilal Anderson (No. 23-1127), presided over by Circuit Judges Julia Smith Gibbons, White, and Thapar, the appellant Eugene Anderson was sentenced to fifty-one months for counterfeiting United States currency. The case was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on January 19, 2024. \n\nIn March 2021, Anderson was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to make and pass counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 1); making counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 2); and passing counterfeit U.S. currency (Count 3). The indictment alleged that Anderson, utilizing numerous printers, a scanner, and a paper cutter, altered legitimate federal reserve notes to display higher face values. These counterfeit bills were then circulated by Anderson and his co-defendants at various businesses in Southwest Michigan, through which they obtained genuine United States currency and other items of value. Anderson confessed to counterfeiting currency for approximately two years following his arrest.\n\nFollowing his arraignment, Anderson pleaded not guilty and was released on a $20,000 appearance bond by the magistrate judge. As part of the conditions for pretrial release, Anderson was ordered to reside at a community correction facility and submit to drug testing and treatment. However, after two months at the facility, he tested positive for drug use and subsequently absconded. Anderson's whereabouts remained unknown for fourteen months until he was apprehended in August 2022 by the police in response to a report of customers attempting to use counterfeit bills at a McDonald's restaurant. Following his arrest, Anderson pled guilty to all three counts of the indictment.\n\nB. Pre-Sentencing and Sentencing\n\nIn preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office compiled a presentence report, which greatly influenced Anderson's appeal. The report noted that due to Anderson's evasion from pretrial supervision, his offense level computation was enhanced by two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and did not include a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Furthermore, in light of a probationary term associated with a 2015 check forgery conviction, Anderson's criminal history score was increased by two points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) for committing the current offenses while under a criminal justice sentence.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Anderson contested only the probation officer's failure to acknowledge his acceptance of responsibility. After hearing both parties' arguments, the district court overruled the objection. Accepting the probation officer\u2019s calculation of a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of VI, the court sentenced Anderson to a 51-month prison term, the maximum possible within the range. The appeal was filed promptly following the sentencing.\n\nC. Appeal\n\nIn his appeal, Anderson raised two main objections to the sentence issued by the district court. His first contention was that the district court made an error in declining to acknowledge his acceptance of responsibility, citing his guilty plea and cooperation in the presentence investigation as evidence of his acceptance. His second objection, discussed later, pertained to the misapplication of sentencing enhancements relating to his obstruction of justice and his offense committed while under a criminal justice sentence.", "In the case number 22-6093, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, on January 19, 2024, under the presiding judges BOGGS, GILMAN, and NALBANDIAN, deliberated over the case of Farrell Marcum. Marcum, a defendant with a comprehensive and violent criminal history dating back to 1984, was convicted for shooting a man in the leg on his property in the year 2021. The police discovered a loaded firearm in his residence, resulting in charges for firearm possession as a felon. Marcum pleaded guilty to these charges.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the occurrence date of Marcum's earlier convictions, only two were recent enough to contribute towards his criminal-history points. This placement put him in criminal-history category II according to the Presentence Report. However, the district court, considering his consistent criminal activities over nearly four decades and the high probability of recidivism, decided to move him to category IV.\n\nMarcum was sentenced to 71 months of imprisonment, which falls on the higher end of the adjusted Sentencing Guidelines range calculated for a category-IV offender. This sentence has been contested by Marcum, arguing it is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. The court, however, upheld the sentence, ruling that the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nThe circumstances leading to Marcum's arrest on March 29, 2021, involved him shooting a man in the leg, causing a femur fracture. The victim, who was on Marcum\u2019s property, was trying to leave the premises in his car after being ordered to do so by Marcum. Upon the identification of Marcum as the shooter and his established status as a convicted felon, the police executed a search warrant on his home, leading to the discovery of a loaded 9mm handgun. Consequently, Marcum was charged with and admitted guilt to the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u2013 a felon in possession of a firearm. At the age of 59, Marcum was sentenced by the district court to 71 months of imprisonment.\n\nMarcum\u2019s criminal history is extensive, dating back to 1984 when he assaulted a man in a Cincinnati bar by stabbing him in the throat with a pair of hemostats. He also assaulted a police officer during his arrest. This resulted in less than four years of imprisonment. Within months of his parole, Marcum was convicted of DUI and fined. Two years later, he was arrested again for DUI and fined after resisting arrest from the police.\n\nApproximately two years later, Marcum was involved in an altercation with the police where he rammed his car into a police vehicle and escaped. When pursued, he rammed another police cruiser. This led to a year-long prison sentence, of which he served two and a half months. Upon his release, he was once again convicted of DUI and fined.\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 28, Marcum was sentenced to a year in prison when he attempted to sell Valium tablets to an informant of the Kentucky State Police. He served two months. At the age of 34, he was found guilty in a federal court of firearm possession as a felon. The police discovered him unconscious in a car with three loaded guns in the passenger seat, one of which had been stolen. It was later discovered that Marcum had obtained the stolen gun after assaulting its owner multiple times, forcing him to undress, and stealing his clothes. Marcum was sentenced to 103 months of imprisonment for this crime. He later violated his supervised-release conditions but was not reincarcerated.\n\nIn 2006, Marcum, at the age of 42, was convicted in a state court for evading the police. Two years later, he was found guilty in a federal court for trying to possess and distribute cocaine. For these crimes, he served a total of one day in jail and was given four.\n", "Citation Case No. 23-1116\n\nIn the case of the United States vs. Marlen Lavern Stafford, Jr., which was presided over by Chief Judge Sutton, as well as Circuit Judges Clay and Bloomekatz, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, several key events were noted. \n\nIn the case, it was reported that Marlen Stafford Jr. had escaped from a halfway house where he was serving a federal sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Two months after his escape, Stafford was found in a fast-food restaurant by officers who were following him, and they used their patrol cars to block his exit. Instead of surrendering, Stafford aggressively rammed the police vehicles with his own in an attempt to evade capture. He further physically resisted the efforts of seven officers who were trying to subdue him. As a result, Stafford received convictions for felony escape and being a felon in possession of a firearm. His 60-month sentence was challenged on both procedural and substantive grounds, but the court stood by its verdict. \n\nMarlen Stafford is a 31-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and has lived there his entire life. He had a chaotic childhood, bouncing from foster homes to juvenile residential programs. His primary caregivers were his grandmother and his uncle, both of whom have extensive criminal backgrounds. Stafford's criminal history is marked by numerous instances of physically challenging law enforcement and evading capture, with his first adult conviction being for attempting to assault, resist, and obstruct police during a traffic stop. Between 2010 and 2014, he added six more similar offenses to his record.\n\nStafford's conviction under review was a result of another attempted escape and possession of a weapon. In 2020, he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Towards the end of his sentence for this conviction, he was transferred to a residential treatment facility that allowed him to apply for weekend passes to visit his family. However, after leaving to visit his sister on one such weekend, Stafford failed to return to the facility after being asked to leave by his sister. \n\nTwo months after his escape, Stafford was located at a fast-food restaurant by a patrol team. Stafford reacted by ramming his car into the police vehicles blocking his escape for two minutes. This did not work, and he attempted to escape on foot, injuring three of the four officers trying to capture him. He was eventually subdued with the arrival of additional officers. Once under control, Stafford was found to be in possession of a firearm loaded with nine rounds of ammunition. \n\nStafford was indicted on two counts, felony escape, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded guilty to both charges without a plea agreement. Despite the advisory sentencing range of 37 to 46 months, Stafford was sentenced to 60 months. This sentence was contested by Stafford, but the court remained firm in its decision. \n\nIn conclusion, the case of United States vs. Marlen Lavern Stafford, Jr. serves as a stark testament to the escalating nature of criminal behavior and the importance of enforcing consequences for such actions. While the defense made procedural and substantive challenges to Stafford's 60-month sentence, these were ultimately dismissed by the presiding judges, highlighting the seriousness with which the justice system regards repeat and escalating offenses.", "NOT SUGGESTED FOR PUBLICATION\nFile Designation: 24a0024n.06\n\nCase Designations: 23-1180/1183\n\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nSIXTH CIRCUIT                                    FILED\n                                                  January 19, 2024\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                      )           KELLY L.

Moises Jesus Macario-Ramirez pleaded guilty to\n\none count of illegal reentry as per 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and was given a guidelines\n\nsentence of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment at its lower end. Macario-Ramirez now appeals this sentence, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court inappropriately evaluated the\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, giving excessive weight to the negative aspects of\n\nhis criminal history and the need for a sentence of deterrence, while inadequately considering mitigating elements, such as his impoverished upbringing and his role as the sole provider for his family. We, however, find that the district court did not misuse its\n\ndiscretion in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in the case of Macario-Ramirez and hence, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                                             I.\n\nMoises Jesus Macario-Ramirez is a native of Guatemala who has had multiple encounters with the\n\nUnited States immigration system over the past decade due to his undocumented status. Macario-Ramirez migrated\n\nto the United States after experiencing intense poverty in Guatemala. At the tender age of twelve, he\n\nstarted working as a laborer in the fields to assist his family financially. Since his arrival in the United States,\n\nhe has held several jobs to provide for his wife and young child in Indiana as well as for his family back in his home country.\n\nThroughout his stay, Macario-Ramirez has been involved in multiple incidents with law enforcement agencies. Authorities first apprehended Macario-Ramirez when he was nineteen years old in 2010 following suspicion of erratic driving. He failed an on-site sobriety test and confessed to driving under the influence. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to reckless driving and driving without a license.\n\nThe following year, Macario-Ramirez was arrested again after he presented falsified identification papers to the police during a traffic stop. This resulted in two felony charges. Macario-Ramirez failed to attend the preliminary hearing related to these offenses and was subsequently charged with bail jumping. After admitting guilt to each charge, Macario-Ramirez served a two-year prison sentence and was deported to Guatemala in 2015.\n\nDespite his deportation, Macario-Ramirez returned to the United States soon thereafter and continued to accumulate traffic and substance-related offenses. In 2018, for instance, he pleaded guilty to driving without a license following a car accident. In 2020, Macario-Ramirez was arrested for public intoxication at a fashion mall. Following this arrest, it was discovered that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had placed a hold on Macario-Ramirez, and he was subsequently taken into ICE custody. He was then deported from the United States for a second time.\n\nShortly afterwards, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States and was deported for the third time in 2021 after being imprisoned for six months on an illegal reentry charge in Arizona. This charge also resulted in a thirty-six-month term of supervised release for Macario-Ramirez, which prohibited him from committing any further federal, state, or local crimes, and from entering the United States without legal authorization.\n\nDespite these restrictions, Macario-Ramirez reentered the United States again in 2022 and was apprehended for his current offense. He was intercepted by customs officers in Port Huron, Michigan.", "Citation: Unpublished U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Appeal No. 22-1933, Plaintiffs - Appellants Carl T. Norton & Norhurst Properties Danville, LLC v. Defendants - Appellees Wilkins & Co. Realty, Inc., James Buckner, Edward B. Walker, RE Prospects, LLC, and 2291 Schoolfield, LLC.\n\nThis appeal arises from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, at Danville [Case No. 4:21-cv-00039-TDS-JEP] presided by District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder. The appeal was submitted on November 30, 2023, and the court delivered its decision on January 18, 2024.\n\nThe panel consisted of Circuit Judges Niemeyer and Heytens, along with Senior Circuit Judge Floyd. The judgement was upheld and affirmed through an unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\nLegal representatives for the appellants were J. Chapman Petersen and Won Y. Uh from Chap Petersen & Associates, PLC, located in Fairfax, Virginia. The appellees had various legal representatives; James A. L. Daniel, Khalilah A. Walters, and Michael A. Nicholas from Daniel, Medley & Kirby, PC in Danville, Virginia represented James Buckner. Wilkins & Co. Realty, Inc was represented by Mark E. Feldmann, Sr., and Paul G. Beers from Glenn, Feldmann, Darby & Goodlatte in Roanoke, Virginia. Finally, Harold E. Johnson from Williams Mullen in Richmond, Virginia, and Mark D. Loftis from Woods Rogers Vandeventer Black PLC in Roanoke, Virginia represented Edward B. Walker, RE Prospects, LLC, and 2291 Schoolfield, LLC.\n\nThe case revolves around a real estate transaction involving Carl Norton and Norhurst Properties Danville, LLC as plaintiffs who sued the above-mentioned defendants under the court's diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiffs alleged claims of fraud and civil and statutory conspiracy under Virginia law. \n\nThe appeal was brought forth following the district court's order to dismiss the plaintiffs' action on the grounds of failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). After thorough scrutiny and analysis, the court found no error and therefore affirmed the decision.\n\nThe court's review was de novo, accepting the factual allegations of the complaint as true and interpreting them favorably towards the nonmoving party. Quoting from Rockville Cars, LLC v. City of Rockville, 891 F.3d 141, 145 (4th Cir. 2018), the court stated that to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \n\nThe plaintiffs' fraud claim was addressed first under Virginia law. The plaintiffs needed to allege a false representation of a material fact, made intentionally and knowingly with intent to mislead, and that they relied on this misinformation, resulting in damages (Fessler v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., 959 F.3d 146, 153). However, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' allegations did not amount to a fraud claim as the buyer's identity was immaterial to the transaction and the plaintiffs had disclaimed reliance on the buyer's identity in the purchase agreement.\n\nSimilarly, the court found that the district court was correct to dismiss the plaintiffs' civil and statutory conspiracy claim. As per Virginia law, actions for common law civil conspiracy and statutory business conspiracy can only be considered if the plaintiff sustains damages as a result of an act that is itself wrongful or tortious (Dunlap v. Cottman Transmission Sys., LLC, 754 S.E.2d 313, 317). The court concluded that in this case, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate this.\n\nConsequently, the court upheld the decision of the district court, affirming the dismissal of the plaintiffs' action for failing to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of the specificity and materiality of allegations in stating a claim under federal law.", "Case Citation: Gugel v. Pacific Life Insurance Company, No. 23-1073, United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit (Filed: 18th January 2024).\n\nIn the unpublished decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the appellant, Wayne Gugel, sought to contest the orders of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The presiding judge over the District Court case was Bruce H. Hendricks, with the case number being 3:21-cv-01444-BHH. The appeal was presented before Circuit Judges Niemeyer and Richardson, and Senior Circuit Judge Keenan.\n\nThe appeal was brought forth by Wayne Gugel, with Dolores Stegelin and Anne H. Rack as plaintiffs, against Pacific Life Insurance Company, with Shurwest, LLC as the defendant. The appeal was submitted on 21st November 2023 and was decided on 18th January 2024. As per the ruling, the court affirmed the initial decision, upholding it without any modifications.\n\nThe appeal was made against the District Court's orders which granted Pacific Life Insurance Company's motion to dismiss, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), Gugel's claims under South Carolina law for aiding and abetting the breach of a fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation. The District Court also denied Gugel\u2019s motions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 15(b).\n\nUpon reviewing the case record and finding no reversible errors in the District Court's rulings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the initial court's orders. It was expressly noted in Gugel v. Pacific Life Insurance Co., No. 3:21-cv-01444-BHH (D.S.C. Mar. 18, 2022 & Dec. 21, 2022) that there was no need for oral argument since the facts and legal contentions were adequately presented in the materials before the court, and it was judged that an oral argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\nNotably, Robert Rikard and Jeremy C. Hodges from Rikard & Protopapas, LLC, Columbia, South Carolina represented the appellant, while J. D. Quattlebaum and Jonathan D. Klett, from Haynsworth Sinkler Boyd, P.A., Greenville, South Carolina; and Todd M. Fuller from Carlton Fields, P.A., Miami, Florida represented the appellee.\n\nIt must be noted that unpublished opinions such as this one are not considered as binding precedent in this circuit. The court, in this case, followed the standard procedure of reviewing the appeal based on the facts and legal contentions presented in the court materials and found that there was no reversible error in the initial court's orders. Consequently, the court affirmed the orders, indicating that the initial court's rulings were upheld, thereby resolving the appeal.", "Citation:\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals: Fourth Circuit. Appeal No. 22-1762 and No. 22-1778. In re: Lee Andrew Hilgartner, Debtor. Yasuko Yagi, Plaintiff - Appellee, v. Lee Andrew Hilgartner, Defendant - Appellant. Document 36, Filed January 18, 2024. Appeals from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria. Judge Rossie D. Alston, Jr. (Case No. 1:21-cv-01179-RDA-TCB; 1:21-cv-01123-RDA-TCB) Argued October 25, 2023; Decided January 18, 2024. Presiding Judges: Harris, Quattlebaum, and Bell. Affirmed by published opinion. Majority opinion authored by Judge Harris, joined by Judge Quattlebaum and Judge Bell.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn this case, the court deliberated whether and to what extent money owed under a pre-suit settlement agreement arising from a willful and malicious injury fall within the scope of Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code which excepts from discharge debts for willful and malicious injury to another. While the Bankruptcy Code is created to give debtors a fresh start, there are exceptions to the general rule of dischargeability. The court agreed with the district court ruling that the debts in question in this case are non-dischargeable under Section 523(a)(6) and therefore affirmed the judgment.\n\nThe debtor in question, Lee Andrew Hilgartner, had physically assaulted the plaintiff, Yasuko Yagi, in two separate incidents in 2010. Following these incidents, both parties entered into two agreements that obligated Hilgartner to compensate Yagi for the harm he had caused her. The first agreement described the incidents in detail, with Hilgartner admitting to his violent actions. The agreement required him to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments. However, Yagi did not release her claims, leading to a second settlement agreement years later. The second agreement reiterated Hilgartner's factual and legal responsibility for his infliction. The dispute in this case revolves around whether a settlement agreement entered to preempt litigation for a willful and malicious injury creates a non-dischargeable debt for that injury under Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code and whether debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are likewise non-dischargeable under the same section.", "In a case pertaining to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling that debts incurred from a pre-suit settlement for willful and malicious injury are non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the code. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff Yasuko Yagi and against the defendant Lee Andrew Hilgartner.\n\nThe case is cited as follows:\n\nYasuko Yagi, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Lee Andrew Hilgartner, Defendant-Appellant. Nos. 22-1762 & 22-1778, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division. Rossie D. Alston, Jr., District Judge. (1:21-cv-01179-RDA-TCB; 1:21-cv-01123-RDA-TCB). Argued October 25, 2023; Decided January 18, 2024. Before Judges Pamela Harris and A. Marvin Quattlebaum, and Judge Kenneth D. Bell of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, sitting by designation. Affirmed by published opinion. Judge Harris wrote the majority opinion, in which Judges Quattlebaum and Bell joined. James A. DeVita represented the Appellant; Alfredo Acin represented the Appellee. \n\nIn summary, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code typically allows debtors a fresh start by presuming the dischargeability of all legal obligations, no matter how remote or contingent. However, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) enumerates exceptions to this general rule, including \u00a7 523(a)(6), which prevents the discharge of any debt incurred from willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. \n\nIn this case, the defendant Hilgartner had physically assaulted the plaintiff Yagi in 2010. The parties had subsequently entered into two agreements, in which Hilgartner admitted to his violent actions and agreed to compensation payments to Yagi. The first agreement, which is not the main concern of this case, involved Hilgartner admitting to the assault and agreeing to pay Yagi $80,000 in installments. The second agreement, which is central to this case, reiterated Hilgartner's factual and legal responsibility for the harm inflicted on Yagi.\n\nThe issue at hand was whether the settlement agreement that was entered into to avoid litigation over a willful and malicious injury creates a non-dischargeable debt for that injury. Moreover, if it does, the court had to determine whether debts incurred in collecting on the settlement agreement are also non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). The court agreed with the lower court's judgment that these debts are indeed non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). \n\nThis case sets a precedent for future cases involving personal injury settlements and bankruptcy - such debts arising from willful and malicious injury are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, regardless of whether they arise from court judgments or pre-litigation settlements. This interpretation of the law ensures that individuals cannot use bankruptcy as a tool to evade their responsibility for the harm they have inflicted on others.", "Citation:\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, Case No. 23-3037. In the matter of Anthony Williams, Petitioner. Petition for Writ of Mandamus from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Related to D.C. No. 5:20-cv-03511. Submitted under Rule 21, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, December 28, 2023. Before Circuit Judges Bibas, Matey, and Chung. Opinion filed January 19, 2024.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe case in view pertains to a pro se petition filed by Anthony Williams, the petitioner, for a writ of mandamus. This writ would compel the presiding District Judge to recuse himself from Williams' civil rights action. After careful consideration, the court proceeds to deny the petition for the writ of mandamus.\n\nWilliams had previously lodged a complaint alleging the breach of his constitutional rights. His accusation was based on the assaults and conditions he endured while in prison. The District Court partially granted and partially dismissed the defendants' motion to dismiss Williams' second amended complaint. Following the discovery process, the defendants issued a motion for summary judgment, which is still pending.\n\nIn the time leading up to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Williams filed a motion seeking the District Judge's recusal on the grounds of alleged bias. He claimed the District Judge had denied his motions for sanctions against attorney Lucas Repka for purportedly filing papers on behalf of a deceased defendant, and against Repka and another attorney for allegedly making false claims in a discovery-related filing. Williams also stated his motions to depose the defendants and procure interrogatory responses had been denied, and asserted the defendants had not complied with the discovery orders issued by the Court. \n\nThe District Court denied Williams\u2019 motion for recusal along with several other motions, including a motion for compliance and a motion to extend the discovery deadline. The court observed that the discovery deadline had long since passed and that the defendants had fulfilled their remaining discovery obligations.\n\nWilliams, in response, filed his petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court, asserting that the District Judge's recusal was mandated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) as the District Judge's impartiality could be reasonably questioned. He called for the issuance of a writ that would remove the District Judge and reopen discovery.\n\nTo obtain a writ of mandamus, Williams must demonstrate that he has no other adequate means of redress, that he has a clear and indisputable right to the writ, and that the issuance of the writ would be appropriate under the circumstances. However, Williams' reliance on the District Judge\u2019s denials of his motions and his disagreement with the defendants' compliance with their discovery obligations do not form an adequate basis for the District Judge\u2019s recusal. \n\nWilliams has not shown that he is entitled to relief. His displeasure with the legal rulings does not constitute a valid basis for recusal. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that a reasonable person would conclude that the District Judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Therefore, Williams' mandamus petition will be denied by the court.\n"]
