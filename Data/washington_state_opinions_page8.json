Once the prima facie case is made,\n\n\u201c[t]he government must also establish a connection between the proffered evidence\n\nand the defendant.\u201d Id.\n\n       Here, the government put forth the testimony of FBI Special Agent Schofield.\n\nOn October 11, 2018, Agent Schofield discovered two online prostitution\n\nadvertisements that included pictures of the victim alongside Duncan\u2019s phone\n\nnumber. Using his government computer, he utilized the \u201cprint to PDF\u201d feature to\n\nconvert the webpages \u201cto a file that could be saved on the computer.\u201d Agent\n\nSchofield testified that the exhibits the government sought to introduce were \u201cfair\n\nand accurate depictions\u201d of what he saw online, and testified to the website where\n\nhe obtained them. He also testified that he had utilized this feature \u201cprobably\n\nhundreds\u201d of times and had never known it to change the content of the webpage.\n\nThe only information added to the file was a small date stamp and a URL indicating\n\nthe origin of the file. The government then connected the exhibits to Duncan by\n\nreferring to the listed phone numbers, which had already been shown to belong to\n\nhim.\n\n       Duncan objected that the exhibits lacked foundation. Specifically, he argued\n\n\n                                          3                                     22-10278\n\fthat the government failed to prove that Duncan himself had authored the\n\nadvertisements. The court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence,\n\nreasoning that while the government could not definitively say at the time of\n\nadmittance that Duncan authored or created the advertisements, the government had\n\nmade a prima facie case of their authenticity\u2014that is, the online prostitution\n\nadvertisements were what the government purported them to be\u2014and that there was\n\nsufficient connection between the advertisements and Duncan.\n\n      Because we agree with the district court that the government sustained its\n\nburden to make a prima facie showing of authenticity and to connect the exhibits to\n\nDuncan, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them.\n\nThe purpose of Agent Schofield\u2019s testimony was to prove that the exhibits were in\n\nfact true and accurate representations of what he saw on the internet that day. His\n\ntestimony was not presented to prove that Duncan actually authored the posts. Once\n\nthe government proved that the exhibits were accurate copies of the prostitution\n\nadvertisements that Agent Schofield observed online, it was able to connect those\n\nexhibits to Duncan through the phone numbers in the advertisements.\n\n      Duncan\u2019s reliance on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v.\n\nJackson, 208 F.3d 633 (7th Cir. 2000), is unavailing. In Jackson, the Seventh Circuit\n\naffirmed a lower court\u2019s decision to exclude screenshots from a white supremacist\n\nchat room because they could not be authenticated under Rule 801. Id. at 637-38.\n\n\n                                          4                                     22-10278\n\fHowever, the facts of the authentication dispute in Jackson are readily\n\ndistinguishable. In that case, there was significant evidence in the record of the\n\nproponent\u2019s untrustworthiness, leading the trial court to conclude that the proponent\n\nfailed to meet her prima facie burden that the screenshots were what she claimed\n\nthem to be, \u201cas opposed to being slipped onto the groups\u2019 websites by [the\n\nproponent] herself, who was a skilled computer user.\u201d Id. at 638. In this case,\n\nhowever, Duncan never argued to the district court that Agent Schofield was\n\nuntrustworthy in his testimony authenticating the exhibits.        Furthermore, the\n\ngovernment provided further evidence\u2014apart from Agent Schofield\u2019s testimony\u2014\n\nto make a prima facie showing that the online prostitution advertisements were what\n\nthe government claimed them to be.\n\n      Evaluated under the Rule 901 standard as expounded in Tank, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment made an adequate foundational showing of the relevance and the\n\nauthenticity\u201d of the online prostitution advertisements. Tank, 200 F.3d at 631.

For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.\n\n      In 2021, Blount filed a complaint against Leslie and Kim Smith, a registered\n\nnurse, claiming a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights based on deliberate\n\nindifference to his serious medical needs. Blount\u2019s complaint, which he later amended,\n\nstemmed from a decision to discontinue his asthma inhalers and other asthma treatment.\n\nHe averred that, because he did not have his medication, he suffered an asthma attack\n\nwhen correctional officers used oleoresin capsicum spray (pepper spray) in another cell.\n\n      The District Court granted Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss Blount\u2019s amended complaint\n\nbecause Smith, who had denied Blount\u2019s grievance, lacked personal involvement in the\n\nalleged unlawful conduct.1 Following discovery, the District Court granted Leslie\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The District Court ruled that Leslie\u2019s decision to\n\ndiscontinue Blount\u2019s medication was based on his professional judgment and did not\n\nviolate the Constitution. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n A Magistrate Judge adjudicated the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) upon the\nconsent of the parties.\n\n                                            2\n\f         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318,\n\n322 (3d Cir. 2009). The same standard applies to the extent Blount appeals the grant of\n\nSmith\u2019s motion to dismiss. Drummond v. Robinson Twp., 9 F.4th 217, 225 n.4 (3d Cir.\n\n2021).\n\n         As set forth in further detail in the District Court\u2019s decision, Blount\u2019s medical\n\nrecords reflect that he was prescribed asthma medications, including inhalers and a\n\nbronchodilator, while housed at SCI-Benner Township. In April 2019, Blount met with a\n\nphysician\u2019s assistant in the asthma chronic care clinic. The provider noted that Blount\u2019s\n\nasthma control was good and that he used less than one inhaler canister per month.\n\nBlount\u2019s medications were renewed. In June 2019, Blount refused to eat for over a week.\n\nHe refused offers of breathing treatments during this period. Blount met with a nurse and\n\na physician\u2019s assistant in July 2019 with complaints of shortness of breath and/or chest\n\npain. The physician\u2019s assistant noted that Blount had asthma and reported that a change\n\nin therapy was not needed.\n\n         On October 9, 2019, Blount was transferred to SCI-Forest. His transfer records\n\nnoted that he had moderate persistent asthma. It appears that Leslie discontinued\n\nBlount\u2019s asthma medications and removed him from the asthma chronic clinic when he\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\farrived.2 On October 17, 2019, Blount saw Leslie at sick call and told him that he needed\n\nhis inhalers. Leslie\u2019s notes state that Blount did not need inhalers and that Blount should\n\nreturn to sick call as needed. He told Blount that the inhalers had been discontinued\n\nbecause Blount had not picked them up since June. See DCT ECF No. 54-2 at 158; DCT\n\nECF No. 60 at 2.\n\n       Blount told Leslie that his medications were brought to his cell because he was in\n\nthe restricted housing unit, and that his breathing treatments and emergency inhaler were\n\nonly used as needed. He states that Leslie determined that the medications were not\n\nneeded without examining him, and that later that day, he had an asthma attack. Blount\n\nwas exposed to pepper spray and, as a result, suffered labored breathing, chest\n\nconstriction, coughing, and dizziness. Blount states that an inhaler would have relieved\n\nthese ailments. See DCT ECF No. 60 at 2-3.3\n\n       On November 5, 2019, Blount saw a nurse and a certified nurse practitioner for\n\ncomplaints of shortness of breath. He wanted his inhalers reinstated. The nurse\n\npractitioner assessed Blount and concluded that he did not need them. Blount saw Leslie\n\nagain on December 4, 2019.

Negligence is insufficient. Id.\n\n       The District Court found that medical staff at SCI-Forest, including Leslie, had\n\nexamined Blount for asthma-related complaints and that, based on these examinations,\n\nLeslie determined that Blount\u2019s asthma medications were no longer needed. Blount\n\nasserts on appeal that Leslie discontinued his asthma medication based only upon a\n\nreview of his chart, and as a result, he lacked access to medication he needed when he\n\nhad an asthma attack on October 17, 2023.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       The record reflects that a nurse took Blount\u2019s vital signs when he arrived at SCI-\n\nForest on October 9, 2019, and that medical staff monitored him on October 9 and 10\n\nwhile he was confined in a dry cell.4 Medical staff did not examine Blount for asthma-\n\nrelated complaints until after he had the asthma attack on October 17. Leslie saw Blount\n\nearlier that day, and his records do not show that he examined Blount or that Blount had\n\nasthma symptoms. While Blount told Leslie that he needed his inhalers, the record does\n\nnot support the conclusion that Leslie was aware of a need for treatment and intentionally\n\nrefused it. Leslie apparently believed that Blount no longer needed medication because\n\nhe had not been using it. Blount disagrees that Leslie had reason to discontinue his\n\nmedication and contends that Leslie should have known that he could be in danger\n\nwithout an inhaler. However, even if Leslie erred in assessing Blount\u2019s records or\n\ncondition, there was no constitutional violation.5\n\n\n\n\n4\n Blount was confined in a cell without running water because it was believed he might\nhave ingested drugs.\n5\n To the extent Blount appeals the dismissal of his claims against Smith, the District\nCourt did not err in ruling that he did not state a claim for relief based on Smith\u2019s denial\nof his grievance.

For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.\n\n      In 2021, Blount filed a complaint against Leslie and Kim Smith, a registered\n\nnurse, claiming a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights based on deliberate\n\nindifference to his serious medical needs. Blount\u2019s complaint, which he later amended,\n\nstemmed from a decision to discontinue his asthma inhalers and other asthma treatment.\n\nHe averred that, because he did not have his medication, he suffered an asthma attack\n\nwhen correctional officers used oleoresin capsicum spray (pepper spray) in another cell.\n\n      The District Court granted Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss Blount\u2019s amended complaint\n\nbecause Smith, who had denied Blount\u2019s grievance, lacked personal involvement in the\n\nalleged unlawful conduct.1 Following discovery, the District Court granted Leslie\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The District Court ruled that Leslie\u2019s decision to\n\ndiscontinue Blount\u2019s medication was based on his professional judgment and did not\n\nviolate the Constitution.

In April 2019, Blount met with a\n\nphysician\u2019s assistant in the asthma chronic care clinic. The provider noted that Blount\u2019s\n\nasthma control was good and that he used less than one inhaler canister per month.\n\nBlount\u2019s medications were renewed. In June 2019, Blount refused to eat for over a week.\n\nHe refused offers of breathing treatments during this period. Blount met with a nurse and\n\na physician\u2019s assistant in July 2019 with complaints of shortness of breath and/or chest\n\npain. The physician\u2019s assistant noted that Blount had asthma and reported that a change\n\nin therapy was not needed.\n\n         On October 9, 2019, Blount was transferred to SCI-Forest. His transfer records\n\nnoted that he had moderate persistent asthma. It appears that Leslie discontinued\n\nBlount\u2019s asthma medications and removed him from the asthma chronic clinic when he\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\farrived.2 On October 17, 2019, Blount saw Leslie at sick call and told him that he needed\n\nhis inhalers. Leslie\u2019s notes state that Blount did not need inhalers and that Blount should\n\nreturn to sick call as needed. He told Blount that the inhalers had been discontinued\n\nbecause Blount had not picked them up since June. See DCT ECF No. 54-2 at 158; DCT\n\nECF No. 60 at 2.\n\n       Blount told Leslie that his medications were brought to his cell because he was in\n\nthe restricted housing unit, and that his breathing treatments and emergency inhaler were\n\nonly used as needed. He states that Leslie determined that the medications were not\n\nneeded without examining him, and that later that day, he had an asthma attack. Blount\n\nwas exposed to pepper spray and, as a result, suffered labored breathing, chest\n\nconstriction, coughing, and dizziness. Blount states that an inhaler would have relieved\n\nthese ailments. See DCT ECF No. 60 at 2-3.3\n\n       On November 5, 2019, Blount saw a nurse and a certified nurse practitioner for\n\ncomplaints of shortness of breath. He wanted his inhalers reinstated. The nurse\n\npractitioner assessed Blount and concluded that he did not need them. Blount saw Leslie\n\nagain on December 4, 2019.

Because Pharmacia has failed to adduce evidence that satisfies a condition\n\nprecedent necessary for Twin City\u2019s insurance policy to attach, we will affirm.\n\n                                              I\n\n       Pharmacia, a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, purchased a $200 million\n\ndirectors and officers insurance tower1 from thirteen companies through an insurance\n\nbroker.

Clause X, entitled \u201cChoice of Law,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]his\npolicy shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of\nNew York (with exception of the procedural law required by Clause IX [which requires\ndisputes arising under or relating to the policy be resolved under Bermuda\u2019s arbitration\nact], which shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Bermuda.)\u201d\nApp. 1022-23.

Pharmacia Corp., et al., No. 03-cv-01519 (AET) (TJB)\n\nCompl. ECF No. 1, (D.N.J.). After ten years of litigation, the case settled,4 and\n\nPharmacia incurred approximately $207 million in defense and indemnity costs.\n\nPharmacia then provided Twin City proof that the excess carriers ahead of it in the\n\ninsurance tower paid their policy limits5 and asked Twin City to provide coverage.

Specifically, Pharmacia must show both that\n\nthe insurers ahead of Twin City in the tower have (1) \u201cduly admitted liability and [(2)] . .\n\n. paid the full amount of their respective liability.\u201d App. 601.

Regardless of whether the other insurers in the tower paid their\n\npolicy limits, the record does not demonstrate that all of those insurers admitted\n\nliability.9, 10 Because Pharmacia has failed to establish at least one condition precedent,\n\nthe District Court correctly declined to declare that Twin City owes Pharmacia\n\ncoverage.11\n\n\n       8\n          Cf. John M. O\u2019Quinn, P.C. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 906 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir.\n2018) (construing a similar exhaustion provision crafted with the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d to\npermit coverage to attach upon either admission of liability or issuance of payment, i.e.,\n\u201c[coverage] shall not attach unless and until the [u]nderwriters of the [u]nderlying\n[p]olicy/ies shall have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay\u201d).\n        9\n          Moreover, Pharmacia has identified no case that applies \u201cfunctional exhaustion\u201d\nto a situation like the one here, where the insured is required to show both that the other\nexcess carriers admitted liability and that they paid the policy limit.\n        10\n           Pharmacia contends that the District Court improperly considered the other\ninsurers\u2019 settlement agreements for the proposition that they disclaimed liability in\nviolation of FED. R. EVID. 408. See Appellant Br. at 46-49. We need not, however, rely\non the settlement agreements because, even without consideration of those agreements,\nPharmacia has failed to show that all the insurers ahead of Twin City in the insurance\ntower admitted liability, as required by the Policy\u2019s exhaustion provision. Pharmacia\u2019s\nassertion that an insurer\u2019s payment of a policy limit alone constitutes an admission of\nliability is speculative as other reasons may cause a carrier to pay its policy limit, such as\navoiding litigation. In addition, to infer that payment of the full policy is a concession of\nliability would render the admission-of-liability condition superfluous. In any event, the\nDistrict Court did not err by considering the settlement agreements, as Rule 408 \"allows\nevidence of . . . agreements of compromise to prove a consequential, material fact in\nissue other than validity of the claim or its amount,\" such as disclaimers of liability. 2\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence \u00a7 408.08 (2015).\n        11\n           This conclusion is consistent with JP Morgan Chase & Co. v. Indian Harbor Ins.\nCo., 98 A.D.3d 18 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012). There, a court applying Illinois law\ninterpreted an identical exhaustion provision contained in a Twin City policy to\nunambiguously impose two conditions precedent for Twin City\u2019s coverage to attach: (1)\n                                              7\n\f                                             III\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\nadmitting liability and (2) paying the full amount of their liability. Id. at 21. In holding\nthat coverage did not attach, the court noted that \u201c[t]he first condition was not met\nbecause [an excess] insurer . . . in the [] tower\u201d expressly disclaimed \u201c\u2018an admission of\nliability\u2019\u201d in a settlement agreement.

R. EVID. 408. See Appellant Br. at 46-49. We need not, however, rely\non the settlement agreements because, even without consideration of those agreements,\nPharmacia has failed to show that all the insurers ahead of Twin City in the insurance\ntower admitted liability, as required by the Policy\u2019s exhaustion provision. Pharmacia\u2019s\nassertion that an insurer\u2019s payment of a policy limit alone constitutes an admission of\nliability is speculative as other reasons may cause a carrier to pay its policy limit, such as\navoiding litigation. In addition, to infer that payment of the full policy is a concession of\nliability would render the admission-of-liability condition superfluous. In any event, the\nDistrict Court did not err by considering the settlement agreements, as Rule 408 &quot;allows\nevidence of . . . agreements of compromise to prove a consequential, material fact in\nissue other than validity of the claim or its amount,&quot; such as disclaimers of liability. 2\nWeinstein&#x27;s Federal Evidence \u00a7 408.08 (2015).\n        11\n           This conclusion is consistent with JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. v.

Such is the case here. Multi-\nbillion-dollar company FTX Trading Ltd. (\u201cFTX\u201d) filed for\nbankruptcy after a sudden and unprecedented collapse that sent\nshockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. The issue\nbefore us is whether 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c)(2) mandates the\nBankruptcy Court to grant the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner to investigate FTX\u2019s management. We hold that\nit does, given both the statute\u2019s plain text and Congress\u2019s\nexpressed intent in enacting this portion of the Bankruptcy\nCode. Accordingly, we will reverse the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndenial of the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion, and remand for the\nappointment of an examiner consistent with this opinion.\n\n       I.     Factual and Procedural History\n\n       Over the course of eight days in November 2022, the\ncryptocurrency company FTX suffered a catastrophic decline\nin value. The primary owner of FTX, Samuel Bankman-Fried,\nalso owned most of Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency\nhedge fund. In early November, industry reports claimed that\nAlameda Research was financially compromised, and\nquestions regarding a conflict of interest between the two\nallegedly independent companies began to arise. What\nfollowed were discoveries of multiple corporate failures,\nincluding FTX\u2019s use of software to conceal the funneling of\nFTX customer funds into Alameda Research to bolster its\nbalance sheet. These discoveries caused FTX, a company that\nhad been valued at $32 billion earlier in 2022, to face a sudden\nand severe liquidity crisis as customers withdrew billions of\ndollars over the course of a few days. Since the collapse,\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fcriminal investigations into FTX have unearthed evidence of\nwidespread fraud and the embezzlement of customers\u2019 funds.1\n\n        Immediately following the crash, on November 11,\n2022, Mr. Bankman-Fried appointed John J. Ray, III to replace\nhim as CEO of FTX and its numerous affiliates (\u201cFTX\nGroup\u201d). Over the next three days, Mr. Ray filed multiple\nvoluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United\nStates Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. Mr. Ray, an\nexperienced bankruptcy practitioner who claims to have\nsupervised the restructuring of \u201cseveral of the largest corporate\nfailures in history,\u201d stated in his first report as debtor in\npossession that he had never before \u201cseen such a complete\nfailure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of\ntrustworthy financial information.\u201d JA 52. He deemed the\nsituation at FTX Group \u201cunprecedented,\u201d citing, inter alia, the\ncompromised integrity of the companies\u2019 operating systems,\nthe \u201cfaulty regulatory oversight\u201d of FTX\u2019s operations abroad,\nand the \u201cconcentration of control in the hands of a very small\ngroup of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially\ncompromised individuals.\u201d JA 52.\n\n        Mr. Ray further reported that many of the companies in\nFTX Group lacked \u201cappropriate corporate governance,\u201d\noperating without a functioning board of directors and failing\nto produce audited financial statements. JA 59. He maintained\nthat FTX Group \u201cdid not maintain centralized control of its\ncash\u201d and kept no accurate list of its bank accounts or the\naccounts\u2019 signatories. JA 60. FTX Group companies were\nhistorically unable to produce accurate financial statements or\na \u201creliable cash forecast.\u201d JA 60\u201362. As a result of these \u201ccash\nmanagement failures,\u201d Mr. Ray was unable to determine how\nmuch cash the companies had when the bankruptcy petitions\nwere filed. JA 61. He also found that FTX Group had \u201cbillions\nin investments\u201d in non-cryptocurrency assets, but these\ninvestments could not be completely accounted for due to the\n\n\n1\n   On November 2, 2023, Samuel Bankman-Fried was\nconvicted of seven wire fraud, conspiracy, and money\nlaundering charges. His sentencing is scheduled for March\n2024. Other former FTX executives pled guilty to similar\ncharges.\n\n                               4\n\fcompanies\u2019 failure to \u201ckeep complete books and records.\u201d JA\n66.\n\n       In addition, Mr. Ray described how FTX Group failed\nto implement a corporate system to regulate cash\ndisbursements. Employees would simply submit \u201cpayment\nrequests through an on-line \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate\ngroup of supervisors approved disbursements by responding\nwith personalized emojis.\u201d2 JA 64. Mr. Ray discovered that\ncorporate funds were used to purchase homes and other\npersonal items for employees in the Bahamas, where FTX was\nheadquartered. For some real estate purchases, there was no\ndocumentation categorizing the transactions as corporate loans\nand the properties were recorded in the Bahamas under the\nnames of the FTX employees or advisors.\n\n       Regarding the companies\u2019 cryptocurrency assets, Mr.\nRay declared FTX Group engaged in \u201c[u]nacceptable\nmanagement practices\u201d including, inter alia, \u201cthe use of an\nunsecured group email account\u201d to access \u201ccritically sensitive\ndata\u201d and \u201cthe use of software to conceal the misuse of\ncustomer funds.\u201d JA 64\u201365. Mr. Ray claimed to identify $372\nmillion of unauthorized cryptocurrency transfers initiated on\nFTX\u2019s petition date, and the subsequent unauthorized\n\u201cminting\u201d of $300 million in FTX\u2019s cryptocurrency tokens,\nFTTs. Id. The disordered state of FTX Group at the time it\nfiled for bankruptcy, exacerbated by the failure of FTX\nfounders to identify sources of supposed additional assets,\nmeant that Mr. Ray and his team of professionals \u201clocated and\nsecured only a fraction of the digital assets.\u201d Id.\n\n       Within weeks of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions,\nthe United States Trustee moved for the appointment of an\nexaminer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). In so doing, the\nU.S. Trustee posited that a public report of the examiner\u2019s\nfindings could reveal the \u201cwider implications\u201d that FTX\u2019s\nunprecedented collapse had for the cryptocurrency industry.\nJA 97. The U.S. Trustee also claimed an examiner could\n\u201callow for a faster and more cost-effective resolution\u201d of the\n\n2\n Mr. Ray revealed that there was no comprehensive list of FTX\nGroup employees and only incomplete human resource records\nof the terms and conditions of employment.\n                              5\n\fbankruptcy proceedings because Mr. Ray could concentrate on\nhis \u201cprimary duty of stabilizing the debtors\u2019 businesses\u201d while\nthe examiner investigated FTX\u2019s compromised pre-petition\nmanagement, which was purportedly responsible for\nmisappropriating $10 billion in customers\u2019 assets. Id.\n\n       Of greater significance for the purposes of this appeal,\nthe U.S. Trustee argued that the Code mandates the Bankruptcy\nCourt to grant their motion and order the appointment of an\nexaminer. Section 1104(c) provides that, in instances like this\nwhere no trustee has been appointed, then:\n\n       [O]n request of a party in interest or the United\n       States trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the\n       court shall order the appointment of an examiner\n       to conduct such an investigation of the debtor as\n       is appropriate, including an investigation of any\n       allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence,\n       misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\n       the management of the affairs of the debtor of or\n       by current or former management of the debtor,\n       if\u2014\n               (1)    such appointment is in the interests\n                      of creditors, any equity security\n                      holders, and other interests of the\n                      estate; or\n               (2)    the debtor\u2019s fixed, liquidated,\n                      unsecured debts, other than debts\n                      for goods, services, or taxes, or\n                      owing to an insider, exceed\n                      $5,000,000.\n\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c) (emphasis added). The U.S. Trustee\nargued that, because they made the request and FTX Group\u2019s\nunsecured debts \u201csubstantially exceed\u201d $5 million,\nappointment of an examiner was mandatory under the plain\nlanguage of subsection (c)(2).3 JA 98.\n\n\n3\n  In addition, the U.S. Trustee advanced the argument that the\nappointment of an examiner would also be proper under\nsubsection 1104(c)(1), claiming that an investigation would be\n\u201cin the best interests of the Debtors\u2019 estates, their creditors, and\n                                 6\n\f        The Committee for Unsecured Creditors (\u201cCreditors\u2019\nCommittee\u201d), the Joint Provisional Liquidators of FTX Digital\nMarkets Ltd., and the Debtors filed their objections to the U.S.\nTrustee\u2019s motion. At a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court,\nthe U.S. Trustee reiterated their position that the appointment\nof an examiner in this instance is mandatory, and argued this\ninterpretation is supported by legislative history that conveys\nCongress\u2019s intent to guarantee an independent investigation\ninto any large-scale bankruptcy. The opposing parties argued\nthe phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section 1104(c) renders the\nappointment of an examiner subject to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndiscretion. JA 299, 307. They claimed such an appointment\nhere would be highly inappropriate, given that an investigation\nwould create an unjustifiable cost for creditors, interfere with\ntheir efforts to stabilize FTX Group, duplicate their findings of\nmanagement wrongdoing, and pose a security risk to\ncryptocurrency codes.\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court agreed with those who opposed\nthe motion and ruled the appointment of an examiner was\ndiscretionary under the Code. JA 17\u201318. The Court\nacknowledged FTX Group\u2019s unsecured debt far exceeded $5\nmillion but found the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section\n1104(c) allowed it to deny the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner, despite the statutory requirements having been\nmet. The Court supported its conclusion by citing Bankruptcy\nCourt decisions and congressional records from the year before\nthe revised Code was enacted.\n\n       II.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The U.S. Trustee appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndecision to the District Court and moved to certify the order for\ndirect appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2).4 The District\n\nequity security holders\u201d given the grounds to suspect \u201cactual\nfraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct in the management of\nthe Debtors.\u201d JA 100 \u00b6 35.\n4\n  The U.S. Trustee first moved for certification in Bankruptcy\nCourt, and then renewed the motion when jurisdiction\ntransferred to the District Court pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n8006(b).\n                               7\n\fCourt granted the certification motion, and this Court\nauthorized the direct appeal. We have jurisdiction over\nChapter 11 cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A). This Court\nreviews questions of law decided by the Bankruptcy Court de\nnovo. In re Trump Ent. Resorts, 810 F.3d 161, 166\u201367 (3d Cir.\n2016).\n\n       III.   Discussion\n\n       The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation:\nwhether the plain text of Section 1104(c)(2) requires a\nbankruptcy court to appoint an examiner, if requested by the\nU.S. Trustee or a party in interest, and if \u201cthe debtor\u2019s total\nfixed, liquidated, unsecured debt\u201d exceeds $5 million. We\nhold that it does. The Bankruptcy Court erred in denying the\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint an examiner to investigate\nFTX Group.\n\n        \u201cOur interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts\n\u2018where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the\nstatute itself.\u2019\u201d Ransom v. FIA Card Servs., N.A., 562 U.S. 61,\n69 (2011) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489\nU.S. 235, 241 (1989)). In interpreting a statute, we are required\n\u201cto give effect to Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d In re Trump, 810 F.3d at\n167. We presume that intent is expressed through the ordinary\nmeaning of the statute\u2019s language. Id. If the meaning of the\ntext is clear, \u201cthe sole function of the courts\u2014at least where the\ndisposition required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce\n[the statute] according to its terms.\u201d Hartford Underwriters\nIns. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore start by\nexamining the plain text of Section 1104(c).\n\n        Congress made plain its intention to mandate the\nappointment of an examiner by using the word \u201cshall,\u201d as in\nthe Bankruptcy Court \u201cshall\u201d appoint an examiner if the terms\nof the statute have been met. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). The\nmeaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d is not ambiguous. It is a \u201cword of\ncommand,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), that\n\u201cnormally creates an obligation impervious to judicial\ndiscretion,\u201d Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &\nLerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998). We have held that \u201cshall\u201d in\na statute is interpreted as \u201cmust,\u201d which means \u201cshall\u201d signals\n\n                                8\n\fwhen a court must follow a statute\u2019s directive regardless of\nwhether it agrees with the result. Scott v. Vantage Corp., 64\nF.4th 462, 477 (3d Cir. 2023). To interpret \u201cshall\u201d as anything\nbut an obligatory command to appoint an examiner, when the\nconditions of subsection 1104(c)(2) have been met, would\nrequire us \u201cto abandon plain meanings altogether.\u201d Litgo N.J.\nInc. v. Comm\u2019r N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot., 725 F.3d 369, 397\nn.17 (3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). Instead, the language\nof subsection 1104(c)(2) requires us to command the\nBankruptcy Court to grant the U.S. Trustee\u2019s request for an\nexaminer in this instance. See Me. Cmty. Health Options v.\nUnited States, 140 S. Ct. 1308, 1320 (2020) (\u201cThe first sign\nthat the statute imposed an obligation is its mandatory\nlanguage: \u2018shall.\u2019\u201d).\n\n        Despite the mandatory language, the Bankruptcy Court\nfound that the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d controls the\nappointment of an examiner under Section 1104(c). Following\nthis interpretation, the text \u201cthe court shall order the\nappointment of an examiner to conduct such an investigation\nof the debtor as is appropriate\u201d means the Bankruptcy Court\nappoints an examiner only if it decides an investigation would\nsuit the circumstances. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c). According to this\nreading, context gives \u201cshall\u201d the meaning of \u201cmay.\u201d We\ndisagree.     Under the last-antecedent rule of statutory\nconstruction, \u201cqualifying words, phrases, and clauses are to be\napplied to the words or phrase immediately preceding and not\nto others more remote.\u201d Stepnowski v. Comm\u2019r, 456 F.3d 320,\n324 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Hodge, 321 F.3d\n429, 436 (3d Cir. 2003)). Applying the rule, the phrase \u201cas is\nappropriate\u201d modifies the words that immediately precede it\u2014\nwhich are \u201cto conduct such an examination of the debtor,\u201d not\n\u201cshall order the appointment of an examiner.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1104(c).\n\n        Although instructive, the last-antecedent rule is not\nabsolute and we therefore look to other indicia to discern the\nphrase\u2019s meaning. Viera v. Life. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 642 F.3d\n407, 419 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v.\nPilosi, 393 F.3d 356, 365 (3d Cir. 2004)). We need not look\nfar. As the U.S. Trustee argued below, Section 1104(c) states\n\u201cas is appropriate,\u201d not \u201cif appropriate.\u201d JA 288 (emphasis\nadded). While \u201cif appropriate\u201d indicates the Bankruptcy Court\n\n                              9\n\fhas a choice, the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d indicates it is\npermitted to determine what is pertinent given the specific\ncircumstances of each case. This interpretation\u2014that \u201cas is\nappropriate\u201d refers to the nature of the investigation, not the\nappointment of the examiner\u2014is further bolstered by the\ncontext. Immediately after the phrase \u201cas is appropriate,\u201d the\nstatute provides the word \u201cincluding\u201d and a list of topics that\nmerit investigation: \u201callegations of fraud, dishonesty,\nincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\nthe management of the affairs of the debtor of or by current or\nformer management of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c).\n\n        Under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s interpretation, the\nappointment of an examiner under either subsection of Section\n1104(c) would be subject to a court\u2019s discretion and a judge\nwould have the final say as to whether an investigation was\nwarranted. But this interpretation runs counter to the statute\u2019s\nplain language and established canons of construction.\nWhereas subsection 1104(c)(1) permits a court to consider \u201cthe\ninterests of creditors, any equity security holders, and other\ninterests of the estate,\u201d subsection (c)(2) allows for no such\nconsideration. We agree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nthat \u201c[t]he contrast\u201d between the two subsections \u201ccould not be\nmore striking.\u201d In re Revco D.S., Inc., 898 F.2d 498, 501 (6th\nCir. 1990). There is no weighing of interests in subsection\n1104(c)(2); the court is only permitted to determine whether\nthe unsecured debt minimum of $5 million has been met. Id.\nIf we ignore the differences between the plain text of the two\nsubsections, then subsection (c)(2) becomes discretionary and\nindistinguishable from subsection (c)(1). Such a reading\nwould defy the \u201cusual rules of statutory interpretation\u201d by\nassuming that \u201cCongress adopt[ed] two separate clauses in the\nsame law to perform the same work.\u201d United States v. Taylor,\n596 U.S. 845, 857 (2022). We make no such assumption here.\n\n       In addition to contravening rules of statutory\nconstruction, reading subsection (c)(2) as discretionary would\nrequire disregarding direct evidence of Congress\u2019s intent.5 In\n\n5\n The Bankruptcy Code was enacted after a \u201ccompromise bill\u201d\npassed both houses of Congress in October 1978. See Leonard\nL. Gumport, The Bankruptcy Examiner, 20 Cal. Bankr. J. 71,\n91 (1992). When proposing the bill to Congress, the sponsors\n                              10\n\fobtaining passage of the Bankruptcy Code, the Senate floor\nmanager explained the \u201cbusiness reorganization chapter\u201d\nensures \u201cspecial protection for the large cases having great\npublic interest.\u201d 124 CONG. REC. 33990 (1978). Such\nprotection comes from a provision guaranteeing an\n\u201cautomatically appointed\u201d examiner in large cases, a measure\ndesigned to \u201cpreserve[] and enhance[]\u201d debtors\u2019 and creditors\u2019\ninterests, \u201cas well as the public interest.\u201d Id. The Code\u2019s\nsponsors agreed that, in cases where the \u201cfixed, liquidated,\nunsecured debt\u201d reached $5 million, the appointment of an\nexaminer is required \u201cto [ensure] that adequate investigation of\nthe debtor is conducted to determine fraud or wrongdoing on\nthe part of present management.\u201d 124 CONG. REC. 32403\n(1978). To guarantee that \u201cthe examiner\u2019s report will be\nexpeditious and fair,\u201d the sponsors forbade the examiner from\nacting as or representing a trustee in the bankruptcy and\nrequired that the investigation remain separate from the\nreorganization process.6 Id. at 32406. In enacting Chapter 11,\nthe sponsors adopted a revised approach where the needs of\n\nof that legislation, Representative Edwards and Senator\nDeConcini, made \u201cnearly identical statements . . . to their\nrespective chambers.\u201d Id. at 91\u201392. These statements are\n\u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of the legislation\u2019s intent. See Begier v.\nIRS, 496 U.S. 53, 64 n.5 (1990) (\u201cBecause of the absence of a\nconference and the key roles played by Representative\nEdwards and his counterpart floor manager Senator\nDeConcini, we have treated their floor statements on the\nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 as persuasive evidence of\ncongressional intent.\u201d).\n6\n  The Bankruptcy Code \u201cprohibits an examiner from serving as\na trustee or as counsel for the trustee in order to ensure that\nexaminers may not profit from the results of their work.\u201d In re\nBig Rivers Elec. Corp., 355 F.3d 415, 430 (6th Cir. 2004).\nSuch independence distinguishes examiners from other\nparticipants in the Chapter 11 bankruptcies who may\ninvestigate wrongdoing but who also seek to benefit financially\nfrom the reorganization plan. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(b)(1)\n(members of the creditors\u2019 committee \u201cshall ordinarily\u201d consist\nof either the seven largest creditors or those who organized\nbefore the filing of the petition).\n\n                              11\n\fsecurity holders are balanced against \u201cequally important public\nneeds relating to the economy, such as employment and\nproduction, and other factors such as the public health and\nsafety of the people or protection of the national interest.\u201d Id.;\nsee also Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 53 (2002) (\u201c[T]he\nBankruptcy Code incorporates traditional equitable\nprinciples.\u201d). Because subsection 1104(c)(2) was enacted to\nprotect the public interest in larger bankruptcy cases, a \u201crefusal\nto give effect to the mandatory language\u201d regarding the\nappointment of an examiner would result in a failure \u201cto give\neffect to the legislative intention.\u201d 7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6\n1104.03[2][b] (16th ed. 2023).\n\n        Despite this clear intention to protect the public interest,\nCongress tempered the mandatory nature of subsection\n1104(c)(2) by making both the request for an examiner and the\nscope of the investigation subject to acts of discretion. First,\nan examiner is not automatically appointed in cases where $5\nmillion of unsecured debt exists. Rather, the U.S. Trustee or a\nparty in interest must deem one necessary and motion the court.\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(b). While the Debtors argue granting\ndiscretion to every party in interest is illogical and encourages\nabuse, they provide no evidence to support either position.\nThat a party in interest may abuse its discretion by requesting\nan examiner is not grounds for deeming Congress\u2019s grant of\nsuch discretion absurd.7\n\n\n7\n  At argument, the government stated that during the fiscal year\nof 2022, the U.S. Trustee filed fewer than ten motions to\nappoint examiners. Transcript of Oral Argument at 6:20\u201323,\nFTX Trading Ltd. (Nov. 8, 2023) (No. 23-2297). He further\nnoted that there has been no evidence of a \u201cfallout\u201d from the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s decision in In re Revco D.S., Inc., 898 F.3d at\n501, which held the appointment of an examiner is mandatory\nunder subsection 1104(c)(2) in 1990, over thirty years ago. Id.\nat 6:16\u201318; see also George M. Treister & Richard B. Levin,\nFundamentals of Bankruptcy Law 369\u201371 (7th ed. 2010)\n(\u201cRequests for an examiner are infrequent, in both large and\nsmall Chapter 11 cases.\u201d). In any case, courts must \u201cgive effect\nto [a] plain command, even if doing that will reverse the\nlongstanding practice under the statute.\u201d Lexecon Inc., 523\nU.S. at 35 (citations omitted).\n                                12\n\f       Second, while a bankruptcy court must appoint an\nexaminer if the statutory requirements are met, the phrase \u201cas\nis appropriate\u201d in Section 1104(c) means the court \u201cretains\nbroad discretion to direct the examiner\u2019s investigation,\u201d\nincluding its scope, degree, duration, and cost. 5 Norton\nBankr. L. & Prac. \u00a7 99:25 (3d ed. 2023); see also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n330(a)(3). By setting the investigation\u2019s parameters, the\nbankruptcy court can ensure that the examiner is not\nduplicating the other parties\u2019 efforts and the investigation is not\nunnecessarily disrupting the reorganization process.\nMoreover, to the extent the mandatory nature of subsection\n1104(c)(2) encourages parties in interest to invoke an\ninvestigation to tactically delay proceedings, the bankruptcy\ncourt has the discretion to continue with the confirmation\nprocess without receiving the examiner\u2019s findings or public\nreport. 7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1104.03[2][b] (16th ed.\n2023).\n\n        In this instance, the Bankruptcy Court denied the\nmotion for an examiner in part because it deemed Mr. Ray to\nbe \u201ccompletely independent\u201d from FTX\u2019s founding members\nand that any remaining prior officers \u201chave been stripped of\nany decision making authority.\u201d JA 9\u201310. On appeal, the\ndebtors in possession and the Creditors\u2019 Committee argue an\ninvestigation would be duplicative and wasteful given their\nongoing efforts to uncover all pre-petition mismanagement.\nNeither position is relevant, given our holding that the\nappointment of the examiner is mandatory under the Code. But\nnor is either position persuasive, given that Congress has\nguaranteed that an investigation under subsection 1104(c)(2)\nwould differ from those conducted by the Appellees in several\nsignificant ways. 8\n\n\n8\n  The duties of an examiner are set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1106(a)(3) and (4), which provide that an examiner shall,\n\u201cexcept to the extent that the court orders otherwise,\u201d\ninvestigate \u201cthe acts, conduct, assets, liabilities, and financial\ncondition of the debtor, the operation of the debtor\u2019s business\nand the desirability of the continuance of such business, and\nany other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a\nplan;\u201d and then \u201cfile a statement of any investigation,\u201d which\nmust include any fact \u201cpertaining to fraud, dishonesty,\n                                13\n\f         First, an examiner must be \u201cdisinterested\u201d as defined by\n11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14), which means a \u201ccreditor, an equity\nsecurity holder, or an insider,\u201d or anyone with \u201can interest\nmaterially adverse to the interest of the estate\u201d cannot be\nappointed to conduct a Section 1104(c) investigation.9 See 11\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1104(d). The Code also forbids a debtor in\npossession, the quintessential \u201cinsider,\u201d from performing the\nduties of an examiner and investigating itself. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1107(a) (stating a debtor in possession \u201cshall have all the rights\n. . . and powers\u201d and \u201cperform all the functions and duties\u201d of\na trustee, except the duties granted to trustees and examiners in\nsubsections 1106(a)(2) through (4)). An examiner \u201cis first and\nforemost disinterested and nonadversarial\u201d and \u201canswers\nsolely to the Court.\u201d In re Big Rivers Elec. Corp., 355 F.3d\n415, 432 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Baldwin United Corp.,\n46 B.R. 314, 316 (S.D. Ohio 1985)). This requirement of\ndisinterest is particularly salient here, where issues of potential\nconflicts of interest arising from debtor\u2019s counsel serving as\npre-petition advisors to FTX have been raised repeatedly.\nMoreover, the U.S. Trustee raised the concern that, given the\nreports of widespread fraud, officers or employees who may\nhave engaged in wrongdoing could remain at FTX Group. JA\n100 \u00b6 35. In enacting subsection 1104(c)(2), Congress made\ncertain that neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the Appellees\ncould deem these issues unworthy of an outside investigation\nin this particular bankruptcy, which certainly qualifies as a\n\n\n\n\nincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\nthe management of the affairs of the debtor, or to a cause of\naction available to the estate.\u201d\n9\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, a \u201cdisinterested person\u201d is\ndefined as a person that \u201cis not a creditor, an equity security\nholder, or an insider;\u201d \u201cis not and was not, within 2 years before\nthe date of the filing of the petition, a director, officer, or\nemployee of the debtor;\u201d and \u201cdoes not have an interest\nmaterially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of\ncreditors or equity security holders, by reason of any direct or\nindirect relationship to, connection with, or interest in, the\ndebtor, or for any other reason.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(A)\u2013(C).\n\n                                14\n\f\u201clarge case[] having great public interest.\u201d 124 CONG. REC.\n33990 (1978).\n\n        Second, an examiner appointed under subsection\n1104(c)(2) must make their findings public, an obligation\nneither a creditor committee nor a debtor in possession\nshares.10 Compare 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(2) and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1107(a), with \u00a7 1106(a)(4), (b). Requiring a public report\nfurthers Congress\u2019s intent to protect the public\u2019s interest as\nwell as those creditors and debtors directly impacted by the\nbankruptcy. Such protection seems particularly appropriate\nhere. The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its\nworldwide investors but also raised implications for the\nevolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry. For example,\nan investigation into FTX Group\u2019s use of its own\ncryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and\nAlameda Research could bring this practice under further\nscrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed\ncredit risks in other cryptocurrency companies. In addition to\nproviding much-needed elucidation, the investigation and\nexaminer\u2019s report ensure that the Bankruptcy Court will have\nthe opportunity to consider the greater public interest when\napproving the FTX Group\u2019s reorganization plan.11\n\n\n10\n  The public report requirement is set forth in 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1106\n(a)(4)(A) and \u00a7 107(a). Section 1106(a) sets forth the duties of\nan examiner. Subsection 1106(a)(4) directs an examiner to\n\u201cfile a statement of any investigation\u201d which includes \u201cany fact\nascertained pertaining to fraud, dishonesty, incompetence,\nmisconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the\nmanagement of the affairs of the debtor, or to a cause of action\navailable to the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a)(4)(A). Such a\nstatement is deemed public under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(a).\n\n11\n    At argument, counsel for the unsecured Creditors\u2019\nCommittee posited that examiners in large-scale bankruptcies\nare not appointed as a matter of course and cited three\nexamples: In re Genesis Global Holdco, LLC., No. 1:23-bk-\n10063, ECF 1 et seq.

Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the\nBankruptcy Court and remand with instructions to order the\nappointment of an examiner under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c)(2).\n\n\n\n\nNo. 1:20-bk-10418, ECF 1 et seq.

Such is the case here. Multi-\nbillion-dollar company FTX Trading Ltd. (\u201cFTX\u201d) filed for\nbankruptcy after a sudden and unprecedented collapse that sent\nshockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. The issue\nbefore us is whether </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c)(2) mandates the\nBankruptcy Court to grant the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner to investigate FTX\u2019s management. We hold that\nit does, given both the statute\u2019s plain text and Congress\u2019s\nexpressed intent in enacting this portion of the Bankruptcy\nCode. Accordingly, we will reverse the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndenial of the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion, and remand for the\nappointment of an examiner consistent with this opinion.\n\n       I.     Factual and Procedural History\n\n       Over the course of eight days in November 2022, the\ncryptocurrency company FTX suffered a catastrophic decline\nin value. The primary owner of FTX, Samuel Bankman-Fried,\nalso owned most of Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency\nhedge fund. In early November, industry reports claimed that\nAlameda Research was financially compromised, and\nquestions regarding a conflict of interest between the two\nallegedly independent companies began to arise. What\nfollowed were discoveries of multiple corporate failures,\nincluding FTX\u2019s use of software to conceal the funneling of\nFTX customer funds into Alameda Research to bolster its\nbalance sheet. These discoveries caused FTX, a company that\nhad been valued at $32 billion earlier in 2022, to face a sudden\nand severe liquidity crisis as customers withdrew billions of\ndollars over the course of a few days. Since the collapse,\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fcriminal investigations into FTX have unearthed evidence of\nwidespread fraud and the embezzlement of customers\u2019 funds.1\n\n        Immediately following the crash, on November 11,\n2022, Mr. Bankman-Fried appointed John J. Ray, III to replace\nhim as CEO of FTX and its numerous affiliates (\u201cFTX\nGroup\u201d). Over the next three days, Mr. Ray filed multiple\nvoluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United\nStates Bankruptcy Code, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101</span><pre class=\"inline\"> et seq. Mr. Ray, an\nexperienced bankruptcy practitioner who claims to have\nsupervised the restructuring of \u201cseveral of the largest corporate\nfailures in history,\u201d stated in his first report as debtor in\npossession that he had never before \u201cseen such a complete\nfailure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of\ntrustworthy financial information.\u201d JA 52. He deemed the\nsituation at FTX Group \u201cunprecedented,\u201d citing, inter alia, the\ncompromised integrity of the companies\u2019 operating systems,\nthe \u201cfaulty regulatory oversight\u201d of FTX\u2019s operations abroad,\nand the \u201cconcentration of control in the hands of a very small\ngroup of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially\ncompromised individuals.\u201d JA 52.\n\n        Mr. Ray further reported that many of the companies in\nFTX Group lacked \u201cappropriate corporate governance,\u201d\noperating without a functioning board of directors and failing\nto produce audited financial statements. JA 59. He maintained\nthat FTX Group \u201cdid not maintain centralized control of its\ncash\u201d and kept no accurate list of its bank accounts or the\naccounts\u2019 signatories. JA 60. FTX Group companies were\nhistorically unable to produce accurate financial statements or\na \u201creliable cash forecast.\u201d JA 60\u201362. As a result of these \u201ccash\nmanagement failures,\u201d Mr. Ray was unable to determine how\nmuch cash the companies had when the bankruptcy petitions\nwere filed. JA 61. He also found that FTX Group had \u201cbillions\nin investments\u201d in non-cryptocurrency assets, but these\ninvestments could not be completely accounted for due to the\n\n\n1\n   On November 2, 2023, Samuel Bankman-Fried was\nconvicted of seven wire fraud, conspiracy, and money\nlaundering charges. His sentencing is scheduled for March\n2024. Other former FTX executives pled guilty to similar\ncharges.\n\n                               4\n\fcompanies\u2019 failure to \u201ckeep complete books and records.\u201d JA\n66.\n\n       In addition, Mr. Ray described how FTX Group failed\nto implement a corporate system to regulate cash\ndisbursements. Employees would simply submit \u201cpayment\nrequests through an on-line \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate\ngroup of supervisors approved disbursements by responding\nwith personalized emojis.\u201d2 JA 64. Mr. Ray discovered that\ncorporate funds were used to purchase homes and other\npersonal items for employees in the Bahamas, where FTX was\nheadquartered. For some real estate purchases, there was no\ndocumentation categorizing the transactions as corporate loans\nand the properties were recorded in the Bahamas under the\nnames of the FTX employees or advisors.\n\n       Regarding the companies\u2019 cryptocurrency assets, Mr.\nRay declared FTX Group engaged in \u201c[u]nacceptable\nmanagement practices\u201d including, inter alia, \u201cthe use of an\nunsecured group email account\u201d to access \u201ccritically sensitive\ndata\u201d and \u201cthe use of software to conceal the misuse of\ncustomer funds.\u201d JA 64\u201365. Mr. Ray claimed to identify $372\nmillion of unauthorized cryptocurrency transfers initiated on\nFTX\u2019s petition date, and the subsequent unauthorized\n\u201cminting\u201d of $300 million in FTX\u2019s cryptocurrency tokens,\nFTTs. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> The disordered state of FTX Group at the time it\nfiled for bankruptcy, exacerbated by the failure of FTX\nfounders to identify sources of supposed additional assets,\nmeant that Mr. Ray and his team of professionals \u201clocated and\nsecured only a fraction of the digital assets.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       Within weeks of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions,\nthe United States Trustee moved for the appointment of an\nexaminer pursuant to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c). In so doing, the\nU.S. Trustee posited that a public report of the examiner\u2019s\nfindings could reveal the \u201cwider implications\u201d that FTX\u2019s\nunprecedented collapse had for the cryptocurrency industry.\nJA 97. The U.S. Trustee also claimed an examiner could\n\u201callow for a faster and more cost-effective resolution\u201d of the\n\n2\n Mr. Ray revealed that there was no comprehensive list of FTX\nGroup employees and only incomplete human resource records\nof the terms and conditions of employment.\n                              5\n\fbankruptcy proceedings because Mr. Ray could concentrate on\nhis \u201cprimary duty of stabilizing the debtors\u2019 businesses\u201d while\nthe examiner investigated FTX\u2019s compromised pre-petition\nmanagement, which was purportedly responsible for\nmisappropriating $10 billion in customers\u2019 assets. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       Of greater significance for the purposes of this appeal,\nthe U.S. Trustee argued that the Code mandates the Bankruptcy\nCourt to grant their motion and order the appointment of an\nexaminer. Section 1104(c) provides that, in instances like this\nwhere no trustee has been appointed, then:\n\n       [O]n request of a party in interest or the United\n       States trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the\n       court shall order the appointment of an examiner\n       to conduct such an investigation of the debtor as\n       is appropriate, including an investigation of any\n       allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence,\n       misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in\n       the management of the affairs of the debtor of or\n       by current or former management of the debtor,\n       if\u2014\n               (1)    such appointment is in the interests\n                      of creditors, any equity security\n                      holders, and other interests of the\n                      estate; or\n               (2)    the debtor\u2019s fixed, liquidated,\n                      unsecured debts, other than debts\n                      for goods, services, or taxes, or\n                      owing to an insider, exceed\n                      $5,000,000.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c) (emphasis added). The U.S. Trustee\nargued that, because they made the request and FTX Group\u2019s\nunsecured debts \u201csubstantially exceed\u201d $5 million,\nappointment of an examiner was mandatory under the plain\nlanguage of subsection (c)(2).3 JA 98.\n\n\n3\n  In addition, the U.S. Trustee advanced the argument that the\nappointment of an examiner would also be proper under\nsubsection 1104(c)(1), claiming that an investigation would be\n\u201cin the best interests of the Debtors\u2019 estates, their creditors, and\n                                 6\n\f        The Committee for Unsecured Creditors (\u201cCreditors\u2019\nCommittee\u201d), the Joint Provisional Liquidators of FTX Digital\nMarkets Ltd., and the Debtors filed their objections to the U.S.\nTrustee\u2019s motion. At a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court,\nthe U.S. Trustee reiterated their position that the appointment\nof an examiner in this instance is mandatory, and argued this\ninterpretation is supported by legislative history that conveys\nCongress\u2019s intent to guarantee an independent investigation\ninto any large-scale bankruptcy. The opposing parties argued\nthe phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section 1104(c) renders the\nappointment of an examiner subject to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndiscretion. JA 299, 307. They claimed such an appointment\nhere would be highly inappropriate, given that an investigation\nwould create an unjustifiable cost for creditors, interfere with\ntheir efforts to stabilize FTX Group, duplicate their findings of\nmanagement wrongdoing, and pose a security risk to\ncryptocurrency codes.\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court agreed with those who opposed\nthe motion and ruled the appointment of an examiner was\ndiscretionary under the Code. JA 17\u201318. The Court\nacknowledged FTX Group\u2019s unsecured debt far exceeded $5\nmillion but found the phrase \u201cas is appropriate\u201d in Section\n1104(c) allowed it to deny the U.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint\nan examiner, despite the statutory requirements having been\nmet. The Court supported its conclusion by citing Bankruptcy\nCourt decisions and congressional records from the year before\nthe revised Code was enacted.\n\n       II.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The U.S. Trustee appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\ndecision to the District Court and moved to certify the order for\ndirect appeal pursuant to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158</span><pre class=\"inline\">(d)(2).4 The District\n\nequity security holders\u201d given the grounds to suspect \u201cactual\nfraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct in the management of\nthe Debtors.\u201d JA 100 \u00b6 35.\n4\n  The U.S. Trustee first moved for certification in Bankruptcy\nCourt, and then renewed the motion when jurisdiction\ntransferred to the District Court pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n8006(b).\n                               7\n\fCourt granted the certification motion, and this Court\nauthorized the direct appeal.

Discussion\n\n       The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation:\nwhether the plain text of Section 1104(c)(2) requires a\nbankruptcy court to appoint an examiner, if requested by the\nU.S. Trustee or a party in interest, and if \u201cthe debtor\u2019s total\nfixed, liquidated, unsecured debt\u201d exceeds $5 million. We\nhold that it does. The Bankruptcy Court erred in denying the\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s motion to appoint an examiner to investigate\nFTX Group.\n\n        \u201cOur interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts\n\u2018where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the\nstatute itself.\u2019\u201d Ransom v.

We therefore start by\nexamining the plain text of Section 1104(c).\n\n        Congress made plain its intention to mandate the\nappointment of an examiner by using the word \u201cshall,\u201d as in\nthe Bankruptcy Court \u201cshall\u201d appoint an examiner if the terms\nof the statute have been met. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c).

The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its\nworldwide investors but also raised implications for the\nevolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry. For example,\nan investigation into FTX Group\u2019s use of its own\ncryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and\nAlameda Research could bring this practice under further\nscrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed\ncredit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.

Mrad (Mrad) appeals from the order of the Court of Common Pleas\nof Blair County (trial court) dated January 17, 2023, and entered on January 24,\n2023, granting the Altoona City Code Department\u2019s (Code Department) preliminary\nobjections (Preliminary Objections) and dismissing Mrad\u2019s complaint (Complaint)\nwithout prejudice. On appeal, Mrad argues the trial court should have granted him\na default judgment because the Code Department did not timely file its Preliminary\nObjections. Upon review, we affirm.\n                                 I.    Background\n      On November 23, 2022, Mrad filed the Complaint in the trial court against the\nCode Department seeking compensation for the Code Department\u2019s demolition of a\nresidential property he owned at 1616 3rd Street, Altoona, Pennsylvania 16601\n\f(Property). See Original Record (O.R.), Item No. 1. A Deputy with the Blair County\nSheriff\u2019s Office served Mrad\u2019s Complaint on the Code Department on December 9,\n2022. O.R., Item No. 6. On December 30, 2022, the Code Department filed the\nPreliminary Objections, asserting the trial court should dismiss Mrad\u2019s Complaint\nbecause it did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted and lacked\nsufficient specificity. O.R., Item No. 8. The Preliminary Objections also asserted\ngovernmental immunity insulated the Code Department from any potential claims\nrelating to its demolition on the Property. Id.\n       After reviewing Mrad\u2019s Complaint, the Preliminary Objections, and the Code\nDepartment\u2019s supporting memorandum of law, the trial court determined Mrad\u2019s\n\u201cComplaint fails to state a sufficient legal and factual basis for his requested relief.\u201d\nSee O.R., Item No. 9. As a result, the trial court dismissed Mrad\u2019s Complaint without\nprejudice. Id. Mrad appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court.1 On appeal, Mrad\nraised only one question for our review: whether the Code Department filed its\nPreliminary Objections in a timely manner.\n                                       II.    Analysis\n       In reviewing an order sustaining preliminary objections to the legal\nsufficiency of a pleading, our \u201cstandard of review . . . is de novo, and our scope of\nreview is plenary.\u201d       Raynor v. D\u2019Annunzio, 243 A.3d 41, 52 (Pa. 2020).\nPennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1026(a) (Rule 1026(a)) provides that \u201cevery\npleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed within twenty days after service\nof the preceding pleading.\u201d        Pa.R.Civ.P. 1026(a).      Preliminary objections are\npleadings. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1017(a)(4).\n\n\n1\n  Mrad originally appealed to the Superior Court. However, by order filed March 3, 2023, the\nSuperior Court transferred the matter to this Court.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      When a defendant does not file a responsive pleading within Rule 1026(a)\u2019s\n20-day time period, the defendant is in default. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 237.1, 1037. When\na defendant is in default and the plaintiff wishes to obtain a default judgment, the\nplaintiff must provide written notice of his intention to do so at least 10 days before\nfiling a praecipe for a default judgment. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 237.1(2)(ii). If the\ndefendant does not file a responsive pleading within 10 days of the plaintiff\u2019s notice,\nthe plaintiff may obtain a default judgment against the defendant by filing a praecipe\nfor a default judgment. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1037. A defendant may, however, cure his\ndefault by filing a responsive pleading at any time before the plaintiff files a praecipe\nto enter a default judgment. See Mazur v. Cuthbert, 186 A.3d 490, 497 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2018).\n      In Mazur, the defendant did not file a responsive pleading to the plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint within Rule 1026(a)\u2019s 20-day time period. Id. at 496. The plaintiff in\nMazur served the defendant with a 10-day notice of her intention to seek entry of a\ndefault judgment. Id. The defendant responded by quickly filing preliminary\nobjections to the original complaint. Id. A total of 25 days passed between service\nof the complaint and the defendant\u2019s filing of preliminary objections. Id. The trial\ncourt ultimately sustained the defendant\u2019s preliminary objections. Id. On appeal,\nthe plaintiff argued the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s preliminary\nobjections because the defendant filed them beyond Rule 1026(a)\u2019s 20-day time\nperiod. Id.\n      In Mazur, we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument, noting that \u201c[o]nce [the\ndefendant\u2019s] preliminary objections were filed, which occurred before the filing of\na praecipe to enter a default judgment, [the defendant] was no longer in default.\u201d\nMazur, 186 A.3d at 497 (citations omitted). In Mazur, this Court also explained it\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f\u201chas previously noted that the 20-day pleading requirement has not been strictly\nenforced, that said rule is not mandatory but permissive, and that common pleas\ncourts are afforded discretion in accepting late pleadings in the absence of prejudice\nand where justice so requires.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n      Here, the Code Department admits it filed the Preliminary Objections 21 days\nafter being served with Mrad\u2019s Complaint. In the single day the Code Department\nwas in default, Mrad took no steps to serve the Code Department with notice of his\nintention to pursue a default judgment. Nor did Mrad file any response to the Code\nDepartment\u2019s Preliminary Objections. Like the defendant in Mazur, the Code\nDepartment\u2019s filing of the Preliminary Objections before Mrad filed a praecipe for\na default judgment cured the Code Department\u2019s default. See id. Therefore, like in\nMazur, we reject Mrad\u2019s argument the trial court erred in granting the Preliminary\nObjections simply because the Code Department filed them beyond Rule 1026(a)\u2019s\n20-day time period. See id. at 496-97.\n                                   III.   Conclusion\n      For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting the\nCode Department\u2019s Preliminary Objections and dismissing Mrad\u2019s Complaint\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                              STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f        IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nAhmad S.

Drug related activity is the\n       illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, use or possession of a controlled\n       substance, or the possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n       (11) act, and cause family members, guests, other persons on the\n       premises with Resident\u2019s consent and other persons under Resident\u2019s\n       control to act, in a cooperative manner with [Housing Authority] staff\n       and other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled\n       by [the Housing Authority], and refrain from acting or speaking in an\n       abusive or threatening manner toward [Housing Authority] staff and\n       other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled by\n       [the Housing Authority];\n\n       ....\n\n       R. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n\n\ndismissal in this Court, arguing Tenant failed to file and serve a designation of the contents of the\nreproduced record, in violation of Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2154(a), Pa.R.A.P.\n2154(a). The Housing Authority also argued Tenant\u2019s reproduced record did not comply with\nRule of Appellate Procedure 2152(a), Pa.R.A.P. 2152(a), because it did not contain the relevant\ndocket entries. The Housing Authority also objected to the reproduced record because it omitted\nrelevant portions of the trial transcript and the Housing Authority lacked the ability to correct the\nomissions due to Tenant\u2019s failure to designate the contents of the reproduced record. By order\ndated July 11, 2023, this Court denied the Housing Authority\u2019s application for dismissal, noting\nthe Housing Authority did not suffer any prejudice because \u201cthe Court has the original record to\nexamine in its review.\u201d Therefore, we have reviewed the original record and will cite to it\nexclusively.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f             This agreement may be terminated by [the Housing Authority]\n       only for a violation of a material term of this agreement . . . . Violations\n       of material terms of this agreement include, but are not limited to:\n\n       ....\n\n       (10) any illegal or other activity, including but not limited to disorderly\n       behavior or alcohol abuse by [Tenant] . . . which interferes with the\n       health, safety, or the right of peaceful enjoyment of other persons\n       residing in, on, or in the immediate vicinity of property belonging to or\n       controlled by [the Housing Authority] or [its] staff;\n\nId. at 7-8, 14-15.\n       On August 25, 2021, the Housing Authority served Tenant with a letter\n(Termination Notice) notifying him that it was terminating his Lease due to Tenant\u2019s\nfailure to comply with numerous Lease provisions, including the Resident\nObligations found in Section K (10) and K (11). O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. B. The\nTermination Notice also informed Tenant he needed to vacate his apartment within\n30 days or face eviction proceedings. Id. Tenant did not vacate his apartment,2 and\nthe Housing Authority initiated eviction proceedings in the local magisterial district\ncourt. O.R., Item No. 5 at 3. On December 9, 2021, the local district court entered\njudgment in favor of the Housing Authority and against Tenant, granting the\nHousing Authority possession of the apartment and awarding damages in the amount\nof $169.25. O.R., Item No. 1.\n       On December 20, 2021, Tenant appealed the local district court\u2019s judgment to\nthe trial court. Id. On August 24, 2022, the trial court held a bench trial on Tenant\u2019s\n\n2\n    Instead, Tenant filed a grievance under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. Pursuant to\nSection R of the Lease, \u201c[w]hen [Tenant] invokes the grievance procedure involving a\ntermination/vacate notice, the [Housing Authority] shall not enforce the request to vacate until\nafter final disposition of the grievance.\u201d O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. A at 16. The Housing Authority\nwas, however, permitted to file an eviction action after the expiration of the 30-day notice period.\nId. Since the grievance process took more than 30 days to complete, the Housing Authority filed\nits eviction action while it was still processing Tenant\u2019s grievance. See O.R., Items No. 1-5.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fappeal. See generally T.T. 8/24/22.3 At trial, the Garden Towers\u2019 property manager\n(Property Manager) testified and explained the Garden Towers has 98 apartment\nunits which are occupied by low-income elderly and disabled individuals. See id. at\n10-11. The Garden Towers also has one smoking and one non-smoking outdoor\npavilion, each with picnic tables, for its residents\u2019 use and enjoyment. Id. at 20.\nAfter receiving reports of incidents involving Tenant and reviewing Tenant\u2019s file,\nProperty Manager wrote the Termination Notice and served it on Tenant. Id. at\n15-17.\n       Property Manager explained that the Housing Authority provided Tenant with\nthree written notices to remove his personal grill and smoker from the non-smoking\npavilion in June and July of 2019. T.T. 8/24/22 at 21-22. When Tenant did not\ncomply, the Housing Authority was forced to cut the chains Tenant placed on the\nitems in order to remove them. Id. at 21-25. Property Manager also explained\nTenant was provided written notice that he violated the Lease when he engaged in\nverbal altercations with other residents. See id. at 23. Finally, Property Manager\nshowed the trial court several documents the Kittanning Borough Police Department\n(Police Department) provided to the Housing Authority indicating the Police\nDepartment charged Tenant with harassment, and Tenant ultimately pled guilty. Id.\nat 26, 34. Property Manager opined that Tenant engaged in \u201crepeated, disruptive\nbehavior\u201d which made the other residents feel unsafe. Id. at 35-36.\n       Donald Blose (Officer Blose), a police officer for the Police Department,\ntestified that the police have responded to numerous incidents involving Tenant. T.T.\n8/24/22 at 42-43. Officer Blose explained that several residents expressed they were\n\n3\n   \u201cT.T. 8/24/22\u201d refers to the transcript of the bench trial in this matter, which the Honorable\nChase G. McClister conducted on August 24, 2022. Although this transcript was included with\nthe trial court\u2019s original record, it was not given an item number.\n\n\n                                               4\n\fgoing to move out of the Garden Towers to get away from Tenant. Id. at 45. Officer\nBlose filed charges of harassment and disorderly conduct against Tenant for three\nseparate incidents. Id. at 45-47. Officer Blose also opined that many of the problems\nwith Tenant stemmed from him \u201caggressively approaching people on Garden\nTowers\u2019 property telling them to wear a mask.\u201d Id. at 49.\n      Shannon Atherton (Atherton), whose mother resides at the Garden Towers,\ntestified about witnessing Tenant\u2019s aggressive behavior. T.T. 8/24/22 at 56-57. On\nJune 17, 2021, Atherton watched Tenant approach the front of the building, look at\nthe non-smoking pavilion, realize someone else was in the pavilion, act \u201clike\nTerminator,\u201d march to the other resident, and inform the other resident the pavilion\nwas his spot and that the other resident needed to leave. Id. at 58. Tenant demanded,\nmultiple times, that the other resident leave, \u201cpounding his fists on the table like an\nangry child.\u201d Id. at 59. The other resident left, and Tenant would not permit him to\nsit anywhere outside, yelling until the other resident completely left the area. Id.\nTenant then went to the smoking pavilion and demanded a second resident give\nTenant the second resident\u2019s food stamp card. Id. at 59-60. When the second\nresident shook his head no, Tenant said \u201c[k]eep it up. Keep it up or you know what\nyou are going to get.\u201d Id. at 60.\n      Donna D. Myers (Myers), a resident at the Garden Towers, testified Tenant\nthreatened her on an elevator on June 26, 2021. T.T. 8/24/22 at 64. Myers explained\nthe incident occurred after she got on the Garden Towers\u2019 small elevator and Tenant\nrushed in behind her. Id. at 65. The ride started out normally, until Tenant bragged\nabout a new, five-layered face mask and Myers did not respond. Id. at 66. Tenant\nthen \u201cgot extremely enraged at [Myers],\u201d and began chanting about how someone\nwas going to kill her because she was not vaccinated. Id. at 66-67. Myers explained\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fTenant then began \u201cviolently shaking his arm, his great big fist and his index finger\nin my face.\u201d Id. at 67. Tenant then stopped, waited approximately twenty seconds,\nand did the same thing a second time. Id. at 67-68. Myers was terrified and believed\nTenant would hurt or kill her on this elevator ride. Id. at 68-69. Myers requested to\nbe moved to a different building after the incident and was still fearful of Tenant at\nthe time she testified before the trial court. Id. at 68-70.\n      Frankie Wolmeldorf (Wolmeldorf), a former resident of the Garden Towers,\ntestified that Tenant followed him around constantly and made him feel\nuncomfortable. T.T. 8/24/22 at 74, 76-77. Wolmeldorf moved out of the Garden\nTowers because of Tenant\u2019s behavior. Id. at 78.\n      Joseph Boston (Boston), a resident of Garden Towers, testified Tenant has\nthreatened him for years and will not leave him alone. T.T. 8/24/22 at 81. Boston\nrecalled one specific incident that occurred at a nearby grocery store. Id. Boston\ndrove to the grocery store and Tenant, who was riding his bicycle, followed Boston\ninto the grocery store parking lot. Id. at 82. Tenant got off his bicycle and told\nBoston \u201c[y]ou are nothing but an asshole and I am going to beat the shit out of you.\u201d\nId. Tenant then \u201cstarted picking his bicycle up and slamming it up and down and\nusing a bunch of profanity.\u201d Id. Tenant ultimately returned to the Garden Towers\nwithout physically assaulting Boston. Id. On multiple other occasions, Boston\nwitnessed Tenant stand beside another resident who is terminally ill with liver cancer\nand mock her, saying \u201cwhoa, whoa. My liver is hurting.\u201d Id. at 83. Noting that\nTenant is very strong, Boston explained that he lives in fear for his life and health\nbecause he does not have a safe place to live. Id. at 83-84.\n      The Housing Authority\u2019s Executive Director (Executive Director) testified\nthat she was the hearing officer for Tenant\u2019s appeal of the Termination Notice under\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. T.T. 8/24/22 at 88-89, 93. The Executive\nDirector explained that after she heard testimony in Tenant\u2019s grievance appeal of the\nTermination Notice, she concluded\n\n       the residents were clearly fearful of living in the building. Again, they\n       referred to [Tenant] as a bully on the playground and felt that he\n       pr[e]yed on those who were most vulnerable in the building. . . . The\n       majority of residents are either elderly and/or disabled. They are all\n       low income. Most of them don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, so they\n       [are] fearful of losing their home.\n\n       In my opinion, the evidence at that point established that [Tenant] had,\n       in fact, engaged in serious and repeated violations of the [L]ease,\n       mainly concerning the safety of the other residents.\n\nId. at 92-93. Executive Director confirmed she upheld the Termination Notice and\ndenied Tenant\u2019s request for relief under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy.\nId. at 93.\n       Tenant testified on his own behalf. See T.T. 8/24/22 at 103-54. Tenant denied\nany wrongdoing for each incident the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses testified about\nand gave his own version of the facts for some of the incidents. Id. at 109-29. Tenant\nshowed the trial court security camera footage, which did not have any sound, of\ntwo of the incidents in question. Id. at 130-38. On cross examination, Tenant\nadmitted he was in the army, is 6\u02b9 2\u02ba tall, weighs 235 pounds, and lifts weights\nregularly at a local gym. Id. at 138-39.\n       When questioned about why the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses all testified to\nfacts which contradicted his testimony, Tenant asserted the other residents are part\nof a conspiracy against him. Id. at 144. Tenant also asserted the Police Department\nand the Housing Authority are part of this conspiracy. Id. at 147.      Tenant stated\nthere were two reasons for the conspiracy: jealousy and politics. Id. at 148. With\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\frespect to politics, Tenant asserted the conspirators were \u201canti-vaxxers and anti-\nmask and . . . politically on the far right.\u201d Id. With respect to jealousy, Tenant\nclaims he \u201cwon numerous art contests and [is] a self-taught artist\u201d who has about\n45-50 paintings in his room. Id. at 150. Tenant also claimed that \u201csome [of his\npaintings] are worth $10,000.\u201d Id. Despite this claim, Tenant admitted he only ever\nsold one piece of his artwork \u2013 for $40. Id. at 150-51.\n       After reviewing the evidence, the trial court issued the following brief\nfindings of fact:\n\n       1. [Tenant] did not cooperate with the reasonable requests of [the]\n          Housing Authority staff regarding the grill and smoker at the\n          pavilion in violation of Paragraph K (11) of the [Lease].\n\n       2. [Tenant] did engage in criminal activity off the premises, which\n          resulted in a guilty plea, in violation of Paragraph K (10) of the\n          [Lease].\n\n       3. [Tenant] did speak in an abusive manner towards one or more\n          persons residing in [the Garden Towers] in violation of Paragraph\n          K (11) of the [Lease].\n\nO.R., Item No. 14. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Housing\nAuthority. See id. In the trial court\u2019s opinion filed under Pennsylvania Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 1925(a), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the trial court explained it based\nits finding of fact on its conclusion the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses were credible\nand \u201cTenant\u2019s blanket denials of any improper behavior were not credible.\u201d O.R.,\nItem No. 23 at 5.\n       Tenant appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court.4 On appeal, Tenant\nargues the trial court based its decision on insufficient evidence, and the trial court\n\n4\n   Tenant originally appealed to the Superior Court. However, by order filed November 10, 2022,\nthe Superior Court transferred the matter to this Court.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fcommitted legal errors in determining he violated Section K (10) and K (11) of the\nLease.\n                                    II.    Analysis\n      Our review of a non-jury trial verdict is limited to determining whether\nsubstantial evidence supports the findings of the trial court and whether the trial\ncourt committed an error in applying the law.            See Pottstown Sch. Dist. v.\nMontgomery Cnty. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, 289 A.3d 1142, 1145 n.3 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2023) (citation omitted). We must give the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact\n\u201cthe same weight and effect on appeal as the verdict of a jury.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\u201cWe consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner . . . and\nwill reverse the trial court only if its findings of fact are not supported by\n[substantial] evidence in the record.\u201d       Id. (citation omitted). When the issue\n\u201cconcerns a question of law, our scope of review is plenary,\u201d meaning we look at\nthe entire record. Id.\nA. Substantial Evidence\n      We begin with Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported\nby substantial evidence. Tenant believes two of the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses\ncould not have been credible because security camera footage of the incidents\ncontradicts their testimony. First, we note Tenant acknowledged the security camera\nfootage did not include any sound. See T.T. 8/24/22 at 149. Second, we note the\ntrial court did not admit the security camera footage into evidence because Tenant\nfailed to include it in his pretrial statement. See id. at 153-55. Because the trial court\ndid not admit the security camera footage into evidence, we cannot consider it in\ndetermining whether the trial court\u2019s determination was based upon sufficient\nevidence. See Pa.R.A.P. 1921 (providing that only original papers, exhibits, and\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\ftranscripts filed in the trial court and certified docket entries \u201cshall constitute the\nrecord on appeal\u201d); Welsh v. Bulger, 698 A.2d 581, 586 n.12 (Pa. 1997) (appellate\ncourts cannot consider any matter which is not part of the record on appeal).\n      To the extent Tenant argues the trial court watched the security camera\nfootage and those observations, combined with his testimony, should outweigh the\nHousing Authority\u2019s witnesses\u2019 contradictory testimony, we reject Tenant\u2019s\nargument. In addition to observing the security camera footage, the trial court\nobserved Tenant and the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses as they explained what was\nhappening during the incidents in question. The trial court determined the Housing\nAuthority\u2019s witnesses were credible and Tenant was not credible. We will not\ndisturb the trial court\u2019s credibility and weight of the evidence determinations on\nappeal. See Rice v. Compro Distrib., Inc., 901 A.2d 570, 574 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006)\n(\u201cThe trial court, as the finder of fact, has exclusive authority to weigh the evidence,\nmake credibility determinations, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented.\u201d).\n      Considering the evidence, which is summarized above, in the light most\nfavorable to the Housing Authority as the verdict winner, we conclude the record\ncontained substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination. Therefore,\nwe reject Tenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\nB. Section K (11) of the Lease\n      Tenant also argues the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal\nconclusion that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease because the terms\n\u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d in Section K (11) of the Lease are\nvague. See Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. We construe a contract \u201caccording to the meaning\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fof its language. The fundamental rule in construing a contract is to ascertain and\ngive effect to the intention of the parties. The intention of the parties must be\nascertained from the document itself, if its terms are clear and unambiguous.\u201d\nEmpire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Riverside Sch. Dist., 739 A.2d 651, 654 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1999).\n       We disagree with Tenant\u2019s belief that Section K (11) of the Lease is\nambiguous and not clear. Tenant\u2019s behavior, which made other Garden Towers\nresidents live in fear, was abusive, threatening, and not cooperative to his fellow\nresidents under any definition of those terms. Section K (11)\u2019s plain language,\nwhich reflects the Housing Authority\u2019s intention for its residents to be cooperative\nand respectful toward the Housing Authority staff and other residents, supports this\nconclusion. Accordingly, we reject Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court erred in\nconcluding Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease.5\n                                      III.   Conclusion\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings, and the trial\ncourt properly concluded Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease. Because this\nviolation alone entitled the Housing Authority to evict Tenant, we affirm the trial\ncourt\u2019s August 29, 2022 order entering judgment in favor of the Housing Authority\non its complaint in ejectment and breach of contract.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Housing Authority\u2019s complaint and\neject Tenant on the grounds that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease, we need not evaluate\nTenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal conclusion that\nTenant also violated Section K (10) of the Lease. Nevertheless, we note that Section K (10) does\nnot clearly establish whether all off-premises criminal activity or only off-premises drug-related\ncriminal activity violates the Lease.\n\n\n                                               11\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nHousing Authority of the County of    :\nArmstrong                             :\n                                      :\n          v.                          : No. 1413 C.D. 2022\n                                      :\nJoseph S.

Upon review, we affirm.\n                                   I.     Background\n       On December 12, 2017, Tenant executed a Residential Dwelling Lease\nAgreement (Lease) with the Housing Authority to rent an apartment in the Garden\nTowers Apartment Complex (Garden Towers).

RESIDENT OBLIGATIONS\n\n               Resident agrees to:\n\n       ....\n\n       (10) not engage in, and cause family members, guests, other persons on\n       the premises with Resident\u2019s consent and other persons under\n       Resident\u2019s control to not engage in any criminal activity or drug related\n       criminal activity on or off the premises. Drug related activity is the\n       illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, use or possession of a controlled\n       substance, or the possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n       (11) act, and cause family members, guests, other persons on the\n       premises with Resident\u2019s consent and other persons under Resident\u2019s\n       control to act, in a cooperative manner with [Housing Authority] staff\n       and other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled\n       by [the Housing Authority], and refrain from acting or speaking in an\n       abusive or threatening manner toward [Housing Authority] staff and\n       other persons residing in or on property belonging to or controlled by\n       [the Housing Authority];\n\n       ....\n\n       R. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n\n\ndismissal in this Court, arguing Tenant failed to file and serve a designation of the contents of the\nreproduced record, in violation of Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2154(a), Pa.R.A.P.\n2154(a). The Housing Authority also argued Tenant\u2019s reproduced record did not comply with\nRule of Appellate Procedure 2152(a), Pa.R.A.P. 2152(a), because it did not contain the relevant\ndocket entries. The Housing Authority also objected to the reproduced record because it omitted\nrelevant portions of the trial transcript and the Housing Authority lacked the ability to correct the\nomissions due to Tenant\u2019s failure to designate the contents of the reproduced record. By order\ndated July 11, 2023, this Court denied the Housing Authority\u2019s application for dismissal, noting\nthe Housing Authority did not suffer any prejudice because \u201cthe Court has the original record to\nexamine in its review.\u201d Therefore, we have reviewed the original record and will cite to it\nexclusively.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f             This agreement may be terminated by [the Housing Authority]\n       only for a violation of a material term of this agreement . . . . Violations\n       of material terms of this agreement include, but are not limited to:\n\n       ....\n\n       (10) any illegal or other activity, including but not limited to disorderly\n       behavior or alcohol abuse by [Tenant] . . . which interferes with the\n       health, safety, or the right of peaceful enjoyment of other persons\n       residing in, on, or in the immediate vicinity of property belonging to or\n       controlled by [the Housing Authority] or [its] staff;\n\nId. at 7-8, 14-15.\n       On August 25, 2021, the Housing Authority served Tenant with a letter\n(Termination Notice) notifying him that it was terminating his Lease due to Tenant\u2019s\nfailure to comply with numerous Lease provisions, including the Resident\nObligations found in Section K (10) and K (11). O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. B. The\nTermination Notice also informed Tenant he needed to vacate his apartment within\n30 days or face eviction proceedings. Id. Tenant did not vacate his apartment,2 and\nthe Housing Authority initiated eviction proceedings in the local magisterial district\ncourt. O.R., Item No. 5 at 3. On December 9, 2021, the local district court entered\njudgment in favor of the Housing Authority and against Tenant, granting the\nHousing Authority possession of the apartment and awarding damages in the amount\nof $169.25. O.R., Item No. 1.\n       On December 20, 2021, Tenant appealed the local district court\u2019s judgment to\nthe trial court. Id. On August 24, 2022, the trial court held a bench trial on Tenant\u2019s\n\n2\n    Instead, Tenant filed a grievance under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. Pursuant to\nSection R of the Lease, \u201c[w]hen [Tenant] invokes the grievance procedure involving a\ntermination/vacate notice, the [Housing Authority] shall not enforce the request to vacate until\nafter final disposition of the grievance.\u201d O.R., Item No. 5, Ex. A at 16. The Housing Authority\nwas, however, permitted to file an eviction action after the expiration of the 30-day notice period.\nId. Since the grievance process took more than 30 days to complete, the Housing Authority filed\nits eviction action while it was still processing Tenant\u2019s grievance. See O.R., Items No. 1-5.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fappeal. See generally T.T. 8/24/22.3 At trial, the Garden Towers\u2019 property manager\n(Property Manager) testified and explained the Garden Towers has 98 apartment\nunits which are occupied by low-income elderly and disabled individuals. See id. at\n10-11. The Garden Towers also has one smoking and one non-smoking outdoor\npavilion, each with picnic tables, for its residents\u2019 use and enjoyment. Id. at 20.\nAfter receiving reports of incidents involving Tenant and reviewing Tenant\u2019s file,\nProperty Manager wrote the Termination Notice and served it on Tenant. Id. at\n15-17.\n       Property Manager explained that the Housing Authority provided Tenant with\nthree written notices to remove his personal grill and smoker from the non-smoking\npavilion in June and July of 2019. T.T. 8/24/22 at 21-22. When Tenant did not\ncomply, the Housing Authority was forced to cut the chains Tenant placed on the\nitems in order to remove them. Id. at 21-25. Property Manager also explained\nTenant was provided written notice that he violated the Lease when he engaged in\nverbal altercations with other residents. See id. at 23. Finally, Property Manager\nshowed the trial court several documents the Kittanning Borough Police Department\n(Police Department) provided to the Housing Authority indicating the Police\nDepartment charged Tenant with harassment, and Tenant ultimately pled guilty. Id.\nat 26, 34. Property Manager opined that Tenant engaged in \u201crepeated, disruptive\nbehavior\u201d which made the other residents feel unsafe. Id. at 35-36.\n       Donald Blose (Officer Blose), a police officer for the Police Department,\ntestified that the police have responded to numerous incidents involving Tenant. T.T.\n8/24/22 at 42-43. Officer Blose explained that several residents expressed they were\n\n3\n   \u201cT.T. 8/24/22\u201d refers to the transcript of the bench trial in this matter, which the Honorable\nChase G. McClister conducted on August 24, 2022. Although this transcript was included with\nthe trial court\u2019s original record, it was not given an item number.\n\n\n                                               4\n\fgoing to move out of the Garden Towers to get away from Tenant. Id. at 45. Officer\nBlose filed charges of harassment and disorderly conduct against Tenant for three\nseparate incidents. Id. at 45-47. Officer Blose also opined that many of the problems\nwith Tenant stemmed from him \u201caggressively approaching people on Garden\nTowers\u2019 property telling them to wear a mask.\u201d Id. at 49.\n      Shannon Atherton (Atherton), whose mother resides at the Garden Towers,\ntestified about witnessing Tenant\u2019s aggressive behavior. T.T. 8/24/22 at 56-57. On\nJune 17, 2021, Atherton watched Tenant approach the front of the building, look at\nthe non-smoking pavilion, realize someone else was in the pavilion, act \u201clike\nTerminator,\u201d march to the other resident, and inform the other resident the pavilion\nwas his spot and that the other resident needed to leave. Id. at 58. Tenant demanded,\nmultiple times, that the other resident leave, \u201cpounding his fists on the table like an\nangry child.\u201d Id. at 59. The other resident left, and Tenant would not permit him to\nsit anywhere outside, yelling until the other resident completely left the area. Id.\nTenant then went to the smoking pavilion and demanded a second resident give\nTenant the second resident\u2019s food stamp card. Id. at 59-60. When the second\nresident shook his head no, Tenant said \u201c[k]eep it up. Keep it up or you know what\nyou are going to get.\u201d Id. at 60.\n      Donna D. Myers (Myers), a resident at the Garden Towers, testified Tenant\nthreatened her on an elevator on June 26, 2021. T.T. 8/24/22 at 64. Myers explained\nthe incident occurred after she got on the Garden Towers\u2019 small elevator and Tenant\nrushed in behind her. Id. at 65. The ride started out normally, until Tenant bragged\nabout a new, five-layered face mask and Myers did not respond. Id. at 66. Tenant\nthen \u201cgot extremely enraged at [Myers],\u201d and began chanting about how someone\nwas going to kill her because she was not vaccinated. Id. at 66-67. Myers explained\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fTenant then began \u201cviolently shaking his arm, his great big fist and his index finger\nin my face.\u201d Id. at 67. Tenant then stopped, waited approximately twenty seconds,\nand did the same thing a second time. Id. at 67-68. Myers was terrified and believed\nTenant would hurt or kill her on this elevator ride. Id. at 68-69. Myers requested to\nbe moved to a different building after the incident and was still fearful of Tenant at\nthe time she testified before the trial court. Id. at 68-70.\n      Frankie Wolmeldorf (Wolmeldorf), a former resident of the Garden Towers,\ntestified that Tenant followed him around constantly and made him feel\nuncomfortable. T.T. 8/24/22 at 74, 76-77. Wolmeldorf moved out of the Garden\nTowers because of Tenant\u2019s behavior. Id. at 78.\n      Joseph Boston (Boston), a resident of Garden Towers, testified Tenant has\nthreatened him for years and will not leave him alone. T.T. 8/24/22 at 81. Boston\nrecalled one specific incident that occurred at a nearby grocery store. Id. Boston\ndrove to the grocery store and Tenant, who was riding his bicycle, followed Boston\ninto the grocery store parking lot. Id. at 82. Tenant got off his bicycle and told\nBoston \u201c[y]ou are nothing but an asshole and I am going to beat the shit out of you.\u201d\nId. Tenant then \u201cstarted picking his bicycle up and slamming it up and down and\nusing a bunch of profanity.\u201d Id. Tenant ultimately returned to the Garden Towers\nwithout physically assaulting Boston. Id. On multiple other occasions, Boston\nwitnessed Tenant stand beside another resident who is terminally ill with liver cancer\nand mock her, saying \u201cwhoa, whoa. My liver is hurting.\u201d Id. at 83. Noting that\nTenant is very strong, Boston explained that he lives in fear for his life and health\nbecause he does not have a safe place to live. Id. at 83-84.\n      The Housing Authority\u2019s Executive Director (Executive Director) testified\nthat she was the hearing officer for Tenant\u2019s appeal of the Termination Notice under\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy. T.T. 8/24/22 at 88-89, 93. The Executive\nDirector explained that after she heard testimony in Tenant\u2019s grievance appeal of the\nTermination Notice, she concluded\n\n       the residents were clearly fearful of living in the building. Again, they\n       referred to [Tenant] as a bully on the playground and felt that he\n       pr[e]yed on those who were most vulnerable in the building. . . . The\n       majority of residents are either elderly and/or disabled. They are all\n       low income. Most of them don\u2019t have anywhere else to go, so they\n       [are] fearful of losing their home.\n\n       In my opinion, the evidence at that point established that [Tenant] had,\n       in fact, engaged in serious and repeated violations of the [L]ease,\n       mainly concerning the safety of the other residents.\n\nId. at 92-93. Executive Director confirmed she upheld the Termination Notice and\ndenied Tenant\u2019s request for relief under the Housing Authority\u2019s grievance policy.\nId. at 93.\n       Tenant testified on his own behalf. See T.T. 8/24/22 at 103-54. Tenant denied\nany wrongdoing for each incident the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses testified about\nand gave his own version of the facts for some of the incidents. Id. at 109-29. Tenant\nshowed the trial court security camera footage, which did not have any sound, of\ntwo of the incidents in question. Id. at 130-38. On cross examination, Tenant\nadmitted he was in the army, is 6\u02b9 2\u02ba tall, weighs 235 pounds, and lifts weights\nregularly at a local gym. Id. at 138-39.\n       When questioned about why the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses all testified to\nfacts which contradicted his testimony, Tenant asserted the other residents are part\nof a conspiracy against him. Id. at 144. Tenant also asserted the Police Department\nand the Housing Authority are part of this conspiracy. Id. at 147.      Tenant stated\nthere were two reasons for the conspiracy: jealousy and politics. Id. at 148. With\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\frespect to politics, Tenant asserted the conspirators were \u201canti-vaxxers and anti-\nmask and . . . politically on the far right.\u201d Id. With respect to jealousy, Tenant\nclaims he \u201cwon numerous art contests and [is] a self-taught artist\u201d who has about\n45-50 paintings in his room. Id. at 150. Tenant also claimed that \u201csome [of his\npaintings] are worth $10,000.\u201d Id. Despite this claim, Tenant admitted he only ever\nsold one piece of his artwork \u2013 for $40. Id. at 150-51.\n       After reviewing the evidence, the trial court issued the following brief\nfindings of fact:\n\n       1. [Tenant] did not cooperate with the reasonable requests of [the]\n          Housing Authority staff regarding the grill and smoker at the\n          pavilion in violation of Paragraph K (11) of the [Lease].\n\n       2. [Tenant] did engage in criminal activity off the premises, which\n          resulted in a guilty plea, in violation of Paragraph K (10) of the\n          [Lease].\n\n       3. [Tenant] did speak in an abusive manner towards one or more\n          persons residing in [the Garden Towers] in violation of Paragraph\n          K (11) of the [Lease].\n\nO.R., Item No. 14. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the Housing\nAuthority. See id. In the trial court\u2019s opinion filed under Pennsylvania Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 1925(a), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the trial court explained it based\nits finding of fact on its conclusion the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses were credible\nand \u201cTenant\u2019s blanket denials of any improper behavior were not credible.\u201d O.R.,\nItem No. 23 at 5.\n       Tenant appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court.4 On appeal, Tenant\nargues the trial court based its decision on insufficient evidence, and the trial court\n\n4\n   Tenant originally appealed to the Superior Court. However, by order filed November 10, 2022,\nthe Superior Court transferred the matter to this Court.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fcommitted legal errors in determining he violated Section K (10) and K (11) of the\nLease.\n                                    II.    Analysis\n      Our review of a non-jury trial verdict is limited to determining whether\nsubstantial evidence supports the findings of the trial court and whether the trial\ncourt committed an error in applying the law.

When the issue\n\u201cconcerns a question of law, our scope of review is plenary,\u201d meaning we look at\nthe entire record. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nA. Substantial Evidence\n      We begin with Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported\nby substantial evidence. Tenant believes two of the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses\ncould not have been credible because security camera footage of the incidents\ncontradicts their testimony. First, we note Tenant acknowledged the security camera\nfootage did not include any sound. See T.T. 8/24/22 at 149. Second, we note the\ntrial court did not admit the security camera footage into evidence because Tenant\nfailed to include it in his pretrial statement. See id. at 153-55. Because the trial court\ndid not admit the security camera footage into evidence, we cannot consider it in\ndetermining whether the trial court\u2019s determination was based upon sufficient\nevidence. See Pa.R.A.P. 1921 (providing that only original papers, exhibits, and\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\ftranscripts filed in the trial court and certified docket entries \u201cshall constitute the\nrecord on appeal\u201d); Welsh v. Bulger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">698 A.2d 581</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 n.12 (Pa. 1997) (appellate\ncourts cannot consider any matter which is not part of the record on appeal).\n      To the extent Tenant argues the trial court watched the security camera\nfootage and those observations, combined with his testimony, should outweigh the\nHousing Authority\u2019s witnesses\u2019 contradictory testimony, we reject Tenant\u2019s\nargument. In addition to observing the security camera footage, the trial court\nobserved Tenant and the Housing Authority\u2019s witnesses as they explained what was\nhappening during the incidents in question. The trial court determined the Housing\nAuthority\u2019s witnesses were credible and Tenant was not credible. We will not\ndisturb the trial court\u2019s credibility and weight of the evidence determinations on\nappeal. See Rice v. Compro Distrib., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1998409\"><a href=\"/opinion/1998409/rice-v-compro-distributing-inc/\">901 A.2d 570</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006)\n(\u201cThe trial court, as the finder of fact, has exclusive authority to weigh the evidence,\nmake credibility determinations, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence\npresented.\u201d).\n      Considering the evidence, which is summarized above, in the light most\nfavorable to the Housing Authority as the verdict winner, we conclude the record\ncontained substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination. Therefore,\nwe reject Tenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\nB. Section K (11) of the Lease\n      Tenant also argues the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal\nconclusion that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease because the terms\n\u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d in Section K (11) of the Lease are\nvague. See Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. We construe a contract \u201caccording to the meaning\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fof its language. The fundamental rule in construing a contract is to ascertain and\ngive effect to the intention of the parties. The intention of the parties must be\nascertained from the document itself, if its terms are clear and unambiguous.\u201d\nEmpire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Riverside Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2086466\"><a href=\"/opinion/2086466/empire-sanitary-landfill-inc-v-riverside-school-district/\">739 A.2d 651</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 654 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1999).\n       We disagree with Tenant\u2019s belief that Section K (11) of the Lease is\nambiguous and not clear. Tenant\u2019s behavior, which made other Garden Towers\nresidents live in fear, was abusive, threatening, and not cooperative to his fellow\nresidents under any definition of those terms. Section K (11)\u2019s plain language,\nwhich reflects the Housing Authority\u2019s intention for its residents to be cooperative\nand respectful toward the Housing Authority staff and other residents, supports this\nconclusion. Accordingly, we reject Tenant\u2019s argument the trial court erred in\nconcluding Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease.5\n                                      III.   Conclusion\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings, and the trial\ncourt properly concluded Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease. Because this\nviolation alone entitled the Housing Authority to evict Tenant, we affirm the trial\ncourt\u2019s August 29, 2022 order entering judgment in favor of the Housing Authority\non its complaint in ejectment and breach of contract.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the Housing Authority\u2019s complaint and\neject Tenant on the grounds that Tenant violated Section K (11) of the Lease, we need not evaluate\nTenant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support its legal conclusion that\nTenant also violated Section K (10) of the Lease. Nevertheless, we note that Section K (10) does\nnot clearly establish whether all off-premises criminal activity or only off-premises drug-related\ncriminal activity violates the Lease.\n\n\n                                               11\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nHousing Authority of the County of    :\nArmstrong                             :\n                                      :\n          v.                          : No. 1413 C.D. 2022\n                                      :\nJoseph S.

The Rubinoffs contend the Foundation was\n\fnot entitled to fees and costs, or, alternatively, should have received fees and costs\nin a lesser amount. In addition, the Rubinoffs contend the orphans\u2019 court judge\ndisplayed bias against them and should have recused himself. H. William Doring\n(Doring), Thomas J. Balestrieri (Balestrieri), Joseph M. Jackovic (Jackovic), and the\nFoundation (collectively, Directors) appeal from the same order, but maintain the\norphans\u2019 court should have awarded the full amount of fees and costs they requested,\ntotaling approximately $1.5 million. After review, we reverse the award of fees and\ncosts but conclude the Rubinoffs failed to preserve their allegations of bias.1\n                                       I. Background\n       We detailed the extensive history of this case in a prior decision, In Re: Jack\nBuncher Foundation (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 306 C.D. 2019, filed July 1, 2020). Briefly,\nthe Foundation is a charitable nonprofit corporation named for prominent Pittsburgh\nbusinessman Jack Buncher (Jack). Jack had two children, Bernita Buncher (Bernita)\nand Stephen Buncher. The Rubinoffs are Bernita\u2019s children. Jack and several family\nmembers, including Bernita, formed the Foundation in 1974. Jack died in 2001. The\nFoundation\u2019s Board of Directors subsequently amended the articles of incorporation\nand bylaws in 2011 (2011 articles and bylaws). At the time of the amendments, the\nBoard of Directors included Bernita, Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic.\n       On April 12, 2017, the Rubinoffs filed a petition for rule to show cause.2 The\nRubinoffs alleged Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic exercised undue influence over\nBernita and breached their fiduciary duties by adopting the 2011 articles and bylaws.\nAmong other things, the Rubinoffs alleged the 2011 articles and bylaws contravened\n\n1\n The Commonwealth, through its counsel, the Office of Attorney General, filed a statement in this\nCourt indicating it would not be taking a position in these cross-appeals.\n\n2\n  The Rubinoffs initially filed a complaint in the Civil Division on July 26, 2016. The matter was\ntransferred to the orphans\u2019 court, where the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fJack\u2019s intent because they eliminated the right of his decedents to serve on the Board\nof Directors and redirected the Foundation\u2019s assets to causes he did not support. The\nRubinoffs requested the orphans\u2019 court declare the 2011 articles and bylaws invalid;\nreinstate prior versions of the articles and bylaws; remove Balestrieri, Doring, and\nJackovic from the Board of Directors; appoint one of the Rubinoffs to the Board of\nDirectors; and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n         The Directors filed an answer and new matter on May 8, 2017, in which they\ndenied the Rubinoffs\u2019 allegations and included their own request for attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. The Directors based their request on Count III of the petition for rule to\nshow cause, which the Rubinoffs brought \u201cderivatively on behalf of the Foundation\nand individually as presumptive directors\u201d against Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic\nunder Section 5782 of the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988 (Law), 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n5782. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 201a-02a (unnecessary capitalization omitted).\nThe Directors contended the Rubinoffs lacked standing to bring a derivative claim\nbecause they were not and never had been \u201cmembers\u201d of the Foundation as Section\n5782 required.3 Additionally, the Directors argued the Rubinoffs failed to comply\n\n3\n    The Law defines a \u201cmember\u201d as any of the following:\n\n         (1) A person that has voting rights in a membership corporation.\n\n         (2) When used in relation to the taking of corporate action by a membership\n         corporation, a delegate to a convention or assembly of delegates of members\n         established pursuant to any provision of this subpart who has the right to vote at the\n         convention or assembly in accordance with the rules of the convention or\n         assembly.\n\n         (3) A person that has been given voting rights or other membership rights in a\n         membership corporation by a bylaw adopted by the members pursuant to section\n         5770 (relating to voting powers and other rights of certain securityholders and other\n         entities) or other provision of law, but only to the extent of those rights.\n(Footnote continued on next page\u2026)\n\n                                                   3\n\fwith Section 5782(c), which required them to post security for reasonable expenses,\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees, that the Foundation might incur. The Rubinoffs filed a\nreply and answer to new matter on May 19, 2017. The Rubinoffs asserted they had\nstanding to pursue a claim under Section 5782 but denied it was necessary for them\nto post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d Reply to Answer\nand New Matter, 5/19/17, \u00b6 3.4\n       On May 31, 2017, counsel for the Rubinoffs, William Pietragallo, II, Esquire\n(Pietragallo), e-mailed counsel for the Directors, Joseph F. McDonough, Esquire\n(McDonough), to propose a \u201ccompromise.\u201d R.R. at 20a. Pietragallo explained the\nRubinoffs would provide him with $100,000 to be deposited in an interest-bearing\naccount, as security for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter an [o]rder\nawarding [attorneys\u2019] fees to [the Directors] and after any final appeal thereof.\u201d Id.\nMcDonough agreed to the compromise, proposing the Rubinoffs make their deposit\n\u201cwithout prejudice to [Pietragallo\u2019s] position that no fees/expenses are recoverable\nand also without prejudice to [McDonough\u2019s] position that they are recoverable in\nan amount (whether more or less than the $100,000 deposit) to be determined by\nfinal [c]ourt [o]rder including available appeals.\u201d Id. at 21a.\n       The parties memorialized the compromise in a letter signed by Pietragallo and\nMcDonough and dated June 1, 2017. In the letter, Pietragallo explains:\n\n            Our law firm will establish an escrow account in the principal\n       sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) for the purpose of\n\n\n       (4) A shareholder of a corporation, if the corporation issues shares of stock.\n\nSection 5103(a) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103(a).\n\n4\n  Some of the Rubinoffs\u2019 pleadings, including their reply and answer to new matter, do not appear\nin the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f      providing security for any claim that the [Directors] may have\n      regarding attorneys\u2019 fees . . . should [the Directors] be awarded any\n      such attorneys\u2019 fees by the [c]ourt and, if appealed, sustained by a final\n      order of an appellate court.\n\nR.R. at 23a.\n      Moreover, a stipulated case management order, dated June 20, 2017, explains\nthe compromise as follows:\n\n      On or before June 15, 2017, counsel for [the Rubinoffs] will confirm to\n      counsel for [the Directors] in writing that [the Rubinoffs] have\n      deposited with counsel for [the Rubinoffs] the sum of $100,000 to be\n      held by counsel for [the Rubinoffs] in an interest-bearing account as\n      payment for counsel fees should the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter a final\n      [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section]\n      5782(c) or otherwise[.]\n\nR.R. at 26a.\n      The proceedings culminated in a nine-day hearing beginning July 9, 2018, and\nending July 19, 2018. By order dated February 12, 2019, the orphans\u2019 court denied\nthe Rubinoffs\u2019 requested relief while reserving the Directors\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. The orphans\u2019 court found the Directors did not exert undue influence\nover Bernita or breach their fiduciary duties when they adopted the 2011 articles and\nbylaws. The Rubinoffs appealed, and this Court affirmed on July 1, 2020. See Jack\nBuncher Foundation. The Rubinoffs filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which\nour Supreme Court denied on January 5, 2021.\n      Shortly thereafter, on March 19, 2021, the Directors filed a petition requesting\nnearly $1.5 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Directors once again relied on\nCount III of the petition for rule to show cause and Section 5782(c) of the Law. The\nDirectors averred they took a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d to the underlying litigation and\nsought to bring the dispute to a prompt conclusion while minimizing expenses. R.R.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fat 12a. They contrasted this with the Rubinoffs\u2019 \u201ccontumacious behavior,\u201d which\nincluded lengthy and unnecessary pleadings and discovery requests. Id. at 16a.\n       The Rubinoffs filed an answer and new matter on April 8, 2021. They argued\nSection 5782(c) did not permit the Directors to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In\nthe alternative, they argued any award should be limited to the $100,000 deposited\nunder the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017. The Rubinoffs averred they had already sent\na check for $101,869.58 to the Foundation \u201cnot because [the Rubinoffs] believed the\nFoundation was entitled to this amount, but because [they] thought it better that such\nsum went to charity rather than to counsel from both sides in a senseless fight over\nfees that are simply not due.\u201d Answer and New Matter, 4/8/21, \u00b6 47. The Rubinoffs\nnoted only Count III of their petition for rule to show cause was a derivative claim,\nand the underlying litigation was essentially a direct action.5\n       The orphans\u2019 court conducted a hearing on November 9, 2021. By order dated\nJanuary 28, 2022, the orphans\u2019 court directed the Rubinoffs to increase their posted\nsecurity to $500,000, which the Directors would be entitled to recover. The orphans\u2019\ncourt found the Foundation does not have any \u201cmembers\u201d under Section 5782. R.R.\nat 207a. The orphans\u2019 court concluded, despite this, that the parties agreed Section\n5782 permitted a nonprofit corporation to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred\nwhen successfully defending an action against itself or its directors. Id. at 209a. The\norphans\u2019 court acknowledged the Rubinoffs did not challenge the reasonableness of\nthe Directors\u2019 fees and costs, but it concluded the $1.5 million request was excessive,\nciting \u201cnumerous instances of duplicative billing, frequent \u2018revising,\u2019 and countless\nconferences between counsel in the same firm.\u201d Id. at 211a. The Rubinoffs\u2019 pursuit\n\n5\n The Directors filed a reply on April 13, 2021, and denied the averments in the Rubinoffs\u2019 new\nmatter. The Rubinoffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on May 28, 2021, which the\norphans\u2019 court denied by order dated July 27, 2021.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fof the litigation was not frivolous, the orphans\u2019 court noted, and necessarily involved\nextensive discovery. Id.\n       The Rubinoffs appealed to this Court, and the Directors cross-appealed.6 Both\nsets of parties challenged the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, with the Rubinoffs\narguing the Directors were not entitled to fees and costs, or, in the alternative, should\nhave received a lesser award, and the Directors arguing they should have received\nthe full amount of fees and costs requested. Moreover, the Rubinoffs raised a new\nclaim in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, maintaining the\norphans\u2019 court judge displayed bias against them and should have recused himself.\nThe orphans\u2019 court responded with an additional opinion, emphasizing the Rubinoffs\nnever alleged bias or requested recusal. It further emphasized its \u201cpatient[]\u201d conduct\nof the underlying litigation, which included numerous conferences and motions, and\na nine-day hearing. R.R. at 221a.\n                               II. Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\n       We begin our analysis with the Rubinoffs\u2019 challenge to the award of attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Primarily, this challenge requires us to consider whether the orphans\u2019\ncourt correctly interpreted Section 5782(c) of the Law. This is a question of law, for\nwhich our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Meyer\nv. Cmty. Coll. of Beaver Cnty., 93 A.3d 806, 813 (Pa. 2014) (citing Dechert LLP v.\nCommonwealth, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (Pa. 2010)). Stated differently, we do not defer\nto the orphans\u2019 court when reaching a decision, and we may review the entire record\non appeal. Mercury Trucking, Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 55 A.3d 1056, 1082\n\n\n6\n The Rubinoffs purport to challenge not only the January 28, 2022 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs order,\nbut also orders entered as part of the underlying litigation. See Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 2-3. This Court\nhas already heard an appeal from, and affirmed, the order resolving the underlying litigation, see\nJack Buncher Foundation, and only the January 28, 2022 order is properly before us.\n\n\n                                                7\n\f(Pa. 2012) (citing Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole),\n860 A.2d 25, 29 n.2 (Pa. 2004)).\n      Our research has revealed no prior decisions interpreting Section 5782(c). At\nthe time the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause in the orphans\u2019 court,\nSection 5782(a)-(c) provided as follows:\n\n      (a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action\n      or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one\n      or more members of a nonprofit corporation against any present or\n      former officer, director or member of an other body of the corporation\n      because the corporation refuses to enforce rights that may properly be\n      asserted by it, each plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear\n      that each plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the\n      transaction of which he complains.\n\n      (b) Exception.--Any member who, except for the provisions of\n      subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding\n      and who does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the\n      discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding\n      on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such\n      verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court,\n      that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on\n      behalf of the corporation and that without the action serious injustice\n      will result.\n\n      (c) Security for costs.--In any action or proceeding instituted or\n      maintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5%\n      of the members of any class of the corporation, the corporation in whose\n      right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage\n      of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the\n      reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by\n      the corporation in connection therewith or for which it may become\n      liable pursuant to section 5743 (relating to mandatory indemnification),\n      but only insofar as relates to actions by or in the right of the corporation,\n      to which security the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as\n      the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding.\n      The amount of security may from time to time be increased or\n      decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security\n      provided has or is likely to become inadequate or excessive. The\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an\n       evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious\n       injustice would result.\n\n15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782 (a)-(c).7\n       Section 5751(a) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5751(a), contemplates that members\nof a nonprofit corporation will be organized into \u201cclasses.\u201d It provides:\n\n       (a) General rule.--Membership in a nonprofit corporation shall be of\n       the classes, and shall be governed by the rules of admission, retention,\n       suspension and expulsion, prescribed in bylaws adopted by the\n       members, except that the rules shall be reasonable, germane to the\n       purpose or purposes of the corporation and equally enforced as to all\n       members of the same class. Unless otherwise provided by a bylaw\n       adopted by the members:\n\n              (1) There shall be one class of members whose voting and\n              other rights and interests shall be equal.\n\n              (2) If there is only one class of members, the members\n              shall have all the rights of members generally in a\n              nonprofit corporation.\n\nId.\nA. The Rubinoffs\u2019 arguments\n       The Rubinoffs maintain Section 5782 of the Law did not permit the orphans\u2019\ncourt to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them. Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 35-49. They\ncontend Section 5782 applies to \u201cmembers\u201d of a nonprofit corporation, which they\nare not. Id. at 44-49. The Rubinoffs deny they ever admitted Section 5782 permits\nan award against them and insist they challenged this during the proceedings below.\nId. at 35-38. They also emphasize Section 5782 applies to derivative claims, rather\n\n\n7\n The General Assembly amended Section 5782 after the orphans\u2019 court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. See Act of November 3, 2022, P.L. 1791. The amendment did not change the language\nof Section 5782 in a way that would have affected the outcome of the parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n\n                                             9\n\fthan direct claims. Id. at 44-45, 52-57. The Rubinoffs contend only one-half of one\nof the counts in the petition for rule to show cause was derivative, and the gravamen\nof their action was to recover for direct harm. Id. The Rubinoffs argue, to the extent\nthey must pay fees and costs, that they should pay 7.14% of the Directors\u2019 requested\naward, or $107,643.65, because only 7.14% of their total claims were derivative. Id.\nat 44-45, 57.\n      The Rubinoffs note, alternatively, that Section 5782(c) applies to \u201cmembers\nof any class.\u201d Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 49-52 (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). They describe\nthemselves as comprising nearly half of the \u201cclass\u201d of Jack\u2019s descendants, including\nBernita\u2019s grandchildren. Id. Therefore, they argue their action was not brought \u201cby\nless than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the members of any class\nof the corporation.\u201d Id. (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). The Rubinoffs propose the\nparties agreed to limit the potential attorneys\u2019 fees and costs awarded to the $100,000\nsecurity they posted during the underlying litigation. Id. at 28-29, 45.\nB. The Directors\u2019 arguments\n      The Directors contend Section 5782 applies because the Rubinoffs relied on\nit during the underlying litigation and raised derivative claims. Directors\u2019 Reply Br.\nat 18-34. The Directors also cite the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017, under which the\nRubinoffs agreed to post security while the litigation was pending. Id. The Directors\nmaintain Section 5782(c) specifies the minimum number of \u201cmembers\u201d that a group\nof plaintiffs or petitioners must have in order to be excused from paying attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Id. at 20-32. Because the Foundation has no members, the Directors\ncontend the Rubinoffs cannot meet Section 5782(c)\u2019s threshold. Id. at 25-32.\n      Additionally, the Directors challenge the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\nthe orphans\u2019 court awarded. Directors\u2019 Br. at 14-26. They argue the orphans\u2019 court\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fshould have awarded the $1.5 million they requested, rather than $500,000. Id. The\nDirectors defend the reasonableness of their $1.5 million request, characterizing the\nRubinoffs\u2019 approach to the underlying litigation as \u201caggressive.\u201d Id. at 16-19. The\nDirectors argue the Rubinoffs did not contest the reasonableness of the fees and costs\nincurred. Id. at 16-24. They acknowledge the orphans\u2019 court deemed some fees and\ncosts excessive but insist it failed to sufficiently explain how it arrived at a $500,000\nfigure. Id. at 15, 21-26. The Directors contend the belief that the Rubinoffs\u2019 petition\nfor rule to show cause was not frivolous does not justify a smaller award of fees and\ncosts. Id. at 14-15, 20.\nC. Analysis\n      Section 5782(c) of the Law applies to \u201cany action or proceeding instituted or\nmaintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the\nmembers of any class of the corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c) (emphasis added).\nThe orphans\u2019 court and the parties agree the Rubinoffs are not members, and, in fact,\nthe Foundation has no members. Accordingly, Section 5782(c) does not permit an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them.\n      Although the Directors contend Section 5782(c) sets a minimum threshold of\nmembers that plaintiffs must have to avoid paying attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, their\nargument is contrary to the remainder of the section. Section 5782(a) applies to \u201cany\naction or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more\nmembers of a nonprofit corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(a) (emphasis added). It\nexpressly requires that \u201ceach plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear that\neach plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the transaction of\nwhich he complains.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Section 5782(b) supplies an exception\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fto this rule, but it applies only to \u201c[a]ny member\u201d who fails to meet the requirements\nof Section 5782(a). 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(b) (emphasis added).\n      Moreover, our review of the record does not indicate the Rubinoffs \u201cagreed\u201d\nto pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Rubinoffs cited Section 5782 in Count III of\ntheir petition for rule to show cause. The Directors filed an answer and new matter,\ncontending the Rubinoffs lacked standing under Section 5782 because they were not\nmembers of the Foundation. Nonetheless, the Directors maintained the Rubinoffs\nfailed to post security as required under Section 5782(c). The Rubinoffs filed a reply\nand answer to new matter arguing they had standing under Section 5782 but denying\nit was necessary to post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d\nReply to Answer and New Matter, 5/19/17, \u00b6 3.\n      The parties reached a compromise, which they memorialized with a letter and\nstipulated case management order. R.R. at 23a-26a. Neither the letter nor the order,\nhowever, guaranteed the Rubinoffs would pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if they were\nunsuccessful in the underlying litigation. The letter stated the Directors \u201cmay have\u201d\na claim for fees and costs, while the order applied \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter\na final [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section] 5782(c) or\notherwise[.]\u201d Id.\n      When the Directors filed their petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, they based\ntheir request on the letter and stipulated case management order. The Directors also\nattached a copy of McDonough\u2019s e-mail to Pietragallo, recognizing the Rubinoffs\nwould make a deposit \u201cwithout prejudice to [their] position that no fees/expenses\nare recoverable.\u201d R.R. at 21a (emphasis added). The relevant testimony during the\nhearing on November 9, 2021, focused on the circumstances surrounding the letter,\nthe order, and counsels\u2019 e-mails.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      We recognize the inconsistency of the Rubinoffs\u2019 litigation positions in this\nmatter, which included citing Section 5782 of the Law when it suited them and then\ncontending Section 5782(c) did not apply. Section 5782(a) should have prevented\nthis problem by prohibiting the Rubinoffs from bringing a derivative action if they\nwere not members of the Foundation. Neither the plain language of Section 5782(c),\nnor the parties\u2019 compromise, permitted the orphans\u2019 court to award attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs against individuals who were never members and who could not bring a\nderivative action in the first place. Therefore, we reverse the January 28, 2022 order\nand $500,000 award of fees and costs.\n                         III. Alleged Orphans\u2019 Court Bias\n      Issues not raised in the orphans\u2019 court are waived and cannot be raised for the\nfirst time on appeal. Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 302(a), Pa.R.A.P.\n302(a). Additionally, any party requesting the recusal or disqualification of a judge\nmust \u201craise the objection at the earliest possible moment, or that party will suffer the\nconsequence of being time barred.\u201d Lomas v. Kravitz, 170 A.3d 380, 389 (Pa. 2017)\n(quoting Goodheart v. Casey, 565 A.2d 757, 763 (Pa. 1989)). If a party discovers\nalleged evidence of bias after a case is over, he or she must establish \u201c1) the evidence\ncould not have been brought to the attention of the [orphans\u2019] court in the exercise\nof due diligence, and 2) that the existence of the evidence would have compelled a\ndifferent result in the case.\u201d Reilly v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 489 A.2d 1291, 1301\n(Pa. 1985).\n      Here, the Rubinoffs concede they did not request the orphans\u2019 court judge\u2019s\nrecusal before he ruled on the merits of the underlying litigation and issued the order\nawarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Rubinoffs\u2019 Reply Br. at 8-9. They instead argue\nthey raised the issue \u201cat the first opportunity to do so following the final [o]rder\u201d by\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fincluding it in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. Rubinoffs\u2019\nReply Br. at 8-9. We cannot accept the Rubinoffs\u2019 explanation. In their brief, the\nRubinoffs allege 12 \u201cegregious examples\u201d of bias, but 8 of those examples involve\ndecisions and statements the judge made in the underlying litigation. See Rubinoffs\u2019\nBr. at 35, 60-67. If the judge\u2019s decisions and statements were as \u201cegregious\u201d as the\nRubinoffs suggest, they had every opportunity to seek recusal earlier. Accordingly,\nthe Rubinoffs failed to preserve their claim of bias for our review.\n      Even reaching the merits of the Rubinoffs\u2019 argument, our review of the record\ndoes not show the orphans\u2019 court judge was biased against them. Recusal decisions\nare within the sound discretion of the judge whose recusal is sought. Dunn v. Bd. of\nProp. Assessment, Appeals & Rev., 877 A.2d 504, 517 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005) (citing\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 732 A.2d 1167 (Pa. 1999)). As our Supreme Court has\nexplained, \u201ceach judge has the primary responsibility for determining the validity of\na challenge to his or her participation in a given matter. . . . [T]he jurist requested to\nrecuse himself is the most capable to determine those factors hidden in the recesses\nof the mind and soul . . . .\u201d Goodheart, 565 A.2d at 763 (citations omitted).\n      The Rubinoffs\u2019 allegations are primarily an attempt to relitigate the orphans\u2019\ncourt ruling on the merits. Several examples of alleged bias challenge the conclusion\nthat Bernita was mentally competent when the Board of Directors adopted the 2011\narticles and bylaws. The Rubinoffs maintain the orphans\u2019 court \u201cignored\u201d Bernita\u2019s\nmental health diagnoses, Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 65, although the orphans\u2019 court discussed\nBernita\u2019s mental health at length in its opinions, see Orphans\u2019 Ct. Op., 2/12/19, at\n11-14; Orphans\u2019 Ct. Op., 4/23/19, at 4-7. Strikingly, the Rubinoffs present the award\nof attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them as four separate examples of bias, with each\nexample focusing on a different statement the orphans\u2019 court made or failed to make\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fin its opinions. Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 60-62. We agree the orphans\u2019 court misinterpreted\nSection 5782(c) of the Law and erred by awarding fees and costs. At the same time,\nthe orphans\u2019 court reduced the amount of fees and costs that the Rubinoffs would be\nrequired to pay, demonstrating an effort to treat both sets of parties fairly.\n                                   IV. Conclusion\n      For all the foregoing reasons, the orphans\u2019 court erred by awarding attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs to the Directors under Section 5782(c), and we reverse the orphans\u2019\ncourt order dated January 28, 2022. The Directors shall return any attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs already paid under the January 28, 2022 order within 30 days of the date\nof the attached order. The Rubinoffs failed to preserve their claim of orphans\u2019 court\nbias by not raising it sooner. Even reaching the merits of their claim, the Rubinoffs\nwould not be entitled to relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                               ______________________________\n                                               STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f          IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nIn re: Jack Buncher Foundation            : CASES CONSOLIDATED\n                                          :\nAppeal of: Amy Rubinoff, Caryn            :\nRubinoff, Michael Rubinoff, and           :\nDaniel Rubinoff                           : No. 291 C.D. 2022\n                                          :\n                                          :\nIn Re: Jack Buncher Foundation            :\n                                          :\nAppeal of: H.

The Rubinoffs contend the Foundation was\n\fnot entitled to fees and costs, or, alternatively, should have received fees and costs\nin a lesser amount. In addition, the Rubinoffs contend the orphans\u2019 court judge\ndisplayed bias against them and should have recused himself. H. William Doring\n(Doring), Thomas J. Balestrieri (Balestrieri), Joseph M. Jackovic (Jackovic), and the\nFoundation (collectively, Directors) appeal from the same order, but maintain the\norphans\u2019 court should have awarded the full amount of fees and costs they requested,\ntotaling approximately $1.5 million. After review, we reverse the award of fees and\ncosts but conclude the Rubinoffs failed to preserve their allegations of bias.1\n                                       I. Background\n       We detailed the extensive history of this case in a prior decision, In Re: Jack\nBuncher Foundation (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 306 C.D. 2019, filed July 1, 2020). Briefly,\nthe Foundation is a charitable nonprofit corporation named for prominent Pittsburgh\nbusinessman Jack Buncher (Jack). Jack had two children, Bernita Buncher (Bernita)\nand Stephen Buncher. The Rubinoffs are Bernita\u2019s children. Jack and several family\nmembers, including Bernita, formed the Foundation in 1974. Jack died in 2001. The\nFoundation\u2019s Board of Directors subsequently amended the articles of incorporation\nand bylaws in 2011 (2011 articles and bylaws). At the time of the amendments, the\nBoard of Directors included Bernita, Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic.\n       On April 12, 2017, the Rubinoffs filed a petition for rule to show cause.2 The\nRubinoffs alleged Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic exercised undue influence over\nBernita and breached their fiduciary duties by adopting the 2011 articles and bylaws.\nAmong other things, the Rubinoffs alleged the 2011 articles and bylaws contravened\n\n1\n The Commonwealth, through its counsel, the Office of Attorney General, filed a statement in this\nCourt indicating it would not be taking a position in these cross-appeals.\n\n2\n  The Rubinoffs initially filed a complaint in the Civil Division on July 26, 2016. The matter was\ntransferred to the orphans\u2019 court, where the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fJack\u2019s intent because they eliminated the right of his decedents to serve on the Board\nof Directors and redirected the Foundation\u2019s assets to causes he did not support. The\nRubinoffs requested the orphans\u2019 court declare the 2011 articles and bylaws invalid;\nreinstate prior versions of the articles and bylaws; remove Balestrieri, Doring, and\nJackovic from the Board of Directors; appoint one of the Rubinoffs to the Board of\nDirectors; and award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n         The Directors filed an answer and new matter on May 8, 2017, in which they\ndenied the Rubinoffs\u2019 allegations and included their own request for attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. The Directors based their request on Count III of the petition for rule to\nshow cause, which the Rubinoffs brought \u201cderivatively on behalf of the Foundation\nand individually as presumptive directors\u201d against Balestrieri, Doring, and Jackovic\nunder Section 5782 of the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988 (Law), 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n5782. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 201a-02a (unnecessary capitalization omitted).\nThe Directors contended the Rubinoffs lacked standing to bring a derivative claim\nbecause they were not and never had been \u201cmembers\u201d of the Foundation as Section\n5782 required.3 Additionally, the Directors argued the Rubinoffs failed to comply\n\n3\n    The Law defines a \u201cmember\u201d as any of the following:\n\n         (1) A person that has voting rights in a membership corporation.\n\n         (2) When used in relation to the taking of corporate action by a membership\n         corporation, a delegate to a convention or assembly of delegates of members\n         established pursuant to any provision of this subpart who has the right to vote at the\n         convention or assembly in accordance with the rules of the convention or\n         assembly.\n\n         (3) A person that has been given voting rights or other membership rights in a\n         membership corporation by a bylaw adopted by the members pursuant to section\n         5770 (relating to voting powers and other rights of certain securityholders and other\n         entities) or other provision of law, but only to the extent of those rights.\n(Footnote continued on next page\u2026)\n\n                                                   3\n\fwith Section 5782(c), which required them to post security for reasonable expenses,\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees, that the Foundation might incur. The Rubinoffs filed a\nreply and answer to new matter on May 19, 2017. The Rubinoffs asserted they had\nstanding to pursue a claim under Section 5782 but denied it was necessary for them\nto post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d Reply to Answer\nand New Matter, 5/19/17, \u00b6 3.4\n       On May 31, 2017, counsel for the Rubinoffs, William Pietragallo, II, Esquire\n(Pietragallo), e-mailed counsel for the Directors, Joseph F. McDonough, Esquire\n(McDonough), to propose a \u201ccompromise.\u201d R.R. at 20a. Pietragallo explained the\nRubinoffs would provide him with $100,000 to be deposited in an interest-bearing\naccount, as security for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter an [o]rder\nawarding [attorneys\u2019] fees to [the Directors] and after any final appeal thereof.\u201d Id.\nMcDonough agreed to the compromise, proposing the Rubinoffs make their deposit\n\u201cwithout prejudice to [Pietragallo\u2019s] position that no fees/expenses are recoverable\nand also without prejudice to [McDonough\u2019s] position that they are recoverable in\nan amount (whether more or less than the $100,000 deposit) to be determined by\nfinal [c]ourt [o]rder including available appeals.\u201d Id. at 21a.\n       The parties memorialized the compromise in a letter signed by Pietragallo and\nMcDonough and dated June 1, 2017. In the letter, Pietragallo explains:\n\n            Our law firm will establish an escrow account in the principal\n       sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) for the purpose of\n\n\n       (4) A shareholder of a corporation, if the corporation issues shares of stock.\n\nSection 5103(a) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103(a).\n\n4\n  Some of the Rubinoffs\u2019 pleadings, including their reply and answer to new matter, do not appear\nin the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f      providing security for any claim that the [Directors] may have\n      regarding attorneys\u2019 fees . . . should [the Directors] be awarded any\n      such attorneys\u2019 fees by the [c]ourt and, if appealed, sustained by a final\n      order of an appellate court.\n\nR.R. at 23a.\n      Moreover, a stipulated case management order, dated June 20, 2017, explains\nthe compromise as follows:\n\n      On or before June 15, 2017, counsel for [the Rubinoffs] will confirm to\n      counsel for [the Directors] in writing that [the Rubinoffs] have\n      deposited with counsel for [the Rubinoffs] the sum of $100,000 to be\n      held by counsel for [the Rubinoffs] in an interest-bearing account as\n      payment for counsel fees should the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter a final\n      [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section]\n      5782(c) or otherwise[.]\n\nR.R. at 26a.\n      The proceedings culminated in a nine-day hearing beginning July 9, 2018, and\nending July 19, 2018. By order dated February 12, 2019, the orphans\u2019 court denied\nthe Rubinoffs\u2019 requested relief while reserving the Directors\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. The orphans\u2019 court found the Directors did not exert undue influence\nover Bernita or breach their fiduciary duties when they adopted the 2011 articles and\nbylaws. The Rubinoffs appealed, and this Court affirmed on July 1, 2020. See Jack\nBuncher Foundation. The Rubinoffs filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which\nour Supreme Court denied on January 5, 2021.\n      Shortly thereafter, on March 19, 2021, the Directors filed a petition requesting\nnearly $1.5 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Directors once again relied on\nCount III of the petition for rule to show cause and Section 5782(c) of the Law. The\nDirectors averred they took a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d to the underlying litigation and\nsought to bring the dispute to a prompt conclusion while minimizing expenses. R.R.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fat 12a. They contrasted this with the Rubinoffs\u2019 \u201ccontumacious behavior,\u201d which\nincluded lengthy and unnecessary pleadings and discovery requests. Id. at 16a.\n       The Rubinoffs filed an answer and new matter on April 8, 2021. They argued\nSection 5782(c) did not permit the Directors to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In\nthe alternative, they argued any award should be limited to the $100,000 deposited\nunder the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017. The Rubinoffs averred they had already sent\na check for $101,869.58 to the Foundation \u201cnot because [the Rubinoffs] believed the\nFoundation was entitled to this amount, but because [they] thought it better that such\nsum went to charity rather than to counsel from both sides in a senseless fight over\nfees that are simply not due.\u201d Answer and New Matter, 4/8/21, \u00b6 47. The Rubinoffs\nnoted only Count III of their petition for rule to show cause was a derivative claim,\nand the underlying litigation was essentially a direct action.5\n       The orphans\u2019 court conducted a hearing on November 9, 2021. By order dated\nJanuary 28, 2022, the orphans\u2019 court directed the Rubinoffs to increase their posted\nsecurity to $500,000, which the Directors would be entitled to recover. The orphans\u2019\ncourt found the Foundation does not have any \u201cmembers\u201d under Section 5782. R.R.\nat 207a. The orphans\u2019 court concluded, despite this, that the parties agreed Section\n5782 permitted a nonprofit corporation to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred\nwhen successfully defending an action against itself or its directors. Id. at 209a. The\norphans\u2019 court acknowledged the Rubinoffs did not challenge the reasonableness of\nthe Directors\u2019 fees and costs, but it concluded the $1.5 million request was excessive,\nciting \u201cnumerous instances of duplicative billing, frequent \u2018revising,\u2019 and countless\nconferences between counsel in the same firm.\u201d Id. at 211a. The Rubinoffs\u2019 pursuit\n\n5\n The Directors filed a reply on April 13, 2021, and denied the averments in the Rubinoffs\u2019 new\nmatter. The Rubinoffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on May 28, 2021, which the\norphans\u2019 court denied by order dated July 27, 2021.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fof the litigation was not frivolous, the orphans\u2019 court noted, and necessarily involved\nextensive discovery. Id.\n       The Rubinoffs appealed to this Court, and the Directors cross-appealed.6 Both\nsets of parties challenged the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, with the Rubinoffs\narguing the Directors were not entitled to fees and costs, or, in the alternative, should\nhave received a lesser award, and the Directors arguing they should have received\nthe full amount of fees and costs requested. Moreover, the Rubinoffs raised a new\nclaim in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, maintaining the\norphans\u2019 court judge displayed bias against them and should have recused himself.\nThe orphans\u2019 court responded with an additional opinion, emphasizing the Rubinoffs\nnever alleged bias or requested recusal. It further emphasized its \u201cpatient[]\u201d conduct\nof the underlying litigation, which included numerous conferences and motions, and\na nine-day hearing. R.R. at 221a.\n                               II. Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\n       We begin our analysis with the Rubinoffs\u2019 challenge to the award of attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Primarily, this challenge requires us to consider whether the orphans\u2019\ncourt correctly interpreted Section 5782(c) of the Law. This is a question of law, for\nwhich our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Meyer\nv. Cmty.

This Court\nhas already heard an appeal from, and affirmed, the order resolving the underlying litigation, see\nJack Buncher Foundation, and only the January 28, 2022 order is properly before us.\n\n\n                                                7\n\f(Pa. 2012) (citing Heath v.

At\nthe time the Rubinoffs filed the petition for rule to show cause in the orphans\u2019 court,\nSection 5782(a)-(c) provided as follows:\n\n      (a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action\n      or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one\n      or more members of a nonprofit corporation against any present or\n      former officer, director or member of an other body of the corporation\n      because the corporation refuses to enforce rights that may properly be\n      asserted by it, each plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear\n      that each plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the\n      transaction of which he complains.\n\n      (b) Exception.--Any member who, except for the provisions of\n      subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding\n      and who does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the\n      discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding\n      on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such\n      verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court,\n      that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on\n      behalf of the corporation and that without the action serious injustice\n      will result.\n\n      (c) Security for costs.--In any action or proceeding instituted or\n      maintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5%\n      of the members of any class of the corporation, the corporation in whose\n      right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage\n      of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the\n      reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by\n      the corporation in connection therewith or for which it may become\n      liable pursuant to section 5743 (relating to mandatory indemnification),\n      but only insofar as relates to actions by or in the right of the corporation,\n      to which security the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as\n      the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding.\n      The amount of security may from time to time be increased or\n      decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security\n      provided has or is likely to become inadequate or excessive.

Unless otherwise provided by a bylaw\n       adopted by the members:\n\n              (1) There shall be one class of members whose voting and\n              other rights and interests shall be equal.\n\n              (2) If there is only one class of members, the members\n              shall have all the rights of members generally in a\n              nonprofit corporation.\n\nId.\nA. The Rubinoffs\u2019 arguments\n       The Rubinoffs maintain Section 5782 of the Law did not permit the orphans\u2019\ncourt to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them. Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 35-49. They\ncontend Section 5782 applies to \u201cmembers\u201d of a nonprofit corporation, which they\nare not. Id. at 44-49. The Rubinoffs deny they ever admitted Section 5782 permits\nan award against them and insist they challenged this during the proceedings below.\nId. at 35-38. They also emphasize Section 5782 applies to derivative claims, rather\n\n\n7\n The General Assembly amended Section 5782 after the orphans\u2019 court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs. See Act of November 3, 2022, P.L. 1791. The amendment did not change the language\nof Section 5782 in a way that would have affected the outcome of the parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n\n                                             9\n\fthan direct claims. Id. at 44-45, 52-57. The Rubinoffs contend only one-half of one\nof the counts in the petition for rule to show cause was derivative, and the gravamen\nof their action was to recover for direct harm. Id. The Rubinoffs argue, to the extent\nthey must pay fees and costs, that they should pay 7.14% of the Directors\u2019 requested\naward, or $107,643.65, because only 7.14% of their total claims were derivative. Id.\nat 44-45, 57.\n      The Rubinoffs note, alternatively, that Section 5782(c) applies to \u201cmembers\nof any class.\u201d Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 49-52 (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). They describe\nthemselves as comprising nearly half of the \u201cclass\u201d of Jack\u2019s descendants, including\nBernita\u2019s grandchildren. Id. Therefore, they argue their action was not brought \u201cby\nless than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the members of any class\nof the corporation.\u201d Id. (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c)). The Rubinoffs propose the\nparties agreed to limit the potential attorneys\u2019 fees and costs awarded to the $100,000\nsecurity they posted during the underlying litigation. Id. at 28-29, 45.\nB. The Directors\u2019 arguments\n      The Directors contend Section 5782 applies because the Rubinoffs relied on\nit during the underlying litigation and raised derivative claims. Directors\u2019 Reply Br.\nat 18-34. The Directors also cite the parties\u2019 compromise in 2017, under which the\nRubinoffs agreed to post security while the litigation was pending. Id. The Directors\nmaintain Section 5782(c) specifies the minimum number of \u201cmembers\u201d that a group\nof plaintiffs or petitioners must have in order to be excused from paying attorneys\u2019\nfees and costs. Id. at 20-32. Because the Foundation has no members, the Directors\ncontend the Rubinoffs cannot meet Section 5782(c)\u2019s threshold. Id. at 25-32.\n      Additionally, the Directors challenge the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\nthe orphans\u2019 court awarded. Directors\u2019 Br. at 14-26. They argue the orphans\u2019 court\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fshould have awarded the $1.5 million they requested, rather than $500,000. Id. The\nDirectors defend the reasonableness of their $1.5 million request, characterizing the\nRubinoffs\u2019 approach to the underlying litigation as \u201caggressive.\u201d Id. at 16-19. The\nDirectors argue the Rubinoffs did not contest the reasonableness of the fees and costs\nincurred. Id. at 16-24. They acknowledge the orphans\u2019 court deemed some fees and\ncosts excessive but insist it failed to sufficiently explain how it arrived at a $500,000\nfigure. Id. at 15, 21-26. The Directors contend the belief that the Rubinoffs\u2019 petition\nfor rule to show cause was not frivolous does not justify a smaller award of fees and\ncosts. Id. at 14-15, 20.\nC. Analysis\n      Section 5782(c) of the Law applies to \u201cany action or proceeding instituted or\nmaintained by less than the smaller of 50 members of any class or 5% of the\nmembers of any class of the corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(c) (emphasis added).\nThe orphans\u2019 court and the parties agree the Rubinoffs are not members, and, in fact,\nthe Foundation has no members. Accordingly, Section 5782(c) does not permit an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against them.\n      Although the Directors contend Section 5782(c) sets a minimum threshold of\nmembers that plaintiffs must have to avoid paying attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, their\nargument is contrary to the remainder of the section. Section 5782(a) applies to \u201cany\naction or proceeding brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more\nmembers of a nonprofit corporation.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(a) (emphasis added). It\nexpressly requires that \u201ceach plaintiff must aver and it must be made to appear that\neach plaintiff was a member of the corporation at the time of the transaction of\nwhich he complains.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Section 5782(b) supplies an exception\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fto this rule, but it applies only to \u201c[a]ny member\u201d who fails to meet the requirements\nof Section 5782(a). 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5782(b) (emphasis added).\n      Moreover, our review of the record does not indicate the Rubinoffs \u201cagreed\u201d\nto pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Rubinoffs cited Section 5782 in Count III of\ntheir petition for rule to show cause. The Directors filed an answer and new matter,\ncontending the Rubinoffs lacked standing under Section 5782 because they were not\nmembers of the Foundation. Nonetheless, the Directors maintained the Rubinoffs\nfailed to post security as required under Section 5782(c). The Rubinoffs filed a reply\nand answer to new matter arguing they had standing under Section 5782 but denying\nit was necessary to post security \u201cunder the facts and law applicable to this matter.\u201d\nReply to Answer and New Matter, 5/19/17, \u00b6 3.\n      The parties reached a compromise, which they memorialized with a letter and\nstipulated case management order. R.R. at 23a-26a. Neither the letter nor the order,\nhowever, guaranteed the Rubinoffs would pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if they were\nunsuccessful in the underlying litigation. The letter stated the Directors \u201cmay have\u201d\na claim for fees and costs, while the order applied \u201cshould the [orphans\u2019 c]ourt enter\na final [o]rder (after any appeals) awarding counsel fees under [Section] 5782(c) or\notherwise[.]\u201d Id.\n      When the Directors filed their petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, they based\ntheir request on the letter and stipulated case management order. The Directors also\nattached a copy of McDonough\u2019s e-mail to Pietragallo, recognizing the Rubinoffs\nwould make a deposit \u201cwithout prejudice to [their] position that no fees/expenses\nare recoverable.\u201d R.R. at 21a (emphasis added). The relevant testimony during the\nhearing on November 9, 2021, focused on the circumstances surrounding the letter,\nthe order, and counsels\u2019 e-mails.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      We recognize the inconsistency of the Rubinoffs\u2019 litigation positions in this\nmatter, which included citing Section 5782 of the Law when it suited them and then\ncontending Section 5782(c) did not apply. Section 5782(a) should have prevented\nthis problem by prohibiting the Rubinoffs from bringing a derivative action if they\nwere not members of the Foundation. Neither the plain language of Section 5782(c),\nnor the parties\u2019 compromise, permitted the orphans\u2019 court to award attorneys\u2019 fees\nand costs against individuals who were never members and who could not bring a\nderivative action in the first place. Therefore, we reverse the January 28, 2022 order\nand $500,000 award of fees and costs.\n                         III. Alleged Orphans\u2019 Court Bias\n      Issues not raised in the orphans\u2019 court are waived and cannot be raised for the\nfirst time on appeal.

Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">489 A.2d 1291</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301\n(Pa. 1985).\n      Here, the Rubinoffs concede they did not request the orphans\u2019 court judge\u2019s\nrecusal before he ruled on the merits of the underlying litigation and issued the order\nawarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Rubinoffs\u2019 Reply Br. at 8-9. They instead argue\nthey raised the issue \u201cat the first opportunity to do so following the final [o]rder\u201d by\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fincluding it in their concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. Rubinoffs\u2019\nReply Br. at 8-9. We cannot accept the Rubinoffs\u2019 explanation. In their brief, the\nRubinoffs allege 12 \u201cegregious examples\u201d of bias, but 8 of those examples involve\ndecisions and statements the judge made in the underlying litigation. See Rubinoffs\u2019\nBr. at 35, 60-67. If the judge\u2019s decisions and statements were as \u201cegregious\u201d as the\nRubinoffs suggest, they had every opportunity to seek recusal earlier. Accordingly,\nthe Rubinoffs failed to preserve their claim of bias for our review.\n      Even reaching the merits of the Rubinoffs\u2019 argument, our review of the record\ndoes not show the orphans\u2019 court judge was biased against them. Recusal decisions\nare within the sound discretion of the judge whose recusal is sought. Dunn v. Bd. of\nProp.

Rubinoffs\u2019 Br. at 60-62. We agree the orphans\u2019 court misinterpreted\nSection 5782(c) of the Law and erred by awarding fees and costs. At the same time,\nthe orphans\u2019 court reduced the amount of fees and costs that the Rubinoffs would be\nrequired to pay, demonstrating an effort to treat both sets of parties fairly.\n                                   IV.

The Trust argues that the\ntrial court erred in disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the\nsale conducted by the Schuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau (Bureau) complied with\nthe requirements set forth in the Real Estate Tax Sale Law (RETSL),1 including\nnotice of the pending upset tax sale to Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes\nprior to the sale date, and that the Bureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s\n\n      1\n          Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-5860.803.\n\fevidence that the Pennsylvania Homeowner Assistance Fund (PAHAF)2 would\nprovide the funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.3 After careful review, we\naffirm the trial court.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       The facts in this matter are undisputed. Due to $6,946.58 in delinquent real\nestate taxes, the Property was exposed to an upset tax sale on September 26, 2022,\nand sold to the Trust. Owner filed objections to the upset tax sale on November 23,\n2022, arguing that she notified the Bureau on September 22, 2022, that she received\nfunding to pay the outstanding taxes from PAHAF and that PAHAF had mailed a\ncheck in that amount to the Bureau. The Bureau refused to review the letter Owner\nprovided from PAHAF to substantiate the payment, which the Bureau received on\nthe date of the upset tax sale. Owner contended that the Bureau erred in refusing to\naccept the letter from PAHAF as evidence that the taxes would be paid, and she\nrequested that the trial court set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on Owner\u2019s objections on February 2, 2023.\nOwner testified on her own behalf and presented documentation from PAHAF\ndemonstrating that Owner had funding available to pay the delinquent taxes. The\nBureau presented the testimony of its interim Assistant Director, Deborah Dasch.\n\n\n       2\n          PAHAF is a program funded by the United States Department of the Treasury and\nadministered by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency that assists homeowners facing\nfinancial hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic. https://pahaf.org/faqs/ (last visited Jan.\n18, 2024). PAHAF\u2019s website indicates that it has paused new applications, effective February 1,\n2023.\n\n       3\n           We have reordered the Trust\u2019s arguments and consolidated issues to the extent they\noverlap. The Bureau filed a separate brief in which it adopted the Trust\u2019s arguments and also\nargued that, once Owner had notice of the upset tax sale and failed to pay the outstanding taxes\nprior to the date of sale, the trial court had no authority to set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        Owner acknowledged that she was delinquent in paying the 2020 real estate\ntaxes on the Property and that she received notice of the pending upset tax sale at the\nbeginning of September 2022. After receiving notice of the upset tax sale, Owner\ncontacted the Bureau to find out the total amount of delinquent taxes owed.\nThereafter, Owner filed an application with PAHAF for assistance with paying the\ndelinquent taxes, which PAHAF approved. On September 22, 2022, Owner received\nan email from PAHAF with an attached letter indicating that a check for $6,946.58\nwas mailed to the Bureau in satisfaction of the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes. The\nletter from PAHAF provided the pertinent tax account information, along with\nOwner\u2019s name and the Property\u2019s address. PAHAF\u2019s letter provided an email\naddress and telephone number should the Bureau have any questions.\n\n        Owner contacted the Bureau to confirm it received the payment from PAHAF.\nBased on a conversation Owner had with the Bureau\u2019s staff, Owner understood that\nPAHAF\u2019s check had not yet arrived, and that the Bureau would not accept the letter\nPAHAF emailed to Owner as proof of payment. Instead, PAHAF had to contact the\nBureau directly. After speaking with someone from PAHAF, Owner believed that\nPAHAF forwarded the September 22, 2022 letter to the Bureau. Approximately two\nweeks later, Owner was notified by \u201c[s]omebody\u201d that the Property had been sold at\nthe September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 89.4\n\n        Ms. Dasch testified that the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes had to be paid by 4:30\np.m. on September 23, 2022, before the Property would be removed from the upset\ntax sale. Regarding the assistance available through PAHAF, Ms. Dasch advised\n\n        4\n          The Trust\u2019s reproduced record does not comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2173, which requires that\n\u201cthe pages of . . . reproduced record . . . shall be numbered separately in Arabic figures . . . followed\nby a small a[.]\u201d The Trust failed to include the small \u201ca\u201d in its page numbers. Therefore, the\ncitations herein reflect those in the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fher contacts with PAHAF of the September 23, 2022 payment deadline. If payment\nwas not received by September 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m., the Bureau required that\nsomeone affiliated with PAHAF send the Bureau an email confirming that PAHAF\nwas \u201cin the process of cutting a check\u201d and that the delinquent taxes were\n\u201cguaranteed to be paid.\u201d Id. at 105. If PAHAF could provide proof that a taxpayer\nqualified for assistance, the Bureau would \u201cpause\u201d the upset tax sale of the\nassociated property. Id. at 108. Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she received an email\nfrom Karmesha Pitt, a servicing specialist with PAHAF, on September 21, 2022, in\nwhich Ms. Pitt requested the total amount of taxes owed for the Property; however,\nMs. Dasch did not receive any confirmation from PAHAF that Owner\u2019s application\nwas approved or that PAHAF had issued a check to cover the Property\u2019s delinquent\ntaxes. Ultimately, the Bureau received PAHAF\u2019s check for $6,946.58, along with\nPAHAF\u2019s September 22, 2022 letter, on September 26, 2023, after the Property had\nbeen sold. Ms. Dasch testified that, had she received an email from PAHAF before\n4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, the Bureau would have paused the upset tax sale\nof the Property.\n\n      During cross-examination, Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she \u201cmay have\u201d\nspoken with Owner in the week prior to the upset tax sale and that nothing would\nhave prevented her from reviewing the letter Owner received from PAHAF. Id. at\n111. Ms. Dasch stated that the Bureau does not accept such letters from taxpayers,\nhowever, because they could modify an email to \u201cmake it say whatever they want it\nto say.\u201d Id. at 112. Ms. Dasch conceded that, if she \u201chad the time[,]\u201d she could have\nreached out to PAHAF to confirm that the letter Owner would have provided was\nlegitimate; however, Ms. Dasch advised that her office is \u201cswamped with work and\ncustomers and phone calls\u201d prior to an upset tax sale. Id. at 118.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      The Bureau submitted into evidence two email exchanges between Ms. Dasch\nand PAHAF staff. In an August 31, 2022 email, Sharon Gagel, a servicing specialist\nwith PAHAF, inquired of Ms. Dasch as to the last date upon which upset tax sales\ncould be stayed, and whether Ms. Dasch would \u201caccept an email that a grant ha[d]\nbeen drafted . . . .\u201d Id. at 140. Ms. Dasch replied that she had been given the\nauthority to \u201c\u2018pause\u2019 any property for which [PAHAF] can provide proof that the\nowner is qualified for the program and a check will be sent to us.\u201d Id. If Ms. Gagel\nprovided the information prior to 4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, Ms. Dasch\nwould \u201cpause the parcel in question to get it off the sale.\u201d Id. The September 21,\n2022, email Ms. Dasch received from Ms. Pitt requested tax information specific to\nOwner and the Property. Ms. Pitt advised that Owner was seeking financial\nassistance from PAHAF and that time was \u201cof the essence[.]\u201d Id. at 140. In her\nresponse, Ms. Dasch attached several documents detailing the taxes owed on the\nProperty, and she advised Ms. Pitt to \u201clet [her] know if [she] had any questions.\u201d Id.\nat 130.\n\n      The trial court issued an order and opinion on February 10, 2023, sustaining\nOwner\u2019s objections and disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. The trial\ncourt noted that Ms. Dasch could have confirmed Owner\u2019s receipt of funding from\nPAHAF, as Ms. Dasch had previously corresponded with PAHAF staff by email.\nMs. Dasch did not dispute the legitimacy of the September 22, 2022 letter Owner\nwished to forward or refute that PAHAF sent funds prior to the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.   The trial court rejected Ms. Dasch\u2019s explanation that her office is\nunderstaffed and busy in the week prior to an upset tax sale. Although Owner\nindisputably failed to pay the real estate taxes on the Property, the trial court found\nthat Owner took appropriate steps to apply for emergency funding from PAHAF.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fAfter PAHAF approved her application, Owner contacted the Bureau to provide\ndocumentation that she had funding to cover the delinquent taxes on the Property,\nwhich the Bureau refused to review. The trial court recognized that PAHAF\n\u201cappear[ed] to have dropped the ball[,]\u201d as Owner advised PAHAF that it should\ncontact the Bureau directly. Id. at 32. Regardless, the trial court observed that the\nBureau \u201cworks for the people and not the other way around[,]\u201d suggesting that the\nBureau could hire more staff if it was overly busy, particularly given the Bureau\u2019s\nawareness of the emergency funding program administered by PAHAF. Id. The\ntrial court deemed the Bureau\u2019s staffing issues an insufficient reason to divest Owner\nof her property when confirmation of payment was available. Ultimately, the trial\ncourt concluded that allowing the upset tax sale of the Property to go forward would\npunish Owner, who did \u201ceverything within her power to pay the delinquent taxes on\nor before the deadline.\u201d Id. at 33.\n\n       This appeal followed.5\n\n                                              II. Issues\n\n       On appeal, the Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the\nSeptember 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with the\nrequirements set forth in the RETSL, including notice of the pending upset tax sale\nto Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes prior to the sale date, and that the\nBureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s evidence that PAHAF would provide\nthe funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.\n\n\n\n       5\n         This Court\u2019s scope of review in tax sale cases is limited to determining whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion, rendered a decision that lacks supporting evidence, or clearly erred as\na matter of law. Nguyen v. Del. Cnty. Tax Claim Bureau, 244 A.3d 96, 101 n.3 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2020).\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                   III.   Discussion\n\n      \u201c[I]t is a momentous event . . . when a government subjects a citizen\u2019s\nproperty to forfeiture for the non-payment of taxes.\u201d Tracy v. Chester Cnty. Tax\nClaim Bureau, 489 A.2d 1334, 1339 (Pa. 1985). The primary purpose of RETSL is\nnot to strip away a citizen\u2019s property rights but to ensure the collection of taxes. In\nre Consol. Reports and Return by Tax Claims Bureau of Northumberland Cty. of\nProp., 132 A.3d 637, 651 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (internal citations omitted). \u201cPrior to\nthe sale of real property for unpaid taxes, a tax claim bureau must give a taxpayer\nnotice and opportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Jenkins v. Fayette Cnty. Tax Claim\nBureau, 176 A.3d 1038, 1044 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018) (emphasis in original).\n\n      The Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the September 26,\n2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with all requirements in RETSL\nand Owner indisputably received notice of the upset tax sale. The Trust contends\nthat the trial court imposed burdens on the Bureau that do not appear in RETSL,\nsuch as accepting Owner\u2019s evidence that she received funding from PAHAF or\ncontacting PAHAF to confirm Owner\u2019s receipt of same. Additionally, the Trust\nargues that the trial court erred in finding that Owner provided the Bureau with\nadequate proof that the delinquent taxes would be paid and in disallowing the upset\ntax sale based on the Bureau\u2019s refusal to accept Owner\u2019s proof of payment by\nPAHAF. The Trust notes that the Bureau would not accept proof from Owner due\nto potential fraud and PAHAF did not provide the required communication by\nSeptember 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m. RETSL does not mandate that a tax claim bureau\naccept a property owner\u2019s \u201cpotentially fraudulent communication\u201d from PAHAF or\nrequire that a tax claim bureau take affirmative steps to confirm a property owner\u2019s\nacceptance into the PAHAF program. Trust\u2019s Br. at 19.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      In disallowing the upset tax sale, the trial court relied on Jenkins, in which this\nCourt upheld the setting aside of an upset tax sale where the taxpayer attempted to\npay her delinquent taxes three days before the sale and the county tax claim bureau\n\u201cimproperly refused\u201d her payment. Jenkins, 176 A.3d at 1043. We rejected the\nargument that the county tax bureau had fully complied with RETSL because,\n\u201c[p]rior to the sale of real property for unpaid taxes, a tax claim bureau must give a\ntaxpayer notice and opportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Id. at 1044 (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n      The facts in Jenkins differ somewhat from the instant appeal, as Owner\nindisputably did not pay the taxes prior to the upset tax sale. It is clear from Ms.\nDasch\u2019s testimony, however, that had PAHAF presented proof prior to the\nSeptember 23, 2022 deadline that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau would have\nremoved the Property from the upset tax sale. The Bureau would not consider the\nidentical proof offered by Owner well in advance of the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.\n\n      The Trust is correct that RETSL does not require a tax claim bureau to take\naffirmative steps to confirm that payment of delinquent taxes is forthcoming. This\nCourt has declined to find that an affirmative duty exists on the part of a tax claim\nbureau where a corresponding statutory right of the taxpayer does not also exist. For\nexample, in Matter of Tax Sale 2018-Upset, 227 A.3d 957 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020), this\nCourt held that a tax claim bureau did not have an affirmative duty to notify\ntaxpayers of the option to enter into an installment agreement for the payment of\ndelinquent taxes because Section 603 of RETSL, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.603, did not create\na statutory right for the payment of taxes in installments. Rather, installment\npayments were an option to be determined by the tax claim bureau.\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      This Court has held that an affirmative duty exists, however, where a statute\ngrants an individual \u201can actual entitlement\u201d or \u201can unqualified right to receive the\nbenefit[.]\u201d Miller v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Pavex, Inc.), 918 A.2d\n809, 812-13 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2007). In such a situation, the individual is entitled to\nprotection under the due process clause. Instantly, per Jenkins, Owner was entitled\nto have the \u201copportunity to cure the unpaid taxes.\u201d Jenkins, 176 A.3d at 1044\n(emphasis in original). To that end, Owner received funding from PAHAF to cover\nthe delinquent taxes, the proof of which she attempted to provide to the Bureau. The\nBureau refused to review the substantiating documentation Owner received directly\nfrom PAHAF, despite the Bureau\u2019s policy of pausing the sale of properties for which\nPAHAF could provide proof that an owner qualified for relief from PAHAF and\nprovide confirmation that payment would be sent. While Ms. Dasch testified that\nonly documentation sent directly by PAHAF was acceptable, her August 31, 2022\nemail to Ms. Gagel did not specify that a property owner could not forward\ninformation received from PAHAF, and there is no dispute that the letter Owner\nwished to present to the Bureau was a copy of the letter PAHAF mailed to the\nBureau.\n\n      Ultimately, the Bureau created a policy that offered Owner an additional\nopportunity to cure the delinquent taxes on the Property \u2013 a policy that the Bureau\nfailed to follow when it rejected the proof of payment Owner obtained from PAHAF.\nThus, Owner\u2019s opportunity to cure was essentially illusory, as Owner was forced to\nrely on the assurances of PAHAF that it sent the requisite proof. As noted above,\nthe purpose of RETSL is to ensure the collection of taxes, not to strip a taxpayer of\nher property. While Owner obtained funding to pay the delinquent taxes on the\nProperty, and obtained proof that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau elected to\n\n\n                                         9\n\fstrip Owner of her property instead. Under the specific facts of this case, the\nBureau\u2019s concerns that taxpayers would manipulate an email to \u201cmake it say\nwhatever they want it to say,\u201d are simply insufficient to justify disposing of the\nProperty at an upset tax sale. R.R. at 112.\n\n      The Trust argues that Owner is solely responsible for not paying the\ndelinquent taxes on the Property, resulting in its sale. It suggests that the trial court\u2019s\ndecision to grant Owner\u2019s exceptions creates a slippery slope that would permit\nobjections to a tax sale for reasons beyond a tax claim bureau\u2019s failure to comply\nwith RETSL. The Trust contends that, should this Court affirm the trial court, any\ntaxpayer could prevent an upset tax sale by submitting a fraudulent document\nindicating that a third party had committed to paying the taxes.\n\n      We are not convinced by the Trust\u2019s argument, as the instant appeal presents\nspecific and unique facts, and our holding herein is limited to those circumstances.\nMoreover, Ms. Dasch testified that an upset tax sale would only be paused based on\npayment by a government-funded program. The Bureau\u2019s policy would not apply\nwhere payment was guaranteed by a private individual.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\nsustaining Owner\u2019s objections to the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale.\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court.\n\n                                          __________________________________\n                                          ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\n\nKristen Moyer                       :\n                                    :\n      v.                            : No. 241 C.D. 2023\n                                    :\nSchuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau :\nand Commonwealth Commerce, LLC, :\nas Trustee for the 010722 Portfolio :\nTrust                               :\n                                    :\nAppeal of: Commonwealth             :\nCommerce, LLC, as Trustee for the :\n010722 Portfolio Trust              :\n\n\n                                ORDER\n\n\n     AND NOW, this 19th day of January, 2024, the February 10, 2023 order of\nthe Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n                                   __________________________________\n                                   ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">            IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\nKristen Moyer                       :\n                                    :\n      v.                            : No. 241 C.D. 2023\n                                    :\nSchuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau :\nand Commonwealth Commerce, LLC, :\nas Trustee for the 010722 Portfolio :\nTrust                               :\n                                    :\nAppeal of: Commonwealth             :\nCommerce, LLC, as Trustee for the :\n010722 Portfolio Trust              : Argued: December 4, 2023\n\nBEFORE:        HONORABLE REN\u00c9E COHN JUBELIRER, President Judge\n               HONORABLE CHRISTINE FIZZANO CANNON, Judge\n               HONORABLE ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBY JUDGE CEISLER                                                  FILED: January 19, 2024\n\n      Commonwealth Commerce, LLC, as Trustee for the 010722 Portfolio Trust\n(Trust), appeals from the February 10, 2023 order of the Court of Common Pleas of\nSchuylkill County (trial court) sustaining objections filed by Kristen Moyer (Owner)\nto a September 26, 2022 upset tax sale that disposed of Owner\u2019s real property located\nat 107 Vine Street, Ringtown, Pennsylvania (Property). The Trust argues that the\ntrial court erred in disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the\nsale conducted by the Schuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau (Bureau) complied with\nthe requirements set forth in the Real Estate Tax Sale Law (RETSL),1 including\nnotice of the pending upset tax sale to Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes\nprior to the sale date, and that the Bureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s\n\n      1\n          Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-5860.803.\n\fevidence that the Pennsylvania Homeowner Assistance Fund (PAHAF)2 would\nprovide the funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.3 After careful review, we\naffirm the trial court.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       The facts in this matter are undisputed. Due to $6,946.58 in delinquent real\nestate taxes, the Property was exposed to an upset tax sale on September 26, 2022,\nand sold to the Trust. Owner filed objections to the upset tax sale on November 23,\n2022, arguing that she notified the Bureau on September 22, 2022, that she received\nfunding to pay the outstanding taxes from PAHAF and that PAHAF had mailed a\ncheck in that amount to the Bureau. The Bureau refused to review the letter Owner\nprovided from PAHAF to substantiate the payment, which the Bureau received on\nthe date of the upset tax sale. Owner contended that the Bureau erred in refusing to\naccept the letter from PAHAF as evidence that the taxes would be paid, and she\nrequested that the trial court set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on Owner\u2019s objections on February 2, 2023.\nOwner testified on her own behalf and presented documentation from PAHAF\ndemonstrating that Owner had funding available to pay the delinquent taxes. The\nBureau presented the testimony of its interim Assistant Director, Deborah Dasch.\n\n\n       2\n          PAHAF is a program funded by the United States Department of the Treasury and\nadministered by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency that assists homeowners facing\nfinancial hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic. https://pahaf.org/faqs/ (last visited Jan.\n18, 2024). PAHAF\u2019s website indicates that it has paused new applications, effective February 1,\n2023.\n\n       3\n           We have reordered the Trust\u2019s arguments and consolidated issues to the extent they\noverlap. The Bureau filed a separate brief in which it adopted the Trust\u2019s arguments and also\nargued that, once Owner had notice of the upset tax sale and failed to pay the outstanding taxes\nprior to the date of sale, the trial court had no authority to set aside the upset tax sale.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        Owner acknowledged that she was delinquent in paying the 2020 real estate\ntaxes on the Property and that she received notice of the pending upset tax sale at the\nbeginning of September 2022. After receiving notice of the upset tax sale, Owner\ncontacted the Bureau to find out the total amount of delinquent taxes owed.\nThereafter, Owner filed an application with PAHAF for assistance with paying the\ndelinquent taxes, which PAHAF approved. On September 22, 2022, Owner received\nan email from PAHAF with an attached letter indicating that a check for $6,946.58\nwas mailed to the Bureau in satisfaction of the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes. The\nletter from PAHAF provided the pertinent tax account information, along with\nOwner\u2019s name and the Property\u2019s address. PAHAF\u2019s letter provided an email\naddress and telephone number should the Bureau have any questions.\n\n        Owner contacted the Bureau to confirm it received the payment from PAHAF.\nBased on a conversation Owner had with the Bureau\u2019s staff, Owner understood that\nPAHAF\u2019s check had not yet arrived, and that the Bureau would not accept the letter\nPAHAF emailed to Owner as proof of payment. Instead, PAHAF had to contact the\nBureau directly. After speaking with someone from PAHAF, Owner believed that\nPAHAF forwarded the September 22, 2022 letter to the Bureau. Approximately two\nweeks later, Owner was notified by \u201c[s]omebody\u201d that the Property had been sold at\nthe September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 89.4\n\n        Ms. Dasch testified that the Property\u2019s delinquent taxes had to be paid by 4:30\np.m. on September 23, 2022, before the Property would be removed from the upset\ntax sale. Regarding the assistance available through PAHAF, Ms. Dasch advised\n\n        4\n          The Trust\u2019s reproduced record does not comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2173, which requires that\n\u201cthe pages of . . . reproduced record . . . shall be numbered separately in Arabic figures . . . followed\nby a small a[.]\u201d The Trust failed to include the small \u201ca\u201d in its page numbers. Therefore, the\ncitations herein reflect those in the reproduced record.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fher contacts with PAHAF of the September 23, 2022 payment deadline. If payment\nwas not received by September 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m., the Bureau required that\nsomeone affiliated with PAHAF send the Bureau an email confirming that PAHAF\nwas \u201cin the process of cutting a check\u201d and that the delinquent taxes were\n\u201cguaranteed to be paid.\u201d Id. at 105. If PAHAF could provide proof that a taxpayer\nqualified for assistance, the Bureau would \u201cpause\u201d the upset tax sale of the\nassociated property. Id. at 108. Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she received an email\nfrom Karmesha Pitt, a servicing specialist with PAHAF, on September 21, 2022, in\nwhich Ms. Pitt requested the total amount of taxes owed for the Property; however,\nMs. Dasch did not receive any confirmation from PAHAF that Owner\u2019s application\nwas approved or that PAHAF had issued a check to cover the Property\u2019s delinquent\ntaxes. Ultimately, the Bureau received PAHAF\u2019s check for $6,946.58, along with\nPAHAF\u2019s September 22, 2022 letter, on September 26, 2023, after the Property had\nbeen sold. Ms. Dasch testified that, had she received an email from PAHAF before\n4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, the Bureau would have paused the upset tax sale\nof the Property.\n\n      During cross-examination, Ms. Dasch acknowledged that she \u201cmay have\u201d\nspoken with Owner in the week prior to the upset tax sale and that nothing would\nhave prevented her from reviewing the letter Owner received from PAHAF. Id. at\n111. Ms. Dasch stated that the Bureau does not accept such letters from taxpayers,\nhowever, because they could modify an email to \u201cmake it say whatever they want it\nto say.\u201d Id. at 112. Ms. Dasch conceded that, if she \u201chad the time[,]\u201d she could have\nreached out to PAHAF to confirm that the letter Owner would have provided was\nlegitimate; however, Ms. Dasch advised that her office is \u201cswamped with work and\ncustomers and phone calls\u201d prior to an upset tax sale. Id. at 118.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      The Bureau submitted into evidence two email exchanges between Ms. Dasch\nand PAHAF staff. In an August 31, 2022 email, Sharon Gagel, a servicing specialist\nwith PAHAF, inquired of Ms. Dasch as to the last date upon which upset tax sales\ncould be stayed, and whether Ms. Dasch would \u201caccept an email that a grant ha[d]\nbeen drafted . . . .\u201d Id. at 140. Ms. Dasch replied that she had been given the\nauthority to \u201c\u2018pause\u2019 any property for which [PAHAF] can provide proof that the\nowner is qualified for the program and a check will be sent to us.\u201d Id. If Ms. Gagel\nprovided the information prior to 4:30 p.m. on September 23, 2022, Ms. Dasch\nwould \u201cpause the parcel in question to get it off the sale.\u201d Id. The September 21,\n2022, email Ms. Dasch received from Ms. Pitt requested tax information specific to\nOwner and the Property. Ms. Pitt advised that Owner was seeking financial\nassistance from PAHAF and that time was \u201cof the essence[.]\u201d Id. at 140. In her\nresponse, Ms. Dasch attached several documents detailing the taxes owed on the\nProperty, and she advised Ms. Pitt to \u201clet [her] know if [she] had any questions.\u201d Id.\nat 130.\n\n      The trial court issued an order and opinion on February 10, 2023, sustaining\nOwner\u2019s objections and disallowing the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale. The trial\ncourt noted that Ms. Dasch could have confirmed Owner\u2019s receipt of funding from\nPAHAF, as Ms. Dasch had previously corresponded with PAHAF staff by email.\nMs. Dasch did not dispute the legitimacy of the September 22, 2022 letter Owner\nwished to forward or refute that PAHAF sent funds prior to the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.   The trial court rejected Ms. Dasch\u2019s explanation that her office is\nunderstaffed and busy in the week prior to an upset tax sale. Although Owner\nindisputably failed to pay the real estate taxes on the Property, the trial court found\nthat Owner took appropriate steps to apply for emergency funding from PAHAF.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fAfter PAHAF approved her application, Owner contacted the Bureau to provide\ndocumentation that she had funding to cover the delinquent taxes on the Property,\nwhich the Bureau refused to review. The trial court recognized that PAHAF\n\u201cappear[ed] to have dropped the ball[,]\u201d as Owner advised PAHAF that it should\ncontact the Bureau directly. Id. at 32. Regardless, the trial court observed that the\nBureau \u201cworks for the people and not the other way around[,]\u201d suggesting that the\nBureau could hire more staff if it was overly busy, particularly given the Bureau\u2019s\nawareness of the emergency funding program administered by PAHAF. Id. The\ntrial court deemed the Bureau\u2019s staffing issues an insufficient reason to divest Owner\nof her property when confirmation of payment was available. Ultimately, the trial\ncourt concluded that allowing the upset tax sale of the Property to go forward would\npunish Owner, who did \u201ceverything within her power to pay the delinquent taxes on\nor before the deadline.\u201d Id. at 33.\n\n       This appeal followed.5\n\n                                              II. Issues\n\n       On appeal, the Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the\nSeptember 26, 2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with the\nrequirements set forth in the RETSL, including notice of the pending upset tax sale\nto Owner, who failed to pay the delinquent taxes prior to the sale date, and that the\nBureau was not obligated to accept Owner\u2019s evidence that PAHAF would provide\nthe funds necessary to pay the delinquent taxes.\n\n\n\n       5\n         This Court\u2019s scope of review in tax sale cases is limited to determining whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion, rendered a decision that lacks supporting evidence, or clearly erred as\na matter of law.

Cmwlth. 2018) (emphasis in original).\n\n      The Trust argues that the trial court erred in disallowing the September 26,\n2022 upset tax sale because the Bureau complied with all requirements in RETSL\nand Owner indisputably received notice of the upset tax sale. The Trust contends\nthat the trial court imposed burdens on the Bureau that do not appear in RETSL,\nsuch as accepting Owner\u2019s evidence that she received funding from PAHAF or\ncontacting PAHAF to confirm Owner\u2019s receipt of same. Additionally, the Trust\nargues that the trial court erred in finding that Owner provided the Bureau with\nadequate proof that the delinquent taxes would be paid and in disallowing the upset\ntax sale based on the Bureau\u2019s refusal to accept Owner\u2019s proof of payment by\nPAHAF. The Trust notes that the Bureau would not accept proof from Owner due\nto potential fraud and PAHAF did not provide the required communication by\nSeptember 23, 2022 at 4:30 p.m. RETSL does not mandate that a tax claim bureau\naccept a property owner\u2019s \u201cpotentially fraudulent communication\u201d from PAHAF or\nrequire that a tax claim bureau take affirmative steps to confirm a property owner\u2019s\nacceptance into the PAHAF program.

It is clear from Ms.\nDasch\u2019s testimony, however, that had PAHAF presented proof prior to the\nSeptember 23, 2022 deadline that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau would have\nremoved the Property from the upset tax sale. The Bureau would not consider the\nidentical proof offered by Owner well in advance of the September 23, 2022\ndeadline.\n\n      The Trust is correct that RETSL does not require a tax claim bureau to take\naffirmative steps to confirm that payment of delinquent taxes is forthcoming. This\nCourt has declined to find that an affirmative duty exists on the part of a tax claim\nbureau where a corresponding statutory right of the taxpayer does not also exist. For\nexample, in Matter of Tax Sale 2018-Upset, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">227 A.3d 957</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020), this\nCourt held that a tax claim bureau did not have an affirmative duty to notify\ntaxpayers of the option to enter into an installment agreement for the payment of\ndelinquent taxes because Section 603 of RETSL, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.603, did not create\na statutory right for the payment of taxes in installments. Rather, installment\npayments were an option to be determined by the tax claim bureau.\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      This Court has held that an affirmative duty exists, however, where a statute\ngrants an individual \u201can actual entitlement\u201d or \u201can unqualified right to receive the\nbenefit[.]\u201d Miller v.

To that end, Owner received funding from PAHAF to cover\nthe delinquent taxes, the proof of which she attempted to provide to the Bureau. The\nBureau refused to review the substantiating documentation Owner received directly\nfrom PAHAF, despite the Bureau\u2019s policy of pausing the sale of properties for which\nPAHAF could provide proof that an owner qualified for relief from PAHAF and\nprovide confirmation that payment would be sent. While Ms. Dasch testified that\nonly documentation sent directly by PAHAF was acceptable, her August 31, 2022\nemail to Ms. Gagel did not specify that a property owner could not forward\ninformation received from PAHAF, and there is no dispute that the letter Owner\nwished to present to the Bureau was a copy of the letter PAHAF mailed to the\nBureau.\n\n      Ultimately, the Bureau created a policy that offered Owner an additional\nopportunity to cure the delinquent taxes on the Property \u2013 a policy that the Bureau\nfailed to follow when it rejected the proof of payment Owner obtained from PAHAF.\nThus, Owner\u2019s opportunity to cure was essentially illusory, as Owner was forced to\nrely on the assurances of PAHAF that it sent the requisite proof. As noted above,\nthe purpose of RETSL is to ensure the collection of taxes, not to strip a taxpayer of\nher property. While Owner obtained funding to pay the delinquent taxes on the\nProperty, and obtained proof that payment was forthcoming, the Bureau elected to\n\n\n                                         9\n\fstrip Owner of her property instead. Under the specific facts of this case, the\nBureau\u2019s concerns that taxpayers would manipulate an email to \u201cmake it say\nwhatever they want it to say,\u201d are simply insufficient to justify disposing of the\nProperty at an upset tax sale. R.R. at 112.\n\n      The Trust argues that Owner is solely responsible for not paying the\ndelinquent taxes on the Property, resulting in its sale. It suggests that the trial court\u2019s\ndecision to grant Owner\u2019s exceptions creates a slippery slope that would permit\nobjections to a tax sale for reasons beyond a tax claim bureau\u2019s failure to comply\nwith RETSL. The Trust contends that, should this Court affirm the trial court, any\ntaxpayer could prevent an upset tax sale by submitting a fraudulent document\nindicating that a third party had committed to paying the taxes.\n\n      We are not convinced by the Trust\u2019s argument, as the instant appeal presents\nspecific and unique facts, and our holding herein is limited to those circumstances.\nMoreover, Ms. Dasch testified that an upset tax sale would only be paused based on\npayment by a government-funded program. The Bureau\u2019s policy would not apply\nwhere payment was guaranteed by a private individual.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\nsustaining Owner\u2019s objections to the September 26, 2022 upset tax sale.\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court.\n\n                                          __________________________________\n                                          ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\n\nKristen Moyer                       :\n                                    :\n      v.                            : No. 241 C.D. 2023\n                                    :\nSchuylkill County Tax Claim Bureau :\nand Commonwealth Commerce, LLC, :\nas Trustee for the 010722 Portfolio :\nTrust                               :\n                                    :\nAppeal of: Commonwealth             :\nCommerce, LLC, as Trustee for the :\n010722 Portfolio Trust              :\n\n\n                                ORDER\n\n\n     AND NOW, this 19th day of January, 2024, the February 10, 2023 order of\nthe Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n                                   __________________________________\n                                   ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1537711/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4233982/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925393/", "id": 9925393, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467555/kd-morgan-v-the-stotesbury-community-assoc-inc/", "cluster_id": 9467555, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467555/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T09:09:08.206706-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T09:50:04.131908-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "5b0a65f611f6b60449b6ae7eaa57beb734c7e593", "page_count": 15, "download_url": "https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Commonwealth/out/1093CD22_1-19-24.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/k.d._morgan_v._the_stotesbury_community_assoc._inc..pdf", "plain_text": "         IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nKimberly D.

Morgan (Morgan) and the\nStotesbury Community Association, Inc. (Association) appeal the Court of Common\nPleas of Montgomery County\u2019s (trial court) order dated August 31, 2022 (Order),\nwhich granted in part and denied in part Morgan\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\n\ffees and costs and denied the Association\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees and\ncosts. After review, we affirm.\n         The trial court aptly set forth the factual background underlying this dispute\nin its Rule 1925(a) Opinion,1 dated Dec. 6, 2022 (Trial Court Opinion), as follows:\n\n         The planned community, known as Stotesbury, is located in Springfield\n         Township. Stotesbury was created pursuant to a Declaration of\n         Community Covenants, Restrictions and Easements dated September\n         26, 1979, and recorded with the Recorder of Deeds (\u201cthe Declaration\u201d).\n         [The Association] is the unit owners\u2019 association for Stotesbury. It is\n         governed by a Board of Directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d), subject to the\n         Declaration and the Bylaws of the Association. [Morgan] is the owner\n         of a residential townhouse unit in Stotesbury.\n\n         At the time that [Morgan] purchased her unit in November 1990, a\n         retaining wall (\u201cthe Old Wall\u201d) had been installed. The length of the\n         Old Wall was located approximately 50% in [Morgan\u2019s] backyard,\n         within the boundaries and near the rear border of her unit, and\n         approximately 50% on adjacent property that was common area owned\n         by the Association. Beginning in 2004 and continuing thereafter,\n         [Morgan] notified the Association, through its property management\n         company and the Board, that the Old Wall was deteriorating and falling\n         apart. The Association was not responsive.\n\n         In 2014, [Morgan] engaged Max L. Lieberman, Esquire, [(Morgan\u2019s\n         Counsel)] to press her concerns to the Association. By letter to the\n         property manager dated December 14, 2015, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel]\n         reiterated [Morgan\u2019s] concerns about the Old Wall and the need to\n         replace it. Enclosed with the letter was the report of an engineering\n         firm engaged by [Morgan], recommending replacement of the Old\n         Wall. At a meeting of the Board on March 24, 2016, the Board\n         discussed that the Old Wall needed to be replaced.\n\n         The Old Wall functioned as a single structure and could only be\n         replaced in toto. The Board engaged a contractor for removal and\n         replacement of the Old Wall for the sum of $7,685. The Board did not\n         consult with or collaborate with [Morgan] in the selection of the\n         contractor or of the design for the replacement wall.\n\n1\n    See Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fBy letter dated September 29, 2016, Stefan Richter, Esquire, [(the\nAssociation\u2019s Counsel)] . . . notified [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] that [Morgan]\nwould be responsible for one-half of the cost of the work and that if she\nrefused to pay, the Association would sue her to recover this amount\ntogether with costs and attorney fees. By a responsive letter dated\nOctober 6, 2016, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] informed [the Association\u2019s\nCounsel] that [Morgan] objected to paying half the cost and also that\nshe considered the proposed design of the replacement wall to be\ninadequate. Enclosed with the letter were a report from another\nengineering firm engaged by [Morgan] and estimates from two\ncontractors for the more extensive work that [Morgan] was demanding.\n\nOn or about October 24, 2016, the Association\u2019s contractor removed\nthe Old Wall and installed a replacement wall (\u201cthe New Wall\u201d). The\nNew Wall was erected in substantially the same location as the Old\nWall, with the design to which [Morgan] had objected. Like the Old\nWall, the New Wall functions as a single structure and can only be\nreplaced in toto.\n\nBy letter to [the Association\u2019s Counsel] dated November 28, 2016,\n[Morgan\u2019s Counsel] stated that the New Wall was inadequate and\nneeded to be replaced. Enclosed with the letter was a supplemental\nengineering report regarding the New Wall. Also enclosed was an\n\u201cinvoice\u201d rendered by [Morgan] to the Association for fees from the\ntwo engineering firms she had engaged and for [Morgan\u2019s Counsel\u2019s]\nfees. By letters to [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] dated January 5, 2017, and\nMarch 24, 2017, respectively, [the Association\u2019s Counsel] reiterated\nthe Association\u2019s demand for payment by [Morgan] of one-half of the\n$7,685 cost of the New Wall \u2013 i.e., $3,842.50. The March 24 letter\nagain threatened suit if payment was not made.\n\n[Morgan] commenced this action against the Association by Writ of\nSummons on October 2, 2018. Her Complaint, filed January 22, 2019,\nasserted five counts. Count I sought a declaratory judgment that, inter\nalia, [Morgan] is not responsible for one-half of the cost of replacing\nthe Old Wall and that the Association bears sole responsibility for the\nmaintenance, repair, and replacement of the New Wall as necessary.\nCount I also sought unspecified damages, punitive damages, and\nattorney fees. Counts II (injunctive relief), III (nuisance) and IV\n(breach of contract) sought injunctive relief and monetary damages,\nincluding attorney fees, on the ground that the New Wall was\ninadequate and needed to be replaced. Count V, for implied contract,\n\n\n                                   3\n\f         quasi-contract, and unjust enrichment, sought recovery of the\n         engineering fees that [Morgan] had incurred.\n\n         [A n]onjury trial was held on June 15 and 16, 2022. At the outset of\n         trial, it was agreed that any award of attorney fees incurred in\n         connection with the litigation would be reserved and would be raised\n         by motion after issuance of the Court\u2019s decision. That procedure was\n         reconfirmed at the close of the trial.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12/6/22, at 1-4 (footnotes, headnotes and internal citations\nomitted).\n         On June 23, 2022, the trial court issued its decision on the underlying dispute.\nThe trial court determined under the Uniform Planned Community Act (Act),2 the\nAssociation bore the sole responsibility for replacing the Old Wall and maintaining\nthe New Wall. Id. at 4. Therefore, it found in favor of Morgan on Count I, but did\nnot award compensatory damages because the Association had paid its contractor in\nfull for the replacement of the Old Wall, and it did not award punitive damages\nbecause it found the Association had not acted willfully. Id. at 6. On Counts II\nthrough IV, the trial court found the New Wall was structurally sound and in good\ncondition and did not need to be replaced. Id. Therefore, the trial court found in\nfavor of the Association. Id. Similarly, as to Count V, for unjust enrichment, the\ntrial court found in favor of the Association. Id. Neither party challenged the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision.\n         On July 5, 2022, both Morgan and the Association filed motions seeking an\naward of attorney fees and costs. Morgan sought an award of $280,066.13. The\nAssociation sought an award of approximately $81,860.80.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5414.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      In its Order, the trial court granted Morgan\u2019s request, in part, by awarding her\nattorney fees in the amount of $50,000. The trial court denied the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees entirely. The trial court explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n      In determining the parties\u2019 respective requests for fees and costs under\n      [S]ection 5412 of the [Act], the [trial court] has considered primarily\n      the following factors . . . .\n\n   \u2022 This dispute arose from the Association\u2019s repeated insistence that\n     [Morgan] bear one-half the expense of replacing the Old Wall and its\n     threats to sue her to recover that amount. As the [trial court\u2019s d]ecision\n     explains, while this position was apparently asserted by the Association\n     in good faith, it did not represent a reasonable interpretation of the Act.\n     But for the Association\u2019s position, it is possible that litigation would\n     have been avoided.\n\n   \u2022 At the same time, the [trial court] found [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall to be without sufficient supporting evidence.\n     These issues accounted for the great majority of time spent on discovery\n     and trial. [Morgan\u2019s] persistence in seeking to require the Association\n     to remove and rebuild the New Wall made settlement of this matter\n     especially difficult. Unlike the Association\u2019s position on the cost of\n     replacing the Old Wall, however, [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall were not unreasonable.\n\n   \u2022 In the attorney invoices submitted by [Morgan], the descriptions of the\n     subject matter of work performed are heavily redacted. As a result, the\n     allocation of time spent between the issues on which [Morgan]\n     prevailed and those on which she did not prevail is problematic.\n\n   \u2022 Section 5412 [of the Act] authorizes the [trial court], in a suit for\n     violation of the Act or the declaration or bylaws, to award costs and\n     reasonable attorney[] fees to the prevailing party \u201cif appropriate\u201d \u2013\n     language that vests the [trial court] with broad discretion. The\n     Association\u2019s reading of this provision \u2013 that it applies only when\n     punitive damages are awarded \u2013 is inconsistent with its language and\n     legislative history.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12/6/22, at 8.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f       On September 9, 2022, Morgan filed a motion for partial reconsideration of\nthe trial court\u2019s Order and on September 12, 2022, the Association responded with\na cross-motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order. On September 19,\n2022, the trial court denied both motions for reconsideration.\n       Both Morgan and the Association now appeal to this Court. On appeal,\nMorgan argues the trial court committed an error of law and abused its discretion by\nawarding her only $50,000 in costs and attorney fees when the statute authorizing\nthe award of attorney fees compelled an award of $280,066.13. Morgan\u2019s Br. at 4.\nRegarding the Association\u2019s request for attorney fees, Morgan contends the trial\ncourt properly exercised its discretion in denying the Association\u2019s request because\nthe trial court determined the Association\u2019s conduct to be unreasonable and an award\nof attorney fees and costs would not be appropriate. Id. Meanwhile, the Association\nasserts the trial court erred and abused its discretion by denying the Association\u2019s\nmotion for attorney fees and expenses in its entirety when the Association acted in\ngood faith and prevailed on the majority of the initial claims. Association\u2019s Br. at 5.\nRegarding the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Morgan, the Association\ncontends the applicable statutory scheme did not compel the trial court to award the\nfull amount of requested attorney fees to Morgan and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in awarding $50,000 in attorney fees and costs. Association\u2019s Third-Step\nBr. at 2, 5, 13.\n                                   DISCUSSION\n       Where an award of attorney fees is authorized by statute, we review the trial\ncourt\u2019s fee award under an abuse of discretion standard. Samuel-Bassett v. Kia\nMotors Am., Inc., 34 A.3d 1, 51 (Pa. 2011). An abuse of discretion requires a\n\u201cshowing of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fsuch lack of support as to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Wagner v. Pa. Capitol Police Dep\u2019t,\n132 A.3d 1051, 1057-59 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (quoting Paden v. Baker Concrete\nConstr., Inc., 658 A.2d 341, 343 (Pa. 1995)). We will not find \u201can abuse of\ndiscretion . . . merely because [we] might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d Id.\nSo \u201clong as the trial court reviews the record . . . it is difficult for an appellate court\nto hold a trial court abused its discretion in issuing a particular award of attorney\nfees.\u201d Arches Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Robinson, 131 A.3d 122, 132-33 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015).\nCredibility and conflicts in the evidence are for the trial court to resolve. Beaver\nFalls Mun. Auth. ex rel. Penndale Water Line Extension v. Beaver Falls Mun. Auth.,\n960 A.2d 933, 940 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008). This Court will \u201cnot disturb a trial court\u2019s\ncredibility determinations where explained\u201d or obvious from the record. Id. Where\nthe trial court\u2019s discretion is challenged on appeal, the challenging party bears a\nheavy burden. Paden, 658 A.2d at 343. To the extent we address issues of statutory\ninterpretation, our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is de novo.\nSamuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 51. This means that as to these issues, we do not defer to\nthe trial court when reaching a decision and we review the entire record on appeal.\nMercury Trucking, Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 55 A.3d 1056, 1082 (Pa.\n2012) (citing Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole), 860\nA.2d 25, 29 n.2 (Pa. 2004)).\n       First, we address Morgan\u2019s argument that the trial court erred at law and\nabused its discretion when it awarded her $50,000 in attorney fees rather than the\n$280,066.13 she requested. Morgan asserts the \u201cstatutory scheme under the plain\nlanguage of the [Act] . . . compel[ ] that she be made whole and awarded\u201d her entire\nrequested amount. Morgan\u2019s Br. at 16. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f      It is the general rule that absent express statutory authority, each party pays\nits own attorney fees. Fitzgerald v. City of Phila., 487 A.2d 485 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1985);\nsee also Section 1726(a)(1) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1726(a)(1) (providing\nattorney fees are not an item of taxable costs except as permitted by Section 2503 of\nthe Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503, relating to the right of participants to receive\ncounsel fees, which is not at issue here). Here, the parties\u2019 underlying dispute arose\nunder the Act and Section 5412 of the Act, which provides:\n\n      If a declarant or any other person subject to this subpart violates any\n      provision of this subpart or any provisions of the declaration or bylaws,\n      any person or class of persons adversely affected by the violation has a\n      claim for appropriate relief. Punitive damages may be awarded in the\n      case of a willful violation of the subpart and, if appropriate, the\n      prevailing party may be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable\n      attorney fees.\n\n68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5412.\n      The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act), 1\nPa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1991, provides \u201c[t]he object of all interpretation and construction\nof statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Generally, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain\nlanguage of a statute. Commonwealth v. Shiffler, 879 A.2d 185, 189 (Pa. 2005). It\nis well settled that \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all\nambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its\nspirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a71921(b). Furthermore, we construe the words and phrases of a\nstatute \u201caccording to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved\nusage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\n      Section 5412 of the Act plainly provides \u201cif appropriate, the prevailing party\nmay be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n\n                                          8\n\f5412 (emphasis added). The use of the phrase \u201cif appropriate\u201d and the word \u201cmay\u201d\nare crucial in interpreting the meaning of the statute. \u201cAlthough \u2018may\u2019 can mean the\nsame as \u2018shall\u2019 where a statute directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice, it\nordinarily is employed in the permissive sense.\u201d Commonwealth v. Garland, 142\nA.2d 14, 17, n.5 (Pa. 1958) (internal citations omitted). Here, the word \u201cmay\u201d is\ncoupled with the phrase \u201cif appropriate.\u201d This plain permissive language leaves the\ndecision of whether to award attorney fees at all to the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt. Moreover, the statute is clear that any award of attorney fees must be\nreasonable.\n       Generally, the courts retain discretion to determine what is reasonable when\nawarding attorney fees. Oberneder v. Link Comput. Corp., 696 A.2d 148, 151 (Pa.\n1997). As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court outlined in In re Trust Estate of\nLaRocca,\n\n      the amount of fees to be allowed to counsel, always a subject of\n      delicacy if not difficulty, is one peculiarly within the discretion of the\n      court of first instance. Its opportunities of judging the exact amount of\n      labor, skill, and responsibility involved, as well as its knowledge of the\n      rate of professional compensation usual at the time and place, are\n      necessarily greater than ours[.]\n\n246 A.2d 337, 340 (Pa. 1968) (citation omitted). Thus, a trial court\u2019s award should\nbe based on \u201call the circumstances\u201d of a case and it is up to the court to determine\nwhether certain tasks constitute a reasonable legal response to an action or, instead,\nhave an attenuated relation to the action. Twp. of Millcreek v. Angela Cres Trust of\nJune 25, 1988, 222 A.3d 1199, 1208 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2019).\n      In LaRocca, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court outlined the specific factors to\nbe considered when determining reasonableness as follows:\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f         the amount of work performed; the character of the services rendered;\n         the difficulty of the problems involved; the importance of the litigation;\n         the amount of money or value of the property in question; the degree of\n         responsibility incurred; whether the fund involved was \u2018created\u2019 by the\n         attorney; the professional skill and standing of the attorney in his\n         profession; the results he was able to obtain; the ability of the client to\n         pay a reasonable fee for the services rendered; and, very importantly,\n         the amount of money or the value of the property in question.\n\nLaRocca, 246 A.2d at 339-40. Notably, the trial court need not address every\nLaRocca factor because any one or a combination of those factors may convince the\ntrial court a fee other than the requested fee is justified. Carmen Enters., Inc. v.\nMurpenter, LLC, 185 A.3d 380, 390 (Pa. Super. 2018) (citation omitted). Further,\nwhile the trial court must sufficiently explain its reasoning to enable meaningful\nappellate review, the trial court is not required to \u201cdelineate with specificity . . .\nevery reason for every disallowance of every aspect of the fee request.\u201d Twp. of\nMillcreek, 222 A.3d at 1206-07 (citing In re Appeal of Silverman, 90 A.3d 771, 786\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 2014)).\n         Initially, we reject Morgan\u2019s assertion that the plain language of the Act\nmandates she receive the full amount of her requested award. Morgan relies on\nSection 5114 of the Act,3 which provides the Act\u2019s provisions are to be \u201cliberally\nadministered to the end that the aggrieved party is put in as good a position as if the\nother party had fully performed.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114. Morgan contends this requires\nattorney fees authorized under Section 5412 of the Act \u201cmust be liberally awarded\nto make the aggrieved party whole.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 16. She interprets this to\nnecessitate an award equal to the full amount of her requested attorney fees.\nHowever, the plain language of the Act grants the trial court discretion whether to\naward attorney fees at all, and if it does, mandates the trial court to ensure awarded\n\n3\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fattorney fees are reasonable. To interpret the Act as Morgan suggests would\nobliviate the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining the reasonableness of attorney\nfees. Because the plain language of the statute requires the trial court ensure awarded\nattorney fees are reasonable, Morgan\u2019s interpretation of the Act would lead to an\nabsurd result whereby a court would be required to award attorney fees paid by the\nparty, even when those fees were unreasonable. A party is free to pursue all means\nand costs necessary in litigation, but it does not necessarily follow that the fees and\ncosts incurred are reasonable.         Therefore, we decline to adopt Morgan\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Act, which is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\n      Similarly, we reject Morgan\u2019s arguments that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by reducing her award of attorney fees. When determining its fee award,\nthe trial court considered the relative degrees of success of the parties in the\nunderlying litigation, the complexities of the legal issues involved, and the amount\nof work performed and required by the attorneys involved.               The trial court\ndetermined that because Morgan only \u201cprevailed\u201d on one of the issues before the\ntrial court, which was a less complex issue, a reduced award was warranted under\nthe circumstances. Morgan asserts the trial court improperly considered the redacted\nbilling statements as a basis to depart from the requested fee award and its award\nwas \u201carbitrarily selected.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 37. However, the redacted billing\nstatement was just one of the various factors considered by the trial court. Overall,\nthe trial court was familiar with the underlying dispute, the litigation, and the parties.\nThe trial court considered appropriate factors when fashioning a fair and reasonable\nattorney fee. The trial court\u2019s decision was not manifestly unreasonable, and the\ntrial court did not act with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will. Accordingly, we\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscern no legal error or abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award of $50,000 in\nattorney fees to Morgan.\n       Next, we turn to the Association\u2019s argument that the trial court erred or abused\nits discretion when it denied its request for attorney fees. The Association asserts\nbecause it prevailed on four out of five counts in the underlying dispute, the trial\ncourt erred by failing to award it attorney fees. The Association relies on this Court\u2019s\nholding in Serota v. London-Towne Homeowners\u2019 Association (Pa. Cmwlth., No.\n1451 C.D. 2017, filed Nov. 16, 2018).4 In Serota, an owner of numerous townhomes\nin a planned community filed suit against a homeowner\u2019s association challenging\nthe passage of an amendment that diluted the owner\u2019s voting power. Id., slip op. at\n1. After prevailing in the underlying dispute, the owner sought an award of attorney\nfees and costs under, inter alia, a previous version of Section 5412 of the Act, which\nnotably did not reference attorney fees. Id. The trial court rejected the owner\u2019s\nargument that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees and held the Act did not\nmandate an award of attorney fees. Id. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision. Id. In considering the language of the Act and the Uniform Law\nComment, we explained:\n\n       Contrary to [the owner\u2019s] contentions, however, neither the statutory\n       language of Section 5412 of the [Act] nor the Uniform Law Comment\n       mandate an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. As observed by [the trial court],\n       the statutory language at that time did not refer to attorneys\u2019 fees. And,\n       while the Uniform Law Comment does refer to attorneys\u2019 fees, such\n       reference is not binding on the court and, additionally, it considers the\n       award of such fees to be within the discretion of the court. Given the\n       parties\u2019 arguments before [the trial court], [the trial court] could have\n       exercised its discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees, but it was not\n       obligated to do so. We discern no abuse of discretion in [the trial\n\n4\n Under Section 414(a) of this Court\u2019s Internal Operating Procedures, 210 Pa. Code \u00a7 69.414(a),\nan unreported opinion of this Court may be cited as persuasive authority.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f      court\u2019s] decision not to award attorneys\u2019 fees, given the complexity of\n      the underlying litigation and [the trial court\u2019s] familiarity with the\n      litigation between these parties, including [the underlying lawsuit] and\n      a second lawsuit that was eventually settled.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n      Here, while the Association acknowledges the Serota holding in its brief, it\nasserts this decision supports its argument that the trial court erred or abused its\ndiscretion by failing to award it attorney fees. We disagree. Rather, our decision in\nSerota supports our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s determination. Here, just as in\nSerota, and as we explained above, the plain language of Section 5412 of the Act\ngrants the trial court discretion regarding whether to award attorney fees. We\nacknowledge the Association prevailed on numerous counts in the underlying\ndispute, but contrary to the Association\u2019s assertion, the Act does not mandate an\naward of attorney fees. The Association fails to point to any evidence in the record\nor any authority demonstrating the trial court\u2019s decision was manifestly\nunreasonable or the trial court acted with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will in\ndenying its request. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to award the Association attorney fees.\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      The trial court did not err or abuse its discretion when it issued its Order\ngranting, in part, Morgan\u2019s request for attorney fees and denying the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees. The plain language of Section 5412 of the Act grants the\ntrial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party. Moreover, the Act\nmandates the trial court ensure an award of attorney fees is reasonable. The trial\ncourt, familiar with the litigation and parties in the underlying dispute, properly\nconsidered various factors, including the complexity of the litigation, the degree of\nsuccess of the parties, and the amount of work necessary for the attorneys to properly\n\n                                         13\n\fconduct the litigation, in fashioning its fee award. Neither party demonstrated the\ntrial court\u2019s decision was manifestly unreasonable or the trial court acted with\npartiality, prejudice, or ill-will. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion\nunder the circumstances of this case. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                              STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f        IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nKimberly D.

Morgan (Morgan) and the\nStotesbury Community Association, Inc. (Association) appeal the Court of Common\nPleas of Montgomery County\u2019s (trial court) order dated August 31, 2022 (Order),\nwhich granted in part and denied in part Morgan\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\n\ffees and costs and denied the Association\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees and\ncosts. After review, we affirm.\n         The trial court aptly set forth the factual background underlying this dispute\nin its Rule 1925(a) Opinion,1 dated Dec. 6, 2022 (Trial Court Opinion), as follows:\n\n         The planned community, known as Stotesbury, is located in Springfield\n         Township. Stotesbury was created pursuant to a Declaration of\n         Community Covenants, Restrictions and Easements dated September\n         26, 1979, and recorded with the Recorder of Deeds (\u201cthe Declaration\u201d).\n         [The Association] is the unit owners\u2019 association for Stotesbury. It is\n         governed by a Board of Directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d), subject to the\n         Declaration and the Bylaws of the Association. [Morgan] is the owner\n         of a residential townhouse unit in Stotesbury.\n\n         At the time that [Morgan] purchased her unit in November 1990, a\n         retaining wall (\u201cthe Old Wall\u201d) had been installed. The length of the\n         Old Wall was located approximately 50% in [Morgan\u2019s] backyard,\n         within the boundaries and near the rear border of her unit, and\n         approximately 50% on adjacent property that was common area owned\n         by the Association. Beginning in 2004 and continuing thereafter,\n         [Morgan] notified the Association, through its property management\n         company and the Board, that the Old Wall was deteriorating and falling\n         apart. The Association was not responsive.\n\n         In 2014, [Morgan] engaged Max L. Lieberman, Esquire, [(Morgan\u2019s\n         Counsel)] to press her concerns to the Association. By letter to the\n         property manager dated December 14, 2015, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel]\n         reiterated [Morgan\u2019s] concerns about the Old Wall and the need to\n         replace it. Enclosed with the letter was the report of an engineering\n         firm engaged by [Morgan], recommending replacement of the Old\n         Wall. At a meeting of the Board on March 24, 2016, the Board\n         discussed that the Old Wall needed to be replaced.\n\n         The Old Wall functioned as a single structure and could only be\n         replaced in toto. The Board engaged a contractor for removal and\n         replacement of the Old Wall for the sum of $7,685. The Board did not\n         consult with or collaborate with [Morgan] in the selection of the\n         contractor or of the design for the replacement wall.\n\n1\n    See Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fBy letter dated September 29, 2016, Stefan Richter, Esquire, [(the\nAssociation\u2019s Counsel)] . . . notified [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] that [Morgan]\nwould be responsible for one-half of the cost of the work and that if she\nrefused to pay, the Association would sue her to recover this amount\ntogether with costs and attorney fees. By a responsive letter dated\nOctober 6, 2016, [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] informed [the Association\u2019s\nCounsel] that [Morgan] objected to paying half the cost and also that\nshe considered the proposed design of the replacement wall to be\ninadequate. Enclosed with the letter were a report from another\nengineering firm engaged by [Morgan] and estimates from two\ncontractors for the more extensive work that [Morgan] was demanding.\n\nOn or about October 24, 2016, the Association\u2019s contractor removed\nthe Old Wall and installed a replacement wall (\u201cthe New Wall\u201d). The\nNew Wall was erected in substantially the same location as the Old\nWall, with the design to which [Morgan] had objected. Like the Old\nWall, the New Wall functions as a single structure and can only be\nreplaced in toto.\n\nBy letter to [the Association\u2019s Counsel] dated November 28, 2016,\n[Morgan\u2019s Counsel] stated that the New Wall was inadequate and\nneeded to be replaced. Enclosed with the letter was a supplemental\nengineering report regarding the New Wall. Also enclosed was an\n\u201cinvoice\u201d rendered by [Morgan] to the Association for fees from the\ntwo engineering firms she had engaged and for [Morgan\u2019s Counsel\u2019s]\nfees. By letters to [Morgan\u2019s Counsel] dated January 5, 2017, and\nMarch 24, 2017, respectively, [the Association\u2019s Counsel] reiterated\nthe Association\u2019s demand for payment by [Morgan] of one-half of the\n$7,685 cost of the New Wall \u2013 i.e., $3,842.50. The March 24 letter\nagain threatened suit if payment was not made.\n\n[Morgan] commenced this action against the Association by Writ of\nSummons on October 2, 2018. Her Complaint, filed January 22, 2019,\nasserted five counts. Count I sought a declaratory judgment that, inter\nalia, [Morgan] is not responsible for one-half of the cost of replacing\nthe Old Wall and that the Association bears sole responsibility for the\nmaintenance, repair, and replacement of the New Wall as necessary.\nCount I also sought unspecified damages, punitive damages, and\nattorney fees. Counts II (injunctive relief), III (nuisance) and IV\n(breach of contract) sought injunctive relief and monetary damages,\nincluding attorney fees, on the ground that the New Wall was\ninadequate and needed to be replaced. Count V, for implied contract,\n\n\n                                   3\n\f         quasi-contract, and unjust enrichment, sought recovery of the\n         engineering fees that [Morgan] had incurred.\n\n         [A n]onjury trial was held on June 15 and 16, 2022. At the outset of\n         trial, it was agreed that any award of attorney fees incurred in\n         connection with the litigation would be reserved and would be raised\n         by motion after issuance of the Court\u2019s decision. That procedure was\n         reconfirmed at the close of the trial.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12/6/22, at 1-4 (footnotes, headnotes and internal citations\nomitted).\n         On June 23, 2022, the trial court issued its decision on the underlying dispute.\nThe trial court determined under the Uniform Planned Community Act (Act),2 the\nAssociation bore the sole responsibility for replacing the Old Wall and maintaining\nthe New Wall. Id. at 4. Therefore, it found in favor of Morgan on Count I, but did\nnot award compensatory damages because the Association had paid its contractor in\nfull for the replacement of the Old Wall, and it did not award punitive damages\nbecause it found the Association had not acted willfully. Id. at 6. On Counts II\nthrough IV, the trial court found the New Wall was structurally sound and in good\ncondition and did not need to be replaced. Id. Therefore, the trial court found in\nfavor of the Association. Id. Similarly, as to Count V, for unjust enrichment, the\ntrial court found in favor of the Association. Id. Neither party challenged the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision.\n         On July 5, 2022, both Morgan and the Association filed motions seeking an\naward of attorney fees and costs. Morgan sought an award of $280,066.13. The\nAssociation sought an award of approximately $81,860.80.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5414.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      In its Order, the trial court granted Morgan\u2019s request, in part, by awarding her\nattorney fees in the amount of $50,000. The trial court denied the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees entirely. The trial court explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n      In determining the parties\u2019 respective requests for fees and costs under\n      [S]ection 5412 of the [Act], the [trial court] has considered primarily\n      the following factors . . . .\n\n   \u2022 This dispute arose from the Association\u2019s repeated insistence that\n     [Morgan] bear one-half the expense of replacing the Old Wall and its\n     threats to sue her to recover that amount. As the [trial court\u2019s d]ecision\n     explains, while this position was apparently asserted by the Association\n     in good faith, it did not represent a reasonable interpretation of the Act.\n     But for the Association\u2019s position, it is possible that litigation would\n     have been avoided.\n\n   \u2022 At the same time, the [trial court] found [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall to be without sufficient supporting evidence.\n     These issues accounted for the great majority of time spent on discovery\n     and trial. [Morgan\u2019s] persistence in seeking to require the Association\n     to remove and rebuild the New Wall made settlement of this matter\n     especially difficult. Unlike the Association\u2019s position on the cost of\n     replacing the Old Wall, however, [Morgan\u2019s] challenges to the\n     adequacy of the New Wall were not unreasonable.\n\n   \u2022 In the attorney invoices submitted by [Morgan], the descriptions of the\n     subject matter of work performed are heavily redacted. As a result, the\n     allocation of time spent between the issues on which [Morgan]\n     prevailed and those on which she did not prevail is problematic.\n\n   \u2022 Section 5412 [of the Act] authorizes the [trial court], in a suit for\n     violation of the Act or the declaration or bylaws, to award costs and\n     reasonable attorney[] fees to the prevailing party \u201cif appropriate\u201d \u2013\n     language that vests the [trial court] with broad discretion. The\n     Association\u2019s reading of this provision \u2013 that it applies only when\n     punitive damages are awarded \u2013 is inconsistent with its language and\n     legislative history.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 12/6/22, at 8.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f       On September 9, 2022, Morgan filed a motion for partial reconsideration of\nthe trial court\u2019s Order and on September 12, 2022, the Association responded with\na cross-motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order. On September 19,\n2022, the trial court denied both motions for reconsideration.\n       Both Morgan and the Association now appeal to this Court. On appeal,\nMorgan argues the trial court committed an error of law and abused its discretion by\nawarding her only $50,000 in costs and attorney fees when the statute authorizing\nthe award of attorney fees compelled an award of $280,066.13. Morgan\u2019s Br. at 4.\nRegarding the Association\u2019s request for attorney fees, Morgan contends the trial\ncourt properly exercised its discretion in denying the Association\u2019s request because\nthe trial court determined the Association\u2019s conduct to be unreasonable and an award\nof attorney fees and costs would not be appropriate. Id. Meanwhile, the Association\nasserts the trial court erred and abused its discretion by denying the Association\u2019s\nmotion for attorney fees and expenses in its entirety when the Association acted in\ngood faith and prevailed on the majority of the initial claims. Association\u2019s Br. at 5.\nRegarding the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Morgan, the Association\ncontends the applicable statutory scheme did not compel the trial court to award the\nfull amount of requested attorney fees to Morgan and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in awarding $50,000 in attorney fees and costs.

Here, the parties\u2019 underlying dispute arose\nunder the Act and Section 5412 of the Act, which provides:\n\n      If a declarant or any other person subject to this subpart violates any\n      provision of this subpart or any provisions of the declaration or bylaws,\n      any person or class of persons adversely affected by the violation has a\n      claim for appropriate relief.

Moreover, the statute is clear that any award of attorney fees must be\nreasonable.\n       Generally, the courts retain discretion to determine what is reasonable when\nawarding attorney fees.

As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court outlined in In re Trust Estate of\nLaRocca,\n\n      the amount of fees to be allowed to counsel, always a subject of\n      delicacy if not difficulty, is one peculiarly within the discretion of the\n      court of first instance. Its opportunities of judging the exact amount of\n      labor, skill, and responsibility involved, as well as its knowledge of the\n      rate of professional compensation usual at the time and place, are\n      necessarily greater than ours[.]\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">246 A.2d 337</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (Pa. 1968) (citation omitted). Thus, a trial court\u2019s award should\nbe based on \u201call the circumstances\u201d of a case and it is up to the court to determine\nwhether certain tasks constitute a reasonable legal response to an action or, instead,\nhave an attenuated relation to the action.

Cmwlth. 2014)).\n         Initially, we reject Morgan\u2019s assertion that the plain language of the Act\nmandates she receive the full amount of her requested award. Morgan relies on\nSection 5114 of the Act,3 which provides the Act\u2019s provisions are to be \u201cliberally\nadministered to the end that the aggrieved party is put in as good a position as if the\nother party had fully performed.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114. Morgan contends this requires\nattorney fees authorized under Section 5412 of the Act \u201cmust be liberally awarded\nto make the aggrieved party whole.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 16. She interprets this to\nnecessitate an award equal to the full amount of her requested attorney fees.\nHowever, the plain language of the Act grants the trial court discretion whether to\naward attorney fees at all, and if it does, mandates the trial court to ensure awarded\n\n3\n    68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5114.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fattorney fees are reasonable. To interpret the Act as Morgan suggests would\nobliviate the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining the reasonableness of attorney\nfees. Because the plain language of the statute requires the trial court ensure awarded\nattorney fees are reasonable, Morgan\u2019s interpretation of the Act would lead to an\nabsurd result whereby a court would be required to award attorney fees paid by the\nparty, even when those fees were unreasonable. A party is free to pursue all means\nand costs necessary in litigation, but it does not necessarily follow that the fees and\ncosts incurred are reasonable.         Therefore, we decline to adopt Morgan\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Act, which is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\n      Similarly, we reject Morgan\u2019s arguments that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by reducing her award of attorney fees. When determining its fee award,\nthe trial court considered the relative degrees of success of the parties in the\nunderlying litigation, the complexities of the legal issues involved, and the amount\nof work performed and required by the attorneys involved.               The trial court\ndetermined that because Morgan only \u201cprevailed\u201d on one of the issues before the\ntrial court, which was a less complex issue, a reduced award was warranted under\nthe circumstances. Morgan asserts the trial court improperly considered the redacted\nbilling statements as a basis to depart from the requested fee award and its award\nwas \u201carbitrarily selected.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Br. at 37. However, the redacted billing\nstatement was just one of the various factors considered by the trial court. Overall,\nthe trial court was familiar with the underlying dispute, the litigation, and the parties.\nThe trial court considered appropriate factors when fashioning a fair and reasonable\nattorney fee. The trial court\u2019s decision was not manifestly unreasonable, and the\ntrial court did not act with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will. Accordingly, we\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscern no legal error or abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s award of $50,000 in\nattorney fees to Morgan.\n       Next, we turn to the Association\u2019s argument that the trial court erred or abused\nits discretion when it denied its request for attorney fees. The Association asserts\nbecause it prevailed on four out of five counts in the underlying dispute, the trial\ncourt erred by failing to award it attorney fees. The Association relies on this Court\u2019s\nholding in Serota v. London-Towne Homeowners\u2019 Association (Pa. Cmwlth., No.\n1451 C.D. 2017, filed Nov. 16, 2018).4 In Serota, an owner of numerous townhomes\nin a planned community filed suit against a homeowner\u2019s association challenging\nthe passage of an amendment that diluted the owner\u2019s voting power. Id., slip op. at\n1. After prevailing in the underlying dispute, the owner sought an award of attorney\nfees and costs under, inter alia, a previous version of Section 5412 of the Act, which\nnotably did not reference attorney fees. Id. The trial court rejected the owner\u2019s\nargument that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees and held the Act did not\nmandate an award of attorney fees. Id. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision. Id. In considering the language of the Act and the Uniform Law\nComment, we explained:\n\n       Contrary to [the owner\u2019s] contentions, however, neither the statutory\n       language of Section 5412 of the [Act] nor the Uniform Law Comment\n       mandate an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. As observed by [the trial court],\n       the statutory language at that time did not refer to attorneys\u2019 fees. And,\n       while the Uniform Law Comment does refer to attorneys\u2019 fees, such\n       reference is not binding on the court and, additionally, it considers the\n       award of such fees to be within the discretion of the court. Given the\n       parties\u2019 arguments before [the trial court], [the trial court] could have\n       exercised its discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees, but it was not\n       obligated to do so. We discern no abuse of discretion in [the trial\n\n4\n Under Section 414(a) of this Court\u2019s Internal Operating Procedures, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">210 Pa.

We disagree. Rather, our decision in\nSerota supports our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s determination. Here, just as in\nSerota, and as we explained above, the plain language of Section 5412 of the Act\ngrants the trial court discretion regarding whether to award attorney fees. We\nacknowledge the Association prevailed on numerous counts in the underlying\ndispute, but contrary to the Association\u2019s assertion, the Act does not mandate an\naward of attorney fees. The Association fails to point to any evidence in the record\nor any authority demonstrating the trial court\u2019s decision was manifestly\nunreasonable or the trial court acted with partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will in\ndenying its request. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to award the Association attorney fees.\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      The trial court did not err or abuse its discretion when it issued its Order\ngranting, in part, Morgan\u2019s request for attorney fees and denying the Association\u2019s\nrequest for attorney fees. The plain language of Section 5412 of the Act grants the\ntrial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party. Moreover, the Act\nmandates the trial court ensure an award of attorney fees is reasonable. The trial\ncourt, familiar with the litigation and parties in the underlying dispute, properly\nconsidered various factors, including the complexity of the litigation, the degree of\nsuccess of the parties, and the amount of work necessary for the attorneys to properly\n\n                                         13\n\fconduct the litigation, in fashioning its fee award. Neither party demonstrated the\ntrial court\u2019s decision was manifestly unreasonable or the trial court acted with\npartiality, prejudice, or ill-will. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion\nunder the circumstances of this case.

For the\nreasons that follow, we overrule in part and sustain in part Respondents\u2019 preliminary\nobjections.\n              The petition for review, titled \u201cpetition for writ in mandamus and/or\nextraordinary relief,\u201d alleges that Respondents failed to investigate, prosecute, or\ntake actions in response to a series of criminal assaults allegedly committed on\nWalker and Davis by Dwayne T. Jones. The petition further alleges that Petitioners\n\freported Respondents\u2019 alleged misconduct to the Office of Attorney General for\ninvestigation, which took no action.               The petition asks this Court to compel\nRespondents to initiate a criminal proceeding against Jones, and grant unspecified\ndamages and costs. The petition also asks this Court to compel the Office of\nAttorney General to initiate \u201can official internal investigation upon all factual\nallegations of said police/prosecutorial misconduct pursuant to [34] USC []\n12601(b).\u201d1 Petition for Review at 30.\n                 In response, Respondents filed preliminary objections.2 The District\nAttorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections challenge the petition on\nthe following grounds. First, they argue that Stambaugh lacks standing to sue\nbecause the petition does not allege that he was personally aggrieved by Jones\u2019\nalleged criminal conduct or Respondents\u2019 actions. Second, they argue that the\npetition fails to conform to law because Stambaugh, who is not an attorney, signed\nthe petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. Third, they assert that the County has\n\n\n1\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a712601 states:\n\n          (a) Unlawful conduct\n          It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any\n          person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or\n          practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any\n          governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice\n          or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or\n          immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n          (b) Civil action by Attorney General\n          Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of\n          paragraph (1) has occurred, the Attorney General, for or in the name of the United\n          States, may in a civil action obtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to\n          eliminate the pattern or practice.\n\n2\n    The Office of Attorney General has not filed preliminary objections or an answer in this matter.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fgovernmental immunity under Section 8541 of what is commonly known as the\nPolitical Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act),3 and the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice is protected by official immunity under Section 8545 of the Tort Claims Act4\nas well as quasi-judicial immunity. Finally, they argue that any allegations related\nto damages should be stricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity.\n               The Mayor\u2019s Office also filed preliminary objections, which likewise\nseek to dismiss the petition based on the foregoing grounds.5\n               Initially,\n\n               [i]n ruling on preliminary objections, we must accept as true all\n               well-pleaded material allegations in the petition for review, as\n               well as all inferences reasonably deduced therefrom. The Court\n               need not accept as true conclusions of law, unwarranted\n               inferences from facts, argumentative allegations, or expressions\n               of opinion. In order to sustain preliminary objections, it must\n               appear with certainty that the law will not permit recovery, and\n               any doubt should be resolved by a refusal to sustain them.\n\nTorres v. Beard, 997 A.2d 1242, 1245 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) (internal citation\nomitted). Further, \u201ccourts reviewing preliminary objections may not only consider\n\n\n3\n 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78541. It states, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency\nshall be liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act\nof the local agency or an employee thereof or any other person.\u201d\n4\n  42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78545. It states, \u201c[a]n employee of a local agency is liable for civil damages on\naccount of any injury to a person or property caused by acts of the employee which are within the\nscope of his office or duties only to the same extent as his employing local agency and subject to\nthe limitations imposed by this subchapter.\u201d\n5\n The Mayor\u2019s Office also sought to dismiss the petition for improper service. By order dated\nSeptember 28, 2022, the Court asked Petitioners to serve the petition, with all exhibits attached,\non Respondents in person or by certified mail as required by PA. R.A.P. 1514(c) and file with the\nCourt a certificate of service within 14 days. Petitioners did so on October 7, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fthe facts pled in the [petition for review], but also any documents or exhibits attached\nto it.\u201d Allen v. Department of Corrections, 103 A.3d 365, 369 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014).\n             With these principles in mind, we consider Respondents\u2019 preliminary\nobjections seriatim.\n                           I.      Stambaugh\u2019s Standing to Sue\n             First, Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenge Stambaugh\u2019s\nstanding to sue because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions. The petition alleges that Jones committed a\nseries of criminal assaults on Davis and Walker, and Respondents took no actions in\nresponse. As to Stambaugh, the petiton alleges that he filed a private criminal\ncomplaint on behalf of Walker with the District Attorney\u2019s Office. After the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office refused to take action, Stambaugh wrote letters to various\ngovernmental entities including the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Mayor\u2019s\nOffice, to which he received no response.\n             \u201c[A] person who is not adversely impacted by the matter he seeks to\nchallenge does not have standing to proceed with the court system\u2019s dispute\nresolution process.\u201d Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC v. Commonwealth, 888 A.2d\n655, 659 (Pa. 2005). \u201c[T]he requirement of standing arises from the principle that\njudicial intervention is appropriate only when the underlying controversy is real and\nconcrete,\u201d and \u201ca controversy is worthy of judicial review only if the individual\ninitiating the legal action has been \u2018aggrieved.\u2019\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\n             On November 15, 2022, almost three months after being served on the\npreliminary objections by the Mayor\u2019s Office, Petitioners submitted an amended\npetition for review alleging that Stambaugh is an aggrieved party and has a personal\ninterest in this matter.        Specifically, the amended petition alleges that Jones\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fcommitted criminal assault on Stambaugh by pointing a gun at him, but Respondents\nwrongfully prosecuted Stambaugh based on fabricated evidence. Pennsylvania Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 1516(b) provides that \u201c[e]very pleading filed after an\noriginal jurisdiction petition for review shall be filed within 30 days after service of\nthe preceding pleading[.]\u201d PA. R.A.P. 1516(b). Here, Petitioners filed the amended\npetition for review beyond the 30-day time frame without this Court\u2019s permission or\nconsent of Respondents; as such, we cannot consider Petitioners\u2019 amended petition\nas part of the pleadings.\n             Because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions, we sustain Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections\nand dismiss Stambaugh from this matter for his lack of standing to sue.\n                    II. Stambaugh\u2019s Authority to Bring Action\n             The District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections\nalso seek to dismiss the petition in its entirety because Stambaugh, who is not an\nattorney, signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. The petition does not\nallege that Stambaugh has a power of attorney to act on behalf of either Petitioner.\nA person who does not have authority to bring an action lacks the capacity to sue.\nIn re Estate of Sauers, 32 A.3d 1241, 1248-49 (Pa. 2011).\n             While Stambaugh signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis,\nthe record indicates that Walker and Davis each filed a letter on July 29, 2022, and\nAugust 4, 2022, in which they indicated their intention to represent themselves as\npro se and verified that all of the facts and information enclosed in the petition were\ntrue and correct to the best of their knowledge. Respondents did not object to the\nfiling of these two letters. Because Walker and Davis have indicated that they\nrepresent themselves in this matter, we overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthe County\u2019s preliminary objections challenging Stambaugh\u2019s authority to bring this\naction.\n                                  III. Immunity\n            Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections further assert that Petitioners are\nnot allowed to recover damages against them because such a claim is barred by\ngovernmental immunity and official immunity under Sections 8541 and 8545,\nrespectively, of the Tort Claims Act as well as quasi-judicial immunity.\n            However, the petition for review seeks mandamus relief, and \u201c[a]ctions\nin mandamus are not subject to the defense of sovereign immunity.\u201d Banfield v.\nCortes, 922 A.2d 36, 43 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2007) (citation omitted). This court has stated\nthat the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar suits that seek to compel an\nagency or officer to perform a ministerial or mandatory statutory duty. Id. (citing\nMilestone Materials, Inc. v. Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,\n730 A.2d 1034 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999), and City of Philadelphia v. Shapp, 403 A.2d\n1043 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1979)). Further, as a general matter, a successful plaintiff in a\nmandamus action is entitled to damages. Under Section 8303 of the Judicial Code,\na defendant in a mandamus action \u201cwho is adjudged . . . to have failed or refused\nwithout lawful justification to perform a duty required by law shall be liable in\ndamages to the person aggrieved by such failure or refusal.\u201d 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a78303. See\nalso Maurice A. Nernberg & Associations v. Coyne, 920 A.2d 967, 970 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2007).\n            Accordingly, we overrule Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections\nasserting governmental immunity, official immunity, and quasi-judicial immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                        IV. Lack of Specificity on Damages\n\n             Finally, Respondents argue that allegations on damages should be\nstricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity. Petitioners did not plead\nfacts to identify what damages were sustained that were caused by the alleged\nmisconduct of any of the Respondents.\n\n             A party must plead the material facts on which a cause of action is\nbased. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(a). Averments of time, place, and items of special damage\nshall be stated specifically. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(f). Pennsylvania Rule of Civil\nProcedure 1028(c)(3) authorizes Respondents to object to the petition for review on\nthe basis that it was insufficiently specific. PA. R.CIV.P. 1028(c)(3). \u201cThe purpose\nof a preliminary objection raising specificity is to ensure that an adverse party\u2019s\nability to answer and defend will not be unduly impaired by a pleader\u2019s vagueness\nin stating the grounds of his suit.\u201d Stilp v. Commonwealth, 910 A.2d 775, 786 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2006). \u201cThus, the purpose is to require the pleader to disclose the material\nfacts sufficient to enable the adverse party to prepare his or her case.\u201d Id.\n\n             The petition alleges that Jones committed a series of criminal assaults\non Davis and Walker, and Respondents took no actions despite Davis and Walker\u2019s\nreports of these crimes. The petition asks that this Court compel Respondents to\nperform their official duties by initiating a criminal proceeding against Jones, and\ngrant damages and costs. Because the petition does not specify what damages or\ncosts Petitioners sustained from Respondents\u2019 alleged actions, we sustain\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenging the claim for damages and costs as\ninsufficiently specific and strike those claims from the petititon.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we sustain in part and overrule in part\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections to the petition for review. Specifically, we\nsustain the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objection\nchallenging Stambaugh\u2019s standing to sue and dismiss Stambaugh from this matter\nas a petitioner. We overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s\npreliminary objection challenging Stambaugh\u2019s authority to bring this action\nbecause Walker and Davis have indicated to this Court that they represent\nthemselves in this matter. We overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the\nCounty\u2019s preliminary objection raising immunity because Petitioners are seeking\nmandamus relief. We sustain the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s\npreliminary objection raising a lack of specificity in the pleading and strike the claim\nfor damages and costs from the petition for review.\n\n             Likewise, we sustain the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary objections as to\nStambaugh\u2019s standing to sue.        We sustain the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary\nobjection raising a specificity challenge to Petitioners\u2019 claim for damages and costs.\nWe overrule the Mayor\u2019s Office\u2019s preliminary objection asserting immunity.\n\n\n                            _________________________________________________________\n                            MARY HANNAH LEAVITT, President Judge Emerita\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f          IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nTresa Walker, LaTorya Davis           :\nand Travis Stambaugh,                 :\n                 Petitioners          :\n            v.                        :        No. 300 M.D. 2022\n                                      :\nMifflin County District Attorneys     :\nOffice; Mayors Office for Borough :\nof (Lewistown); Office of Attorney :\nGenerals; Mifflin County &            :\nPennsylvania State Officials in their :\nofficial capacities,                  :\n                     Respondents      :\n\n\n\n                                     ORDER\n\n             AND NOW, this 19th day of January, 2024, the preliminary objections\nraised by the Mifflin County District Attorney\u2019s Office, Mayor\u2019s Office for Borough\nof Lewistown, and Mifflin County are SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in\npart in accordance with the foregoing opinion.

For the\nreasons that follow, we overrule in part and sustain in part Respondents\u2019 preliminary\nobjections.\n              The petition for review, titled \u201cpetition for writ in mandamus and/or\nextraordinary relief,\u201d alleges that Respondents failed to investigate, prosecute, or\ntake actions in response to a series of criminal assaults allegedly committed on\nWalker and Davis by Dwayne T. Jones. The petition further alleges that Petitioners\n\freported Respondents\u2019 alleged misconduct to the Office of Attorney General for\ninvestigation, which took no action.               The petition asks this Court to compel\nRespondents to initiate a criminal proceeding against Jones, and grant unspecified\ndamages and costs. The petition also asks this Court to compel the Office of\nAttorney General to initiate \u201can official internal investigation upon all factual\nallegations of said police/prosecutorial misconduct pursuant to [34] USC []\n12601(b).\u201d1 Petition for Review at 30.\n                 In response, Respondents filed preliminary objections.2 The District\nAttorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections challenge the petition on\nthe following grounds. First, they argue that Stambaugh lacks standing to sue\nbecause the petition does not allege that he was personally aggrieved by Jones\u2019\nalleged criminal conduct or Respondents\u2019 actions. Second, they argue that the\npetition fails to conform to law because Stambaugh, who is not an attorney, signed\nthe petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. Third, they assert that the County has\n\n\n1\n    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">34 U.S.C. \u00a712601</span><pre class=\"inline\"> states:\n\n          (a) Unlawful conduct\n          It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any\n          person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or\n          practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any\n          governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice\n          or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or\n          immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n          (b) Civil action by Attorney General\n          Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of\n          paragraph (1) has occurred, the Attorney General, for or in the name of the United\n          States, may in a civil action obtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to\n          eliminate the pattern or practice.\n\n2\n    The Office of Attorney General has not filed preliminary objections or an answer in this matter.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fgovernmental immunity under Section 8541 of what is commonly known as the\nPolitical Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act),3 and the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice is protected by official immunity under Section 8545 of the Tort Claims Act4\nas well as quasi-judicial immunity. Finally, they argue that any allegations related\nto damages should be stricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity.\n               The Mayor\u2019s Office also filed preliminary objections, which likewise\nseek to dismiss the petition based on the foregoing grounds.5\n               Initially,\n\n               [i]n ruling on preliminary objections, we must accept as true all\n               well-pleaded material allegations in the petition for review, as\n               well as all inferences reasonably deduced therefrom. The Court\n               need not accept as true conclusions of law, unwarranted\n               inferences from facts, argumentative allegations, or expressions\n               of opinion. In order to sustain preliminary objections, it must\n               appear with certainty that the law will not permit recovery, and\n               any doubt should be resolved by a refusal to sustain them.\n\nTorres v.

Stambaugh\u2019s Standing to Sue\n             First, Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenge Stambaugh\u2019s\nstanding to sue because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions. The petition alleges that Jones committed a\nseries of criminal assaults on Davis and Walker, and Respondents took no actions in\nresponse. As to Stambaugh, the petiton alleges that he filed a private criminal\ncomplaint on behalf of Walker with the District Attorney\u2019s Office. After the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office refused to take action, Stambaugh wrote letters to various\ngovernmental entities including the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Mayor\u2019s\nOffice, to which he received no response.\n             \u201c[A] person who is not adversely impacted by the matter he seeks to\nchallenge does not have standing to proceed with the court system\u2019s dispute\nresolution process.\u201d Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">888 A.2d\n655</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659 (Pa. 2005). \u201c[T]he requirement of standing arises from the principle that\njudicial intervention is appropriate only when the underlying controversy is real and\nconcrete,\u201d and \u201ca controversy is worthy of judicial review only if the individual\ninitiating the legal action has been \u2018aggrieved.\u2019\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (citations omitted).\n             On November 15, 2022, almost three months after being served on the\npreliminary objections by the Mayor\u2019s Office, Petitioners submitted an amended\npetition for review alleging that Stambaugh is an aggrieved party and has a personal\ninterest in this matter.        Specifically, the amended petition alleges that Jones\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fcommitted criminal assault on Stambaugh by pointing a gun at him, but Respondents\nwrongfully prosecuted Stambaugh based on fabricated evidence. Pennsylvania Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 1516(b) provides that \u201c[e]very pleading filed after an\noriginal jurisdiction petition for review shall be filed within 30 days after service of\nthe preceding pleading[.]\u201d PA. R.A.P. 1516(b). Here, Petitioners filed the amended\npetition for review beyond the 30-day time frame without this Court\u2019s permission or\nconsent of Respondents; as such, we cannot consider Petitioners\u2019 amended petition\nas part of the pleadings.\n             Because the petition for review does not allege that Stambaugh was\naggrieved by Respondents\u2019 actions, we sustain Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections\nand dismiss Stambaugh from this matter for his lack of standing to sue.\n                    II. Stambaugh\u2019s Authority to Bring Action\n             The District Attorney\u2019s Office and the County\u2019s preliminary objections\nalso seek to dismiss the petition in its entirety because Stambaugh, who is not an\nattorney, signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis. The petition does not\nallege that Stambaugh has a power of attorney to act on behalf of either Petitioner.\nA person who does not have authority to bring an action lacks the capacity to sue.\nIn re Estate of Sauers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">32 A.3d 1241</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1248-49 (Pa. 2011).\n             While Stambaugh signed the petition on behalf of Walker and Davis,\nthe record indicates that Walker and Davis each filed a letter on July 29, 2022, and\nAugust 4, 2022, in which they indicated their intention to represent themselves as\npro se and verified that all of the facts and information enclosed in the petition were\ntrue and correct to the best of their knowledge. Respondents did not object to the\nfiling of these two letters. Because Walker and Davis have indicated that they\nrepresent themselves in this matter, we overrule the District Attorney\u2019s Office and\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthe County\u2019s preliminary objections challenging Stambaugh\u2019s authority to bring this\naction.\n                                  III. Immunity\n            Respondents\u2019 preliminary objections further assert that Petitioners are\nnot allowed to recover damages against them because such a claim is barred by\ngovernmental immunity and official immunity under Sections 8541 and 8545,\nrespectively, of the Tort Claims Act as well as quasi-judicial immunity.\n            However, the petition for review seeks mandamus relief, and \u201c[a]ctions\nin mandamus are not subject to the defense of sovereign immunity.\u201d Banfield v.\nCortes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2074038\"><a href=\"/opinion/2074038/banfield-v-cortes/\">922 A.2d 36</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (Pa.

Lack of Specificity on Damages\n\n             Finally, Respondents argue that allegations on damages should be\nstricken from the petition due to insufficient specificity. Petitioners did not plead\nfacts to identify what damages were sustained that were caused by the alleged\nmisconduct of any of the Respondents.\n\n             A party must plead the material facts on which a cause of action is\nbased. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(a). Averments of time, place, and items of special damage\nshall be stated specifically. PA. R.CIV.P. 1019(f). Pennsylvania Rule of Civil\nProcedure 1028(c)(3) authorizes Respondents to object to the petition for review on\nthe basis that it was insufficiently specific. PA. R.CIV.P. 1028(c)(3). \u201cThe purpose\nof a preliminary objection raising specificity is to ensure that an adverse party\u2019s\nability to answer and defend will not be unduly impaired by a pleader\u2019s vagueness\nin stating the grounds of his suit.\u201d Stilp v.

The petition asks that this Court compel Respondents to\nperform their official duties by initiating a criminal proceeding against Jones, and\ngrant damages and costs. Because the petition does not specify what damages or\ncosts Petitioners sustained from Respondents\u2019 alleged actions, we sustain\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections challenging the claim for damages and costs as\ninsufficiently specific and strike those claims from the petititon.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we sustain in part and overrule in part\nRespondents\u2019 preliminary objections to the petition for review.

(\u201cAMW\u201d) appeals the trial court\u2019s order finding it in\n\n      contempt of an order compelling discovery responses. AMW raises one\n\n      dispositive issue, which we restate as: whether the contempt order must be\n\n      reversed because the trial court abused its discretion when it issued an order\n\n      compelling AMW to respond to the Town of Clarksville\u2019s (\u201cTown\u201d) discovery\n\n      requests without considering objections raised in AMW\u2019s First Supplemental\n\n      Answers.\n\n\n[2]   We reverse and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n[3]   AMW owns real estate located at 4505 Highway 31 East, Clarksville, Indiana,\n\n      and it leases the property to Midwest Entertainment Ventures, Inc. (d/b/a\n\n      Theatre X) (\u201cMEV\u201d),1 an adult entertainment venue. AMW and MEV share\n\n      the same principal business address in Michigan.\n\n\n[4]   In May 2019, Town revoked Theatre X\u2019s adult business license due to zoning\n\n      ordinance violations. On May 6, 2019, MEV filed a Petition of Appeal of\n\n      Revocation of Adult Entertainment License in the Clark Circuit Court. Town\n\n      filed an Answer to the Petition, as well as counterclaims against MEV and\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          MEV is not a party to this appeal, as Town\u2019s contempt motion was filed against AMW only.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                            Page 2 of 20\n\f      AMW, seeking, in part, a preliminary injunction enjoining MEV and AMW\n\n      from operating Theatre X in violation of zoning ordinances. MEV and AMW\n\n      then filed motions to dismiss Town\u2019s counterclaims and motion for preliminary\n\n      injunction.\n\n\n[5]   In November 2019, the trial court denied the motions to dismiss and granted\n\n      Town\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction placed\n\n      specific operating restrictions upon Theatre X, including limiting its hours of\n\n      operation. On December 19, AMW and MEV filed an interlocutory appeal of\n\n      the preliminary injunction order.\n\n\n[6]   On December 17, 2019, Town filed a motion in which it sought an order\n\n      imposing fines for AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s ordinance violations. In February 2020,\n\n      AMW and MEV served discovery documents upon Town. On February 25,\n\n      the trial court issued an order on Town\u2019s motion for fines, stating, in relevant\n\n      part, \u201c[b]ecause the Court\u2019s Order of November 21, 2019, is currently on\n\n      appeal, the Court finds it is without authority to order the relief sought by the\n\n      Town.\u201d Town\u2019s App. v. II at 194. However, because it found \u201cthese issues\n\n      may arise again,\u201d the trial court made six pages of findings related to the Town\n\n      having \u201cSatisfied Its Notice Obligations\u201d and AMW being \u201cjointly responsible\n\n      with MEV for the maintenance of Theatre X.\u201d Id. at 194, 198.\n\n\n[7]   Town provided responses to AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s discovery requests. On May\n\n      28, 2020, Town propounded its own discovery requests upon AMW and MEV;\n\n      specifically, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 3 of 20\n\f      for admissions. Thereafter, AMW requested and obtained an extension of time\n\n      in which to respond to the discovery requests. On July 15, 2020, AMW\n\n      submitted its responses to discovery, and, for each and every discovery request,\n\n      replied only:\n\n\n              AMW objects on the basis that discovery is premature and\n              inappropriate during the pendency of appeal. AMW has\n              consistently challenged the propriety of \u2018counterclaims\u2019 in the\n              context of an administrative or municipal appeal. That issue is\n              currently on appeal in the context of AMW\u2019S appeal of the Order\n              Granting Preliminary Injunction on November 21, 2019. The\n              Court explicitly noted in its February 25, 2020[,] Order\n              Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it presently lacks\n              authority during the pendency of the Appeal. This discovery\n              request was issued after the divesture of jurisdiction and during\n              the period jurisdiction was divested by way of appeal. All further\n              and additional objections are reserved.\n\n\n      August 12, 2021, Appealed Order Granting Motion to Compel at 2-3.\n\n\n[8]   After complying with the Trial Rule 26(F) requirement to attempt informal\n\n      resolution of the discovery dispute and reaching no such resolution, on August\n\n      28, 2020, Town filed a Motion to Compel discovery responses. In that motion,\n\n      Town noted, \u201cNor did MEV or AMW raise any substantive objection other\n\n      than \u2018jurisdiction was divested\u2019 by their appeal, and that the \u2018discovery request\n\n      was issued after the divestiture of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, MEV and AMW have\n\n      waived any objection other than the jurisdictional one.\u201d AMW App. v. II at\n\n      81. On September 4, 2020, AMW filed its response in which it argued only that\n\n      the trial court had been \u201cdivested of jurisdiction,\u201d id. at 89, over the case\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 4 of 20\n\f       because AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal was pending, and that \u201cany discovery\u201d\n\n       regarding issues raised on appeal \u201cis foreclosed as this Court currently lacks\n\n       jurisdiction over those issues,\u201d id. at 91. In a docket entry on September 23, the\n\n       trial court stated: \u201cBecause this case is on appeal, the trial court will not rule on\n\n       matters until the appeal has been decided.\u201d Id. at 16 (CCS).\n\n\n[9]    In October 2020, a panel of this Court affirmed the preliminary injunction in\n\n       Town\u2019s favor, and in March 2021, the Supreme Court denied transfer. Midwest\n\n       Ent. Ventures, Inc. v. Town of Clarksville, 158 N.E.3d 787, 789 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n       2020), trans. denied. On April 29, Town filed a reply brief in support of its\n\n       Motion to Compel Discovery. The reply brief argued that (1) the interlocutory\n\n       appeal had not stayed discovery, and (2) AMW had \u201cwaived all other\n\n       objections to the discovery requests\u201d by failing to raise them in any of its\n\n       discovery responses. AMW App. v. II at 107. Town devoted a three-paragraph\n\n       section of its brief to the latter argument.\n\n\n[10]   On that same date, the trial court held a pretrial conference and scheduled a\n\n       June 21, 2021, hearing on the motion to compel discovery, which was\n\n       subsequently rescheduled to July 8, 2021. Prior to the July 2021 hearing,\n\n       AMW did not file any additional briefing or other documents in response to\n\n       Town\u2019s claims that AMW had waived all objections other than jurisdiction.\n\n       On June 18, 2021, AMW tendered to Town its First Supplemental Responses\n\n       to Discovery, in which it raised multiple objections, including objections related\n\n       to relevance, attorney-client privilege, vagueness, overbreadth, unduly\n\n       burdensome requests, harassment, accountant-client privilege, and attorney\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 5 of 20\n\f       work product doctrine. On July 8, 2021, Town filed a supplemental brief in\n\n       support of its motion to compel, arguing again that AMW had waived any\n\n       discovery objection other than the original objection related to the trial court\u2019s\n\n       alleged lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n[11]   On July 9, the trial court conducted a hearing on Town\u2019s Motion to Compel\n\n       Discovery. On August 12, 2021, the trial court issued its \u201cFindings and Order\n\n       Granting Respondent[\u2019]s Motion to Compel Discovery.\u201d August 12, 2021,\n\n       Appealed Order at 1. The court order found that MEV\u2019s and AMW\u2019s theory\n\n       that they were not required to respond to discovery because the trial court\n\n       lacked jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal was pending was without\n\n       merit. In so holding, the trial court cited Indiana Appellate Rule 14(H), which\n\n       states in relevant part, \u201cAn interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in\n\n       the trial court unless the trial court or a judge of the Court of Appeals so\n\n       orders.\u201d Id. The trial court noted:\n\n\n               No judge of the Court of Appeals ordered a stay of proceedings.\n               Neither did this Court. The Court did note in its Order\n               Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it lacked authority\n               to grant the Town\u2019s request for $770,000 in fines during the\n               appeal (Feb. 25, 2020, Fines Order at 2), but it never stated it\n               lacked jurisdiction over the case or that any proceedings\n               (including discovery) were stayed. In fact, this Court ruled on\n               several matters in that same February 25, 2020[,] Order as the\n               Court found \u201cthese issues may arise again.\u201d (Id.)\n\n\n       Id. at 5-6.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 6 of 20\n\f[12]   The trial court also found that AMW and MEV had waived any discovery\n\n       objections that they had \u201cfailed to raise in their original responses.\u201d Id. at 6-7.\n\n       In support, the trial court noted that the discovery rules require a party\n\n       responding to discovery to answer the requests or else state an objection and the\n\n       reasons for the objection. The court also cited Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d\n\n       3, 6 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), as support for its finding that \u201c[a] party that fails to\n\n       timely assert that information is privileged or otherwise undiscoverable in his\n\n       response waives reliance on those objections.\u201d Id. at 6. The trial court ordered\n\n       AMW and MEV to answer Town\u2019s discovery requests within thirty days and\n\n       \u201cwithhold nothing on the basis of any objection that they failed to raise in their\n\n       initial responses.\u201d Id. at 7.\n\n\n[13]   On September 13, 2021, AMW tendered to Town its second supplemental\n\n       discovery responses. On November 8, 2021, Town filed a motion to hold\n\n       AMW2 in contempt of the court\u2019s August order compelling discovery responses.\n\n       On that same date, AMW filed an Affidavit with its Initial, First Supplemental,\n\n       and Second Supplemental discovery responses attached thereto. On January\n\n       18, 2023, AMW filed its response to Town\u2019s motion for contempt, referencing\n\n       the November 8 affidavit and attached supplemental discovery responses.\n\n\n[14]   The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion for contempt on January 19,\n\n       2023. In its February 7, 2023, order holding AMW in contempt of the August\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The Town did not file a similar motion against MEV.\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024          Page 7 of 20\n\f       12, 2021, order compelling discovery responses, the trial court specifically noted\n\n       that AMW\u2019s first supplemental responses that were tendered on June 18, 2021,\n\n       were \u201cbelated.\u201d Appealed February 7, 2023, Order at 4. The court reiterated\n\n       that, in complying with the order compelling discovery responses, AMW was\n\n       \u201cnot permitted to raise any objections, or withhold any information, when\n\n       producing discovery.\u201d Id. at 5. The trial court found that AMW had\n\n       \u201ccontinued to object, and withhold documents, based on relevance and\n\n       privilege[] objections that the Discovery Order held were waived.\u201d Id. at 7.\n\n       The court found that those actions had violated the Discovery Order.\n\n\n[15]   The trial court imposed upon AMW a $30,000 civil sanction \u201cto coerce\n\n       AMW\u2019s compliance with the Discovery Order,\u201d but noted that \u201cAMW can\n\n       avoid this fine by complying with the Discovery Order\u2014by fully answering the\n\n       Town\u2019s discovery requests, providing the entirety of every responsive\n\n       document, and withholding (including by redaction) nothing therefrom\u2014within\n\n       30 days of this Order.\u201d Id. at 9. The court also found AMW liable for Town\u2019s\n\n       attorney fees and expenses incurred in addressing AMW\u2019s failure to comply\n\n       with the Discovery Order. This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n       Discussion and Decision\n       Standard of Review\n[16]   AMW appeals the trial court\u2019s order finding it in contempt of the order\n\n       compelling discovery responses and, in so doing, challenges the underlying\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 8 of 20\n\f       order compelling discovery responses.3 We review those orders for an abuse of\n\n       discretion.\n\n\n               Trial courts \u201cstand much closer than an appellate court to the\n               currents of litigation pending before them,\u201d so they are better\n               positioned to assess and manage discovery matters.

Sawyer, 93 N.E.3d 745, 757 (Ind. 2018).\n\n\n       Timeliness of AMW\u2019s Discovery Responses\n[17]   AMW filed its initial discovery responses on July 15, 2020, and those responses\n\n       objected to the discovery requests solely on the grounds that the trial court\n\n       allegedly lacked jurisdiction to rule upon discovery while the interlocutory\n\n       appeal was pending. AMW admittedly raised no other objections in its initial\n\n       discovery response. However, on June 18, 2021, which was over two weeks\n\n       before the July 9 hearing on Town\u2019s motion to compel discovery, AMW\n\n       supplemented its discovery responses; in its First Supplemental Responses,\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         This Court has jurisdiction to review both the underlying order compelling discovery and the contempt\n       order. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Scroghan, 851 N.E.2d 317, 322 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006).\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                            Page 9 of 20\n\f       AMW raised additional discovery response objections, such as relevance and\n\n       attorney-client privilege. In its August 12, 2021, order compelling AMW to\n\n       respond to the discovery requests, the trial court found that AMW was not\n\n       permitted to rely upon any objection other than the one raised in its initial\u2014i.e.,\n\n       July 15, 2020\u2014discovery response. Thus, the trial court refused to consider any\n\n       of the objections AMW raised in its June 18 supplemental discovery response.\n\n       It is that decision which AMW now appeals.4\n\n\n[18]   Pursuant to Trial Rule 26(B)(1), a party \u201cmay obtain discovery regarding any\n\n       matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject-matter involved in the\n\n       pending action whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking\n\n       discovery or the claim or defense of any other party[.]\u201d The purpose of\n\n       Indiana\u2019s discovery rules is \u201cto allow a liberal discovery procedure\u201d for the\n\n       purposes of providing litigants \u201cwith information essential to the litigation of all\n\n       relevant issues, eliminat[ing] surprise[,] and \u2026 promot[ing] settlement.\u201d\n\n       Canfield v. Sandock, 563 N.E.2d 526, 528 (Ind. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         AMW argues, in addition, that its jurisdictional objection in its initial discovery response was correct;\n       however, we hold that objection was clearly incorrect, as no stay of the proceedings had been issued. See Ind.\n       Appellate Rule 14(H) (\u201cAn interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in the trial court unless the trial\n       court or a judge of the Court of Appeals so orders.\u201d); Battering v. State, 150 N.E.3d 597, 602 (Ind. 2020)\n       (emphasis original) (\u201cA plain reading of [Indiana Appellate Rule 14(H)] provides that an interlocutory appeal\n       only constitutes a stay if the trial court or the Court of Appeals so orders.\u201d).\n       AMW also argues on appeal that the Town waived its claim that AMW waived any objections not contained\n       in its original discovery response, e.g., relevance. AMW asserts that Town waived that claim by not\n       sufficiently raising it in the trial court. However, that assertion is incorrect, as Town clearly raised the waiver\n       argument in both its August 28, 2020, Motion to Compel and its April 29, 2021, Reply Brief in Support of\n       Motion to Compel. See AMW\u2019s App. at 81; Town\u2019s App. v. II at 234-238.

See Outback Steakhouse of Fla.,\n\n       Inc. v. Markley, 856 N.E.2d 65, 78 (Ind. 2006).\n\n\n[21]   Here, AMW\u2019s timely7 discovery responses in its July 15, 2020, initial response\n\n       addressed only the alleged lack of jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal\n\n       was pending and did not raise other objections. When the parties received the\n\n       new information that the appeal had ended, it became clear that the objections\n\n       based on jurisdiction, even if they had been correct when made (which they\n\n       were not), were moot. Therefore, AMW supplemented its discovery responses\n\n       with its additional responses, including new objections.8 See T.R. 26(E)(a), (b).\n\n       Trial Rule 26(E) allows such supplementation of discovery responses, and there\n\n       was no deadline imposed in this case, either by the court or agreement of the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         In fact, even responses that were \u201ccomplete when made\u201d must be supplemented if they become incorrect or\n       relate to witnesses and persons with discoverable knowledge. See T.R. 26(E)(1), (2).\n       7\n         AMW had obtained an extension of time to respond to discovery requests, up to and including July 15,\n       2020.\n       8\n         The concurrence would hold that the rule regarding supplementation of discovery is not even applicable to\n       AMW\u2019s June 18, 2021, supplemental answers because there was no \u201cnew information\u201d that would allow or\n       require supplementation. However, as we note above, the relevant new information in this case was the final\n       denial of AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal. That new information made it clear that AMW\u2019s initial discovery\n       responses based on the alleged \u201cdivestment\u201d of jurisdiction pending the interlocutory appeal was no longer\n       applicable and that supplemental responses were required. Thus, we analyze the timeliness of AMW\u2019s June\n       18, 2021, supplemental responses under Trial Rule 26 rather attempting to create a new balancing test for\n       \u201cuntimely\u201d responses under Rules 33, 34, and 37, as the concurrence suggests.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                           Page 12 of 20\n\f       parties, for supplementing discovery responses. See T.R. 16(A), (J) (regarding\n\n       pre-trial conferences and orders). Therefore, AMW\u2019s supplemental responses,\n\n       filed before the hearing and the decision on Town\u2019s motion to compel, were\n\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d and permissible.9 T.R. 26(E). The trial court abused its discretion\n\n       when it refused to consider AMW\u2019s supplemental discovery responses. And\n\n       AMW was prejudiced by that error; not only was it limited to objections that\n\n       had become moot, but it was required to provide full responses to discovery\n\n       without the court\u2019s consideration of any of its supplemental objections.\n\n\n[22]   Both the trial court and Town pointed to Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d 3, 6\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), as support for AMW\u2019s alleged waiver of any discovery\n\n       responses other than its original responses. However, this reliance is misplaced.\n\n       Marshall correctly held that any issue\u2014including discovery responses\u2014not\n\n       raised in the trial court until a motion to correct error or appeal is waived as\n\n       untimely. Id. at 8. However, that is not the situation in the case before us;\n\n       AMW raised its additional objections to the discovery requests before the July\n\n       2021 hearing and August 2021 order compelling discovery and well before the\n\n       February 2023 order finding it in contempt of the discovery order. Marshall is\n\n       inapposite.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         AMW waited approximately three months to file its supplemental discovery responses after it obtained the\n       \u201cnew information\u201d that its interlocutory appeal had failed. Some may opine that three months is not\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d per Rule 26(E), although we note that Town has not made that particular argument. However,\n       as the rule does not provide a time limit for what is \u201cseasonable,\u201d there was no discovery deadline in this\n       case, and the supplemental response was filed weeks before the hearing on the motion to compel, we\n       conclude that the supplemental responses were \u201cseasonably\u201d provided.

See\n\n       Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) (interrogatory rule stating that \u201cany ground not stated\n\n       in a timely objection is waived\u201d);11 see also, e.g., Byrd v. Reno, No. Civ.A.96 2375,\n\n       1998 WL 429676, *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 1998) (\u201cA failure to file a timely\n\n       objection to interrogatories constitutes a waiver of any objection unless good\n\n       cause is shown.\u201d). However, this begs the question of what constitutes a\n\n       \u201ctimely\u201d objection. None of the cases\u2014either state or federal\u2014cited by Town\n\n       prohibit consideration of supplemental discovery responses provided prior to a\n\n       hearing and order on a motion to compel, when there was no deadline in place\n\n       for supplementing discovery responses.12\n\n\n\n                                                    Conclusion\n[24]   AWM\u2019s supplemental discovery responses, including objections, were timely\n\n       submitted, as they were provided before the hearing on Town\u2019s motion to\n\n       compel discovery responses and there was no deadline in this case that required\n\n       an earlier supplementation of discovery responses.

It appears to me that the majority reaches the\n\n       conclusion that AMW\u2019s objections, raised in its Supplemental Response, were\n\n       not waived because they were not untimely. First, I believe AMW\u2019s objections,\n\n       raised in its Supplemental Response, were late and untimely. However and\n\n       secondly, I believe that a late-raised objection does not necessarily result in a\n\n       waiver of that objection. Finally, I believe Marshall v. Woodruff provides the\n\n       outer boundaries for when a late objection can be deemed waived. Marshall\n\n       does not stand for the proposition that waiver of an objection only occurs when\n\n       a late-raised objection gets raised at the motion-to-correct-error stage. Here, we\n\n       need to determine when the late-raised objections can be found to be waived.\n\n\n[27]   To start, I believe that the timeliness and waiver of an objection to a discovery\n\n       request are separate questions requiring separate analyses. In other words, I do\n\n       not believe an untimely objection to a discovery request necessarily waives that\n\n       objection.\n\n\n[28]   In support of its untimeliness-equals-waiver argument, Town references the\n\n       Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Admittedly, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n       33 contains a blanket waiver provision. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) (\u201cAny\n\n       ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for good\n\n       cause, excuses the failure.\u201d) Federal case law has expanded that waiver\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 16 of 20\n\f       provision to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 34. See Boles v. Aramark Correctional\n\n       Svcs., LLC, 2018 WL 3854143 (6th Cir. 2018). However, the Indiana Trial Rules\n\n       do not include an equivalent\u2014or any\u2014waiver provision in Rules 33, 34, or 36.\n\n       The argument that we should look to the federal rules for guidance on whether\n\n       an untimely discovery objection is waived is not persuasive.\n\n\n[29]   Because our trial rules do not specify that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, and lacking any relevant guidance from the federal\n\n       counterpart to those rules, I disagree that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is necessarily waived. This determination of whether a late-submitted\n\n       objection is waived should be decided by the trial court based upon facts and\n\n       circumstances of the case as I will explain below.\n\n\n[30]   Secondly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that AMW\u2019s objection was\n\n       timely and with its reasoning that there was no deadline for making such an\n\n       objection. The majority opinion is based on Trial Rule 26(E), which allows for\n\n       supplementing a discovery response. However, Trial Rule 26(E) prescribes the\n\n       duty to supplement a prior response in the event of \u201cinformation thereafter\n\n       acquired.\u201d T.R. 26(E). There is no indication that the objections here arise\n\n       from or are based on information acquired after AMW filed its initial objection\n\n       on July 15, 2020. As a matter of fact, it appears that AMW knew all along that\n\n       its subsequently (and late-) raised objections could be asserted, they simply\n\n       chose not to do so. As a result, I do not believe Trial Rule 26(E) applies.\n\n       Instead, I believe the timeliness of an objection to a discovery request is more\n\n       appropriately governed by the trial rules, here, Trial Rule 33, 34, and 36.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024     Page 17 of 20\n\f[31]   Under our trial rules, the deadline for responding to a discovery request is set in\n\n       the rule regarding the type of discovery at issue. See Ind. Trial Rule 33(B)\n\n       (\u201cAnswers or objections to interrogatories shall include the interrogatory . . . to\n\n       which an objection is being made. . . . [R]easons for objections shall be stated in\n\n       lieu of an answer.\u201d); T.R. 33(C) (requiring responding party to serve \u201canswers\n\n       or objections within a period designated by the party submitting the\n\n       interrogatories, not less than thirty [30] days after service\u201d); T.R. 34(B)\n\n       (requiring written response to requests for production of documents, including\n\n       objections, within \u201ca period designated in the request, not less than thirty [30]\n\n       days after the service thereof\u201d); T.R. 36 (deeming admitted any request for\n\n       admission not answered or objected to \u201cwithin a period designated in the\n\n       request, not less than thirty [30] days after service thereof\u201d). The deadlines for\n\n       discovery responses, including objections, in those rules should be applied in\n\n       this case.\n\n\n[32]   Here, AMW served its amended objections after the 30-day deadline set in the\n\n       relevant trial rules, beyond any extension granted in a trial court order or\n\n       allowed by Town, and more than 30 days after the Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       denied transfer of the interlocutory appeal. As a result, I believe the objections\n\n       AMW asserted in its June 2021 first supplemental responses were not timely.\n\n\n[33]   Finally, although I would find AMW\u2019s new objections to be untimely, I do not\n\n       believe that AMW has waived those objections or that Marshall v. Woodruff\n\n       requires a contrary conclusion. Marshall responded to a motion to compel\n\n       discovery on the ground that the requested information was \u201cunavailable.\u201d\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 18 of 20\n\f       Marshall v. Woodruff, 631 N.E.2d 3, 6 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994). Ultimately, the trial\n\n       court dismissed Marshall\u2019s complaint for \u201cnon-compliance with discovery.\u201d Id.\n\n       at 5. Marshall then filed a motion to correct error, asserting for the first time an\n\n       objection to the discovery requested on the ground that it was privileged or\n\n       otherwise undiscoverable. Id. at 6. \u201cPrior to her motion to correct errors,\n\n       Marshall never contended the information was privileged or otherwise\n\n       undiscoverable as it related to the issue of damages. Marshall cannot now rely\n\n       on these untimely reasons for objection.\u201d Id. In support, the court cited T.R.\n\n       34(B) and Rodgers v. Rodgers, 503 N.E.2d 1255, 1257 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987),\n\n       which held that a party may not raise in a motion to correct error or on appeal\n\n       an issue not raised in the trial court. In sum, Marshall tells us that an untimely\n\n       objection is waived when it is asserted for the first time in a motion to correct\n\n       error or later.\n\n\n[34]   Here, as the majority explains, AMW\u2019s objections were raised prior to the\n\n       hearing on the Motion to Compel; in other words, much sooner than at the\n\n       motion-to-correct-error stage. This begs the question, when does a late-raised\n\n       objection become waived. I would suggest the following factors are relevant to\n\n       that inquiry. To determine whether an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, I believe courts should consider factors such as these:\n\n\n               1. the obstreperousness of the party;\n\n\n               2. the complexity (or lack thereof) of the issues;\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 19 of 20\n\f               3. the amount of time that passed between a motion to compel\n               and the hearing on that motion;\n\n\n               4. the amount of time, effort, and/or expense the requesting\n               party put into trying to get the issue resolved (e.g., T.R. 26(F)\n               efforts); and\n\n\n               5. good cause.\n\n\n[35]   Applying such an analysis to this case, I believe that AMW\u2019s supplemental\n\n       responses (the late-raised objections) were late for the reasons explained above,\n\n       but I would hold that those objections are not waived given: (1) the rare and\n\n       unusual circumstances of this case, namely, the confusion created by the\n\n       interlocutory appeal as to whether the trial court retained authority over the\n\n       matter; (2) the lack of evidence that either party was being obstreperous; (3) the\n\n       lack of any real effort by Town to resolve the issue, given that Town only sent a\n\n       single letter to AMW pursuant to T.R. 26(F); (4) the fact that Town\u2019s Motion\n\n       to Compel was filed on August 28, 2020, and the hearing on that motion did\n\n       not occur until July 9, 2021; and (5) the fact that the amended/supplemented\n\n       objections were filed prior to the hearing on the motion to compel.\n\n\n[36]   For these reasons, I concur and would also reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024         Page 20 of 20\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                                 FILED\n                                                                            Jan 19 2024, 9:18 am\n\n                                                                                 CLERK\n                                                                             Indiana Supreme Court\n                                                                                Court of Appeals\n                                                                                  and Tax Court\n\n\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT                                     ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEE\nAMW INVESTMENTS, INC.

(\u201cAMW\u201d) appeals the trial court\u2019s order finding it in\n\n      contempt of an order compelling discovery responses. AMW raises one\n\n      dispositive issue, which we restate as: whether the contempt order must be\n\n      reversed because the trial court abused its discretion when it issued an order\n\n      compelling AMW to respond to the Town of Clarksville\u2019s (\u201cTown\u201d) discovery\n\n      requests without considering objections raised in AMW\u2019s First Supplemental\n\n      Answers.\n\n\n[2]   We reverse and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n[3]   AMW owns real estate located at 4505 Highway 31 East, Clarksville, Indiana,\n\n      and it leases the property to Midwest Entertainment Ventures, Inc. (d/b/a\n\n      Theatre X) (\u201cMEV\u201d),1 an adult entertainment venue. AMW and MEV share\n\n      the same principal business address in Michigan.\n\n\n[4]   In May 2019, Town revoked Theatre X\u2019s adult business license due to zoning\n\n      ordinance violations. On May 6, 2019, MEV filed a Petition of Appeal of\n\n      Revocation of Adult Entertainment License in the Clark Circuit Court. Town\n\n      filed an Answer to the Petition, as well as counterclaims against MEV and\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          MEV is not a party to this appeal, as Town\u2019s contempt motion was filed against AMW only.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                            Page 2 of 20\n\f      AMW, seeking, in part, a preliminary injunction enjoining MEV and AMW\n\n      from operating Theatre X in violation of zoning ordinances. MEV and AMW\n\n      then filed motions to dismiss Town\u2019s counterclaims and motion for preliminary\n\n      injunction.\n\n\n[5]   In November 2019, the trial court denied the motions to dismiss and granted\n\n      Town\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction placed\n\n      specific operating restrictions upon Theatre X, including limiting its hours of\n\n      operation. On December 19, AMW and MEV filed an interlocutory appeal of\n\n      the preliminary injunction order.\n\n\n[6]   On December 17, 2019, Town filed a motion in which it sought an order\n\n      imposing fines for AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s ordinance violations. In February 2020,\n\n      AMW and MEV served discovery documents upon Town. On February 25,\n\n      the trial court issued an order on Town\u2019s motion for fines, stating, in relevant\n\n      part, \u201c[b]ecause the Court\u2019s Order of November 21, 2019, is currently on\n\n      appeal, the Court finds it is without authority to order the relief sought by the\n\n      Town.\u201d Town\u2019s App. v. II at 194. However, because it found \u201cthese issues\n\n      may arise again,\u201d the trial court made six pages of findings related to the Town\n\n      having \u201cSatisfied Its Notice Obligations\u201d and AMW being \u201cjointly responsible\n\n      with MEV for the maintenance of Theatre X.\u201d Id. at 194, 198.\n\n\n[7]   Town provided responses to AMW\u2019s and MEV\u2019s discovery requests. On May\n\n      28, 2020, Town propounded its own discovery requests upon AMW and MEV;\n\n      specifically, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 3 of 20\n\f      for admissions. Thereafter, AMW requested and obtained an extension of time\n\n      in which to respond to the discovery requests. On July 15, 2020, AMW\n\n      submitted its responses to discovery, and, for each and every discovery request,\n\n      replied only:\n\n\n              AMW objects on the basis that discovery is premature and\n              inappropriate during the pendency of appeal. AMW has\n              consistently challenged the propriety of \u2018counterclaims\u2019 in the\n              context of an administrative or municipal appeal. That issue is\n              currently on appeal in the context of AMW\u2019S appeal of the Order\n              Granting Preliminary Injunction on November 21, 2019. The\n              Court explicitly noted in its February 25, 2020[,] Order\n              Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it presently lacks\n              authority during the pendency of the Appeal. This discovery\n              request was issued after the divesture of jurisdiction and during\n              the period jurisdiction was divested by way of appeal. All further\n              and additional objections are reserved.\n\n\n      August 12, 2021, Appealed Order Granting Motion to Compel at 2-3.\n\n\n[8]   After complying with the Trial Rule 26(F) requirement to attempt informal\n\n      resolution of the discovery dispute and reaching no such resolution, on August\n\n      28, 2020, Town filed a Motion to Compel discovery responses. In that motion,\n\n      Town noted, \u201cNor did MEV or AMW raise any substantive objection other\n\n      than \u2018jurisdiction was divested\u2019 by their appeal, and that the \u2018discovery request\n\n      was issued after the divestiture of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, MEV and AMW have\n\n      waived any objection other than the jurisdictional one.\u201d AMW App. v. II at\n\n      81. On September 4, 2020, AMW filed its response in which it argued only that\n\n      the trial court had been \u201cdivested of jurisdiction,\u201d id. at 89, over the case\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 4 of 20\n\f       because AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal was pending, and that \u201cany discovery\u201d\n\n       regarding issues raised on appeal \u201cis foreclosed as this Court currently lacks\n\n       jurisdiction over those issues,\u201d id. at 91. In a docket entry on September 23, the\n\n       trial court stated: \u201cBecause this case is on appeal, the trial court will not rule on\n\n       matters until the appeal has been decided.\u201d Id. at 16 (CCS).\n\n\n[9]    In October 2020, a panel of this Court affirmed the preliminary injunction in\n\n       Town\u2019s favor, and in March 2021, the Supreme Court denied transfer.

On April 29, Town filed a reply brief in support of its\n\n       Motion to Compel Discovery. The reply brief argued that (1) the interlocutory\n\n       appeal had not stayed discovery, and (2) AMW had \u201cwaived all other\n\n       objections to the discovery requests\u201d by failing to raise them in any of its\n\n       discovery responses. AMW App. v. II at 107. Town devoted a three-paragraph\n\n       section of its brief to the latter argument.\n\n\n[10]   On that same date, the trial court held a pretrial conference and scheduled a\n\n       June 21, 2021, hearing on the motion to compel discovery, which was\n\n       subsequently rescheduled to July 8, 2021. Prior to the July 2021 hearing,\n\n       AMW did not file any additional briefing or other documents in response to\n\n       Town\u2019s claims that AMW had waived all objections other than jurisdiction.\n\n       On June 18, 2021, AMW tendered to Town its First Supplemental Responses\n\n       to Discovery, in which it raised multiple objections, including objections related\n\n       to relevance, attorney-client privilege, vagueness, overbreadth, unduly\n\n       burdensome requests, harassment, accountant-client privilege, and attorney\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 5 of 20\n\f       work product doctrine. On July 8, 2021, Town filed a supplemental brief in\n\n       support of its motion to compel, arguing again that AMW had waived any\n\n       discovery objection other than the original objection related to the trial court\u2019s\n\n       alleged lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n[11]   On July 9, the trial court conducted a hearing on Town\u2019s Motion to Compel\n\n       Discovery. On August 12, 2021, the trial court issued its \u201cFindings and Order\n\n       Granting Respondent[\u2019]s Motion to Compel Discovery.\u201d August 12, 2021,\n\n       Appealed Order at 1. The court order found that MEV\u2019s and AMW\u2019s theory\n\n       that they were not required to respond to discovery because the trial court\n\n       lacked jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal was pending was without\n\n       merit. In so holding, the trial court cited Indiana Appellate Rule 14(H), which\n\n       states in relevant part, \u201cAn interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in\n\n       the trial court unless the trial court or a judge of the Court of Appeals so\n\n       orders.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> The trial court noted:\n\n\n               No judge of the Court of Appeals ordered a stay of proceedings.\n               Neither did this Court. The Court did note in its Order\n               Regarding Motion for Imposition of Fines that it lacked authority\n               to grant the Town\u2019s request for $770,000 in fines during the\n               appeal (Feb. 25, 2020, Fines Order at 2), but it never stated it\n               lacked jurisdiction over the case or that any proceedings\n               (including discovery) were stayed. In fact, this Court ruled on\n               several matters in that same February 25, 2020[,] Order as the\n               Court found \u201cthese issues may arise again.\u201d (Id.)\n\n\n       Id. at 5-6.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024        Page 6 of 20\n\f[12]   The trial court also found that AMW and MEV had waived any discovery\n\n       objections that they had \u201cfailed to raise in their original responses.\u201d Id. at 6-7.\n\n       In support, the trial court noted that the discovery rules require a party\n\n       responding to discovery to answer the requests or else state an objection and the\n\n       reasons for the objection. The court also cited Marshall v. Woodruff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981654/marshall-v-woodruff/\">631 N.E.2d\n\n       3</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (Ind. Ct.

Markley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">856 N.E.2d 65</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (Ind. 2006).\n\n\n[21]   Here, AMW\u2019s timely7 discovery responses in its July 15, 2020, initial response\n\n       addressed only the alleged lack of jurisdiction while the interlocutory appeal\n\n       was pending and did not raise other objections. When the parties received the\n\n       new information that the appeal had ended, it became clear that the objections\n\n       based on jurisdiction, even if they had been correct when made (which they\n\n       were not), were moot. Therefore, AMW supplemented its discovery responses\n\n       with its additional responses, including new objections.8 See T.R. 26(E)(a), (b).\n\n       Trial Rule 26(E) allows such supplementation of discovery responses, and there\n\n       was no deadline imposed in this case, either by the court or agreement of the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         In fact, even responses that were \u201ccomplete when made\u201d must be supplemented if they become incorrect or\n       relate to witnesses and persons with discoverable knowledge. See T.R. 26(E)(1), (2).\n       7\n         AMW had obtained an extension of time to respond to discovery requests, up to and including July 15,\n       2020.\n       8\n         The concurrence would hold that the rule regarding supplementation of discovery is not even applicable to\n       AMW\u2019s June 18, 2021, supplemental answers because there was no \u201cnew information\u201d that would allow or\n       require supplementation. However, as we note above, the relevant new information in this case was the final\n       denial of AMW\u2019s interlocutory appeal. That new information made it clear that AMW\u2019s initial discovery\n       responses based on the alleged \u201cdivestment\u201d of jurisdiction pending the interlocutory appeal was no longer\n       applicable and that supplemental responses were required. Thus, we analyze the timeliness of AMW\u2019s June\n       18, 2021, supplemental responses under Trial Rule 26 rather attempting to create a new balancing test for\n       \u201cuntimely\u201d responses under Rules 33, 34, and 37, as the concurrence suggests.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024                           Page 12 of 20\n\f       parties, for supplementing discovery responses. See T.R. 16(A), (J) (regarding\n\n       pre-trial conferences and orders). Therefore, AMW\u2019s supplemental responses,\n\n       filed before the hearing and the decision on Town\u2019s motion to compel, were\n\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d and permissible.9 T.R. 26(E). The trial court abused its discretion\n\n       when it refused to consider AMW\u2019s supplemental discovery responses. And\n\n       AMW was prejudiced by that error; not only was it limited to objections that\n\n       had become moot, but it was required to provide full responses to discovery\n\n       without the court\u2019s consideration of any of its supplemental objections.\n\n\n[22]   Both the trial court and Town pointed to Marshall v. Woodruff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981654/marshall-v-woodruff/\">631 N.E.2d 3</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), as support for AMW\u2019s alleged waiver of any discovery\n\n       responses other than its original responses. However, this reliance is misplaced.\n\n       Marshall correctly held that any issue\u2014including discovery responses\u2014not\n\n       raised in the trial court until a motion to correct error or appeal is waived as\n\n       untimely. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981654/marshall-v-woodruff/\">Id. at 8</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, that is not the situation in the case before us;\n\n       AMW raised its additional objections to the discovery requests before the July\n\n       2021 hearing and August 2021 order compelling discovery and well before the\n\n       February 2023 order finding it in contempt of the discovery order. Marshall is\n\n       inapposite.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         AMW waited approximately three months to file its supplemental discovery responses after it obtained the\n       \u201cnew information\u201d that its interlocutory appeal had failed. Some may opine that three months is not\n       \u201cseasonable\u201d per Rule 26(E), although we note that Town has not made that particular argument. However,\n       as the rule does not provide a time limit for what is \u201cseasonable,\u201d there was no discovery deadline in this\n       case, and the supplemental response was filed weeks before the hearing on the motion to compel, we\n       conclude that the supplemental responses were \u201cseasonably\u201d provided.

It appears to me that the majority reaches the\n\n       conclusion that AMW\u2019s objections, raised in its Supplemental Response, were\n\n       not waived because they were not untimely. First, I believe AMW\u2019s objections,\n\n       raised in its Supplemental Response, were late and untimely. However and\n\n       secondly, I believe that a late-raised objection does not necessarily result in a\n\n       waiver of that objection. Finally, I believe Marshall v. Woodruff provides the\n\n       outer boundaries for when a late objection can be deemed waived. Marshall\n\n       does not stand for the proposition that waiver of an objection only occurs when\n\n       a late-raised objection gets raised at the motion-to-correct-error stage. Here, we\n\n       need to determine when the late-raised objections can be found to be waived.\n\n\n[27]   To start, I believe that the timeliness and waiver of an objection to a discovery\n\n       request are separate questions requiring separate analyses. In other words, I do\n\n       not believe an untimely objection to a discovery request necessarily waives that\n\n       objection.\n\n\n[28]   In support of its untimeliness-equals-waiver argument, Town references the\n\n       Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Admittedly, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n       33 contains a blanket waiver provision. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) (\u201cAny\n\n       ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for good\n\n       cause, excuses the failure.\u201d) Federal case law has expanded that waiver\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 16 of 20\n\f       provision to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 34. See Boles v. Aramark Correctional\n\n       Svcs., LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 WL 3854143</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2018). However, the Indiana Trial Rules\n\n       do not include an equivalent\u2014or any\u2014waiver provision in Rules 33, 34, or 36.\n\n       The argument that we should look to the federal rules for guidance on whether\n\n       an untimely discovery objection is waived is not persuasive.\n\n\n[29]   Because our trial rules do not specify that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, and lacking any relevant guidance from the federal\n\n       counterpart to those rules, I disagree that an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is necessarily waived. This determination of whether a late-submitted\n\n       objection is waived should be decided by the trial court based upon facts and\n\n       circumstances of the case as I will explain below.\n\n\n[30]   Secondly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that AMW\u2019s objection was\n\n       timely and with its reasoning that there was no deadline for making such an\n\n       objection. The majority opinion is based on Trial Rule 26(E), which allows for\n\n       supplementing a discovery response. However, Trial Rule 26(E) prescribes the\n\n       duty to supplement a prior response in the event of \u201cinformation thereafter\n\n       acquired.\u201d T.R. 26(E). There is no indication that the objections here arise\n\n       from or are based on information acquired after AMW filed its initial objection\n\n       on July 15, 2020. As a matter of fact, it appears that AMW knew all along that\n\n       its subsequently (and late-) raised objections could be asserted, they simply\n\n       chose not to do so. As a result, I do not believe Trial Rule 26(E) applies.\n\n       Instead, I believe the timeliness of an objection to a discovery request is more\n\n       appropriately governed by the trial rules, here, Trial Rule 33, 34, and 36.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024     Page 17 of 20\n\f[31]   Under our trial rules, the deadline for responding to a discovery request is set in\n\n       the rule regarding the type of discovery at issue.

[R]easons for objections shall be stated in\n\n       lieu of an answer.\u201d); T.R. 33(C) (requiring responding party to serve \u201canswers\n\n       or objections within a period designated by the party submitting the\n\n       interrogatories, not less than thirty [30] days after service\u201d); T.R. 34(B)\n\n       (requiring written response to requests for production of documents, including\n\n       objections, within \u201ca period designated in the request, not less than thirty [30]\n\n       days after the service thereof\u201d); T.R. 36 (deeming admitted any request for\n\n       admission not answered or objected to \u201cwithin a period designated in the\n\n       request, not less than thirty [30] days after service thereof\u201d). The deadlines for\n\n       discovery responses, including objections, in those rules should be applied in\n\n       this case.\n\n\n[32]   Here, AMW served its amended objections after the 30-day deadline set in the\n\n       relevant trial rules, beyond any extension granted in a trial court order or\n\n       allowed by Town, and more than 30 days after the Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       denied transfer of the interlocutory appeal. As a result, I believe the objections\n\n       AMW asserted in its June 2021 first supplemental responses were not timely.\n\n\n[33]   Finally, although I would find AMW\u2019s new objections to be untimely, I do not\n\n       believe that AMW has waived those objections or that Marshall v. Woodruff\n\n       requires a contrary conclusion. Marshall responded to a motion to compel\n\n       discovery on the ground that the requested information was \u201cunavailable.\u201d\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 18 of 20\n\f       Marshall v.

App. 1987),\n\n       which held that a party may not raise in a motion to correct error or on appeal\n\n       an issue not raised in the trial court. In sum, Marshall tells us that an untimely\n\n       objection is waived when it is asserted for the first time in a motion to correct\n\n       error or later.\n\n\n[34]   Here, as the majority explains, AMW\u2019s objections were raised prior to the\n\n       hearing on the Motion to Compel; in other words, much sooner than at the\n\n       motion-to-correct-error stage. This begs the question, when does a late-raised\n\n       objection become waived. I would suggest the following factors are relevant to\n\n       that inquiry. To determine whether an untimely objection to a discovery\n\n       request is waived, I believe courts should consider factors such as these:\n\n\n               1. the obstreperousness of the party;\n\n\n               2. the complexity (or lack thereof) of the issues;\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024       Page 19 of 20\n\f               3. the amount of time that passed between a motion to compel\n               and the hearing on that motion;\n\n\n               4. the amount of time, effort, and/or expense the requesting\n               party put into trying to get the issue resolved (e.g., T.R. 26(F)\n               efforts); and\n\n\n               5. good cause.\n\n\n[35]   Applying such an analysis to this case, I believe that AMW\u2019s supplemental\n\n       responses (the late-raised objections) were late for the reasons explained above,\n\n       but I would hold that those objections are not waived given: (1) the rare and\n\n       unusual circumstances of this case, namely, the confusion created by the\n\n       interlocutory appeal as to whether the trial court retained authority over the\n\n       matter; (2) the lack of evidence that either party was being obstreperous; (3) the\n\n       lack of any real effort by Town to resolve the issue, given that Town only sent a\n\n       single letter to AMW pursuant to T.R. 26(F); (4) the fact that Town\u2019s Motion\n\n       to Compel was filed on August 28, 2020, and the hearing on that motion did\n\n       not occur until July 9, 2021; and (5) the fact that the amended/supplemented\n\n       objections were filed prior to the hearing on the motion to compel.\n\n\n[36]   For these reasons, I concur and would also reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 23A-PL-508 | January 19, 2024         Page 20 of 20\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1981654/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2107967/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2192069/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2243528/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2724476/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2851053/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925387/", "id": 9925387, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467549/edgerock-development-llc-v-c-h-garmong-son-inc/", "cluster_id": 9467549, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467549/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T09:03:30.212306-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T09:05:46.907965-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "c9010fa4c2e051c9482bd0f8832849b63be6e571", "page_count": 56, "download_url": "https://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=9ddcPcwdk2u9AeQJFJgjpurXHw-K_B_deE9ebN2FuQgeNR5YFbZVOanmZ4kLmEbJ0", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/19/edgerock_development_llc_v._c._h._garmong__son_inc.pdf", "plain_text": "                                                                                   FILED\n                                                                               Jan 19 2024, 8:53 am\n\n                                                                                   CLERK\n                                                                               Indiana Supreme Court\n                                                                                  Court of Appeals\n                                                                                    and Tax Court\n\n\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT                                    ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEES C.H.\nEDGEROCK DEVELOPMENT, LLC                                  GARMONG & SON, INC., AND\nMaggie L.

Garmong &\n\n      Son, Inc. (\u201cGarmong\u201d), Fox Contractors Corp. (\u201cFox\u201d), and Signworks\n\n      (\u201cSignworks\u201d) to complete the \u201cTrails of Westfield\u201d (the \u201cProject\u201d), a\n\n      commercial building project along State Road 32 in the City of Westfield (the\n\n      \u201cCity\u201d). The Project included work that was to be completed on five different\n\n      parcels of land, which were owned by three different entities. EdgeRock owned\n\n      two of the parcels, which were secured by a mortgage that had been executed in\n\n      favor of First Bank Richmond (\u201cFirst Bank\u201d). ZPS Westfield, LLC (\u201cZPS\u201d)\n\n      owned two of the parcels and contracted directly with EdgeRock for the work\n\n      that was to be completed on its land in connection with the Project and paid its\n\n      financial obligations outlined in its contract with EdgeRock in full.\n\n\n[2]   EdgeRock, however, failed to satisfy its financial obligations under its contracts\n\n      with Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, all three of which sought to encumber\n\n      certain parcels connected with the Project with mechanic\u2019s liens and filed\n\n      breach-of-contract actions against EdgeRock. After finding, inter alia, that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens filed in connection with the Project were valid and had priority\n\n      over a portion of First Bank\u2019s mortgage interest in EdgeRock\u2019s property, the\n\n      trial court entered judgment against EdgeRock and in rem judgments against\n\n      EdgeRock\u2019s and ZPS\u2019s property. The trial court also determined that\n\n      EdgeRock was entitled to recover certain road-impact fees (the \u201cRIF Funds\u201d)\n\n      that had been paid in connection to the Project by the City.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 3 of 56\n\f[3]   ZPS and EdgeRock challenge the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding the\n\n      validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens. ZPS also challenges the\n\n      inclusion of uninstalled material in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against its\n\n      property as well as the propriety of the prejudgment interest awarded to\n\n      Signworks. First Bank challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens had priority over part of its recorded mortgage interest.\n\n      EdgeRock challenges various summary judgment rulings made by the trial\n\n      court, and multiple parties challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that\n\n      EdgeRock is entitled to receive the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[4]   We conclude that (1) both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n      and EdgeRock\u2019s property are invalid; (2) the cost of uninstalled material should\n\n      not have been in included in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      and ZPS should not have been ordered to pay prejudgment interest to\n\n      Signworks; (3) to the extent that priority questions remain, First Bank\u2019s\n\n      mortgage interest, in its entirety, has priority; (4) the trial court did not err in\n\n      making the challenged summary judgment rulings; and (5) distribution of the\n\n      RIF Funds is stayed pending a ruling by the Hamilton Commercial Court in a\n\n      related matter regarding the priority of the secured interests in the funds and\n\n      any future ruling from this court regarding the RIF Funds should be consistent\n\n      with that of the Hamilton Commercial Court. We further conclude that the\n\n      trial court erred in denying First Bank\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees but that no\n\n      party is entitled to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, we note\n\n      that EdgeRock has not challenged the judgments against it relating to the\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024          Page 4 of 56\n\f      breach-of-contract claims brought by Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, and our\n\n      conclusions relating to the validity of the mechanic\u2019s liens do not alter those\n\n      judgments against EdgeRock in any way. Pursuant to our above-stated\n\n      conclusions, we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse\n\n      in part, and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n      I.      Initiation of the Project\n[5]   In 2015, EdgeRock and its investors purchased numerous separate parcels of\n\n      undeveloped land totaling seventeen acres along State Road 32 in the City.

The five lots were then zoned as follows:\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 5 of 56\n\f            \u2022    Lot 1 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a\n                 Starbucks);\n            \u2022    Lot 2 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Penn\n                 Station and Forum Credit Union);\n            \u2022    Lot 3 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Crew\n                 Carwash);\n            \u2022    Lot 4 was zoned for multi-family apartments; and\n            \u2022    Lot 5 was zoned for retail business.\n\n      EdgeRock sold Lots 1 and 2 to ZPS in 2017, and, at some point, sold Lot 3 to\n\n      Dahm No. 49, LLC (\u201cDahm\u201d).1 EdgeRock maintained ownership of Lots 4\n\n      and 5.\n\n\n[6]   After purchasing Lots 1 and 2, ZPS contracted with EdgeRock to build two\n\n      structures and install related infrastructure on its property. ZPS\u2019s development\n\n      agreement for the construction and infrastructure on its property called for ZPS\n\n      to pay EdgeRock a total of $1,720,000.00. It is undisputed that ZPS paid the\n\n      entire amount it owed to EdgeRock, making its final payment in August of\n\n      2018.\n\n\n[7]   EdgeRock then contracted with Garmong to perform not only the work on\n\n      ZPS\u2019s property, but also work on the properties owned by EdgeRock and\n\n      Dahm. The total EdgeRock-Garmong contract amount was $3,253,390.00.\n\n      The EdgeRock-Garmong contract broke down the cost of Garmong\u2019s work into\n\n      two categories: \u201cLots 1 & 2\u201d totaling $1,172,114.00 and \u201cInfrastructure\u201d\n\n      totaling $1,730,284.00. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. The contract also\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Dahm was not a party to the underlying litigation and does not participate in this appeal.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 6 of 56\n\f      included $110,000.00 in contingency funds and an eight percent management\n\n      fee ($240,992.00) payable to Garmong. Garmong later submitted several\n\n      change orders, including Change Order 3 in the amount of $434,528.00, which\n\n      included work on Lot 3. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n      contract. Fox had a subcontract with Garmong, which included work on all\n\n      five lots.\n\n\n[8]   As part of the Project, the City contracted with EdgeRock to build 175th Street\n\n      (which would run to the north of Lots 4 and 5 and to the south of Lots 1, 2, and\n\n      3) and install related infrastructure (the \u201c175th-Street Project\u201d). The 175th-\n\n      Street Project was to be funded, at least in part, by RIF Funds issued by the\n\n      City. The 175th-Street Project included \u201c17.6 acres,\u201d with ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      making up 10.2% of the total acreage of the project and EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n      making up 58.6% of the total acreage. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 9 p. 36. The\n\n      remaining acreage came from Dahm\u2019s property. EdgeRock contracted directly\n\n      with Fox to complete the 175th-Street Project, which included building 175th\n\n      Street and installing related infrastructure. The EdgeRock-Fox contract was for\n\n      a total of $1,831,008.25. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Fox contract.\n\n      Its sole involvement was quitclaiming certain land needed to construct 175th\n\n      Street to the City.\n\n\n[9]   In September of 2018, EdgeRock contracted with Signworks to install two signs\n\n      on ZPS\u2019s property for a total price of $115,521.33. ZPS was not a party to the\n\n      EdgeRock-Signworks contract.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 7 of 56\n\f       II. Issues with Payment/Garmong\u2019s First Mechanic\u2019s\n           Lien\n[10]   As the Project moved forward, EdgeRock\u2019s payments to Garmong became\n\n       somewhat sporadic. EdgeRock paid invoices that had been submitted by\n\n       Garmong on December 11, 2017, April 17, 2018, and June 1, 2018. EdgeRock\n\n       did not pay invoices that were submitted by Garmong on March 7, 2018, June\n\n       20, 2018, July 30, 2018, August 24, 2018, September 25, 2018, and October 30,\n\n       2018. On December 4, 2018, following five months of nonpayment from\n\n       EdgeRock, Garmong filed a notice of intention to hold a mechanic\u2019s lien, and\n\n       recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $2,140,722.51. The lien was\n\n       recorded on December 5, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Garmong Lien\u201d).\n\n\n       III. First Bank Mortgage\n[11]   During late 2018 or early 2019, EdgeRock sought financing from First Bank \u201cto\n\n       refinance the existing mortgages\u201d on the planned development \u201cand pay for the\n\n       construction work\u201d that had thus far been completed. Ultimately, EdgeRock\n\n       received a $4,900,000.00 commercial loan from First Bank \u201cto reimburse for\n\n       land development expense[s] and payoff existing mortgages on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d\n\n       Ex. Vol. 19 p. 125. In return, First Bank received a mortgage interest on Lots 4\n\n       and 5 (the \u201cFirst Bank Mortgage\u201d); an assignment of EdgeRock\u2019s interests in an\n\n       agreement with Citizens Wastewater of Westfield, LLC; a secured interest in\n\n       the RIF Funds; and guaranty from EdgeRock\u2019s executives, Austin Dalton and\n\n       R. Birch Dalton. First Bank\u2019s loan documents included: (1) a UCC financing\n\n       statement signed by EdgeRock, granting the Bank a security interest in the RIF\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 8 of 56\n\f       Funds; (2) a Security Agreement executed by EdgeRock, granting First Bank a\n\n       security interest in the RIF Funds; and (3) a UCC financing statement filed with\n\n       the Indiana Secretary of State, covering collateral including the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[12]   The First Bank Mortgage was duly recorded on February 25, 2019. It is\n\n       undisputed that proceeds from the loan were distributed as follows:\n\n\n                 Amount                 Purpose\n                 $2,140,722.51          Payment to secure release of the 2018 Garmong\n                                        Lien\n                 $250,000.00            Payment of Blocked Interest Account Funds (used\n                                        for payment of loan interest)\n                 $45,431.00             Payment of loan origination fee\n                 $3500.00               Payment of appraisal fee\n                 $1000.00               Payment of appraisal review fee\n                 $46.00                 Payment of fee for flood determination\n                 $23.00                 Payment of wire and UCC filing fees\n                 $9269.00               Payment of various title company charges\n                 $165.00                Payment of recording charges\n                 $2,028,443.62          Payment to Acquisition Lenders to secure release\n                                        of the Acquisition Mortgage\n                 $15,000.00             Payment of EdgeRock\u2019s legal fees\n                 $5000.00               Payment of insurance premium\n                 $401,399.87            Payment to EdgeRock\n\n\n       The amounts tendered to the Acquisition Lenders equaled the amounts\n\n       remaining due under their respective acquisition promissory notes and served to\n\n       secure release of the Acquisition Mortgage. Following Garmong\u2019s receipt of\n\n       the $2,140,722.51, the 2018 Garmong Lien was released.\n\n\n[13]   A condition of the First Bank Mortgage had been that First Bank would\n\n       \u201creceive a first priority mortgage on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d Tr. Vol. 6 p. 117. First\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 9 of 56\n\f       Bank had not been made aware prior to the closing of the First Bank Mortgage\n\n       that Garmong \u201chad an outstanding claim for work performed of over $1 million\n\n       in addition to the Garmong mechanic\u2019s lien of $2.1 million that was being paid\n\n       off at the closing.\u201d Tr. Vol. 6 p. 117.\n\n\n       IV. Continued Issues with Payment\n[14]   Garmong submitted an invoice to EdgeRock on November 19, 2018, in the\n\n       amount of $299,155.84. This invoice had not been included in the 2018\n\n       Garmong Lien because the due date for payment had not passed as of the date\n\n       that the lien had been recorded. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice. Garmong\n\n       submitted another invoice to EdgeRock in the amount of $643,886.80 on\n\n       January 23, 2019. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice.\n\n\n[15]   According to the terms of its subcontract with Garmong, Fox was to receive\n\n       $1,315,000.00. According to the terms of its direct contract with EdgeRock,\n\n       Fox was to receive $1,831,008.25. Fox was not paid in full for its work done\n\n       under either contract.\n\n\n[16]   Signworks submitted invoices to EdgeRock on November 29, 2018, January 28,\n\n       2019, and April 17, 2019. EdgeRock, however, did not make any payments to\n\n       Signworks outside of its initial $3000.00 deposit.\n\n\n       V.      The Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n[17]   On June 24, 2019, Signworks recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 1 in the\n\n       amount of $48,992.29 and a separate mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 2 in the\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 10 of 56\n\f       amount of $59,039.04. On August 30, 2019, Fox recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\u2014\n\n       each in the sum of $1,213,228.23\u2014against ZPS\u2019s Lots 1 and 2 and EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       Lots 4 and 5. On September 4, 2019, Garmong recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against Lots 4 and 5 in the amount of $1,009,055.62. The next day, Garmong\n\n       recorded mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1 and 2 in the same amount. On\n\n       September 10, 2019, Fox recorded additional mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1, 2,\n\n       4, and 5, each in the amount of $500,053.43. Litigation under cause number\n\n       29D05-1912-PL-11500 (\u201cCause No. PL-11500\u201d) soon followed.\n\n\n       VI. Lien Foreclosure Proceedings\n[18]   On December 9, 2019, Garmong filed suit under Cause No. PL-11500 against\n\n       EdgeRock, ZPS, First Bank, Fox, and Signworks, seeking to foreclose its\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and\n\n       damages. On March 4, 2020, Fox filed cross-claims against EdgeRock and\n\n       ZPS, seeking to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract,\n\n       unjust enrichment, and violation of personal liability notice. On March 10,\n\n       2020, Fox filed a third-party complaint against the City in which it indicated\n\n       that it had named the City \u201cas a party to assert any interest it may have in the\n\n       Edge[R]ock Property and/or ZPS property.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 3 pp.\n\n       152, 153. On May 29, 2020, Garmong requested leave to amend its complaint\n\n       to dismiss its claims against Signworks and to add Signworks as a plaintiff to its\n\n       complaint. The trial court granted Garmong\u2019s motion and Garmong filed an\n\n       amended complaint listing Signworks as a plaintiff rather than a defendant.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 11 of 56\n\f       Counterclaims were subsequently filed against Garmong by EdgeRock and\n\n       Fox. The trial court scheduled trial starting on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n       VII. The RIF Funds\n[19]   On February 19, 2021, the City filed a motion for interpleader, in which it\n\n       sought \u201can order requiring the deposit of funds with the Court, declaring that\n\n       [the City] has satisfied its obligation under the [RIF] Credit Agreement, and\n\n       that its property is not encumbered by any parties to this matter, and ordering\n\n       its dismissal with prejudice.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 12. The City\n\n       claimed that it \u201cis in no position to determine how much should be disbursed to\n\n       each party that completed work on 175th.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 15.\n\n       Fox responded claiming that it \u201cis the only party in this lawsuit which\n\n       performed any work and supplied any materials for the construction of 175th\n\n       Street and the relocation of the Anna Kendall Drain [(the \u201cDrain\u201d)]. Fox is\n\n       entitled to all of the funds that will be interpleaded by [the City].\u201d Appellants\u2019\n\n       Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 28. First Bank also claimed to be entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n       While ZPS did not assert a formal claim for the RIF Funds in Cause No. PL-\n\n       11500, it asserted a priority interest in the RIF Funds in a separately filed\n\n       lawsuit in the Hamilton Commercial Court, under cause number 29D02-2107-\n\n       PL-5088 (\u201cCause No. PL-5088\u201d). This lawsuit, which was filed on July 20,\n\n       2021, remains pending.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The proceedings in the commercial court action were stayed by order of the court on June 21, 2022.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                            Page 12 of 56\n\f       VIII.            Competing Motions for Partial Summary\n                        Judgment\n[20]   On May 7, 2020, EdgeRock filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On\n\n       December 7, 2020, ZPS filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Ten days\n\n       later, the trial court issued an order holding all motions for summary judgment\n\n       in abeyance until trial began on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n[21]   On January 28, 2021, following the first two days of trial, the trial court issued\n\n       an order informing the parties that it would \u201cconsider summary judgment\n\n       motions prior to the next hearing date on April 9, 2021.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 16 p. 77. The trial court further ordered that\n\n\n               The parties are given until February 12, 2021[,] to file any new or\n               amended motions for summary judgment. The parties shall be\n               given until March 15, 2021[,] to file any responses to summary\n               judgment motions. A hearing will be set for the Court to hear\n               arguments on all summary judgment motions on March 24,\n               2021[.]\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 77. Signworks, Fox, and Garmong moved for\n\n       partial summary judgment on February 12, 2021. Also on February 12, 2021,\n\n       ZPS and EdgeRock filed amended motions for partial summary judgment.\n\n\n       IX. The Trial Court\u2019s Orders\n[22]   On April 7, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Garmong\u2019s motion for\n\n       partial summary judgment and denying EdgeRock\u2019s motion for partial\n\n       summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that Garmong\u2019s\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 13 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid and that summary\n\n       judgment relating to Change Order 3 was improper because a material dispute\n\n       remained as to whether Change Order 3 had been approved by EdgeRock. The\n\n       trial court further found that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the\n\n       Drain were never part of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract; the consequential\n\n       damages waiver barred EdgeRock\u2019s claim for rent abatement, loss of future\n\n       business, and tortious interference with banking relationships; EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       tortious interference claims are barred by the waiver; and rent abatement paid\n\n       to ZPS is barred by the waiver.\n\n\n[23]   On April 28, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying\n\n       in part ZPS\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial\n\n       court found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on the unjust\n\n       enrichment claims brought by Garmong and Signworks. The trial court found\n\n       that summary judgment relating to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens filed against ZPS\u2019s property was improper because issues of\n\n       material fact remained as to whether the liens were valid, specifically whether\n\n       the liens were overstated. In denying summary judgment on the question of\n\n       whether the mechanic\u2019s liens were valid, the trial court found, as a matter of\n\n       law, that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien had been timely filed. The trial court further\n\n       found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on Garmong\u2019s, Signworks\u2019s,\n\n       and Fox\u2019s requests for attorney\u2019s fees, stating that it is undisputed that ZPS had\n\n       paid EdgeRock \u201call that it was obligated to pay under the terms of the\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 14 of 56\n\f       Development Agreement,\u201d and, as a result, \u201cGarmong, Signworks, and Fox\n\n       may not recover attorney\u2019s fees\u201d from ZPS. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 83.\n\n\n[24]   On May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying in\n\n       part Fox\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court\n\n       found, as a matter of law, that Fox\u2019s liens on EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid,\n\n       but found that issues of material fact existed as to the validity of Fox\u2019s liens on\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[25]   Also on May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Signworks\u2019s\n\n       motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that\n\n       Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s property were \u201cvalid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 100.\n\n\n[26]   Trial continued on all remaining issues. After the conclusion of trial, on May\n\n       25, 2022, the trial court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\n\n       judgment. With respect to Garmong\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the\n\n       trial court concluded as follows: (1) EdgeRock had breached its contract with\n\n       Garmong; (2) Garmong was entitled to foreclose its liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property; (3) Garmong\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property were valid and were not\n\n       overstated; (4) Garmong had not breached its contract with EdgeRock; (5) there\n\n       was no basis for EdgeRock\u2019s slander-of-title or fraud claims; and (6) there was\n\n       no basis for ZPS\u2019s slander-of-title claims.\n\n\n[27]   With respect to Fox\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the trial court\n\n       concluded that EdgeRock had breached its contract with Fox. The trial court\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 15 of 56\n\f       further concluded that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against both EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n       and ZPS\u2019s property were valid and that Fox was entitled to foreclose its liens.\n\n\n[28]   With respect to Signworks\u2019s claims, the trial court concluded that EdgeRock\n\n       had breached its contract with Signworks. As a result of the breach, Signworks\n\n       was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from EdgeRock.\n\n\n[29]   With respect to questions relating to lien priority, the trial court concluded as\n\n       follows: (1) First Bank only had priority for the first $2,140,722.51 of its loan to\n\n       EdgeRock; (2) mechanic\u2019s liens take priority from the date the contractor begins\n\n       work; (3) equitable subrogation is not compatible with the Indiana Mechanic\u2019s\n\n       Lien Statute (the \u201cIMLS\u201d) and does not apply; (4) even if equitable subrogation\n\n       could apply, the equities favor Garmong and Fox; (5) First Bank\u2019s equitable\n\n       estoppel argument fails; (6) the \u201cspecific project\u201d language of Indiana Code\n\n       section 32-28-3-5(d) did not encompass First Bank\u2019s entire loan; and (7) First\n\n       Bank was entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[30]   Based on these conclusions, the trial court ordered the following:\n\n\n               1.

Thus, the purpose of mechanic\u2019s lien laws is to\n               prevent the inequity of a property owner enjoying the benefits of\n               the labor and materials furnished by others without recompense.\n\n\n       Premier Invs., 644 N.E.2d at 130 (internal citation omitted). Stated differently, a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien \u201cprevents landowners from enjoying their improved property\n\n       while those who provided the labor and materials get the shaft.\u201d U.S. Steel, 182\n\n       N.E.3d at 842.\n\n\n[33]   Indiana has long had a statutory right to a mechanic\u2019s lien.

The current version of the\n\n       IMLS provides that\n\n\n               A contractor, a subcontractor, a mechanic, a lessor leasing\n               construction and other equipment and tools, whether or not an\n               operator is also provided by the lessor, a journeyman, a laborer,\n               or any other person performing labor or furnishing materials or\n               machinery, including the leasing of equipment or tools, for:\n                     (1) the erection, alteration, repair, or removal of:\n                             (A) a house, mill, manufactory, or other\n                             building; or\n                             (B) a bridge, reservoir, system of\n                             waterworks, or other structure;\n                     (2) the construction, alteration, repair, or removal of\n                     a walk or sidewalk located on the land or bordering\n                     the land, a stile, a well, a drain, a drainage ditch, a\n                     sewer, or a cistern; or\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 20 of 56\n\f                    (3) any other earth moving operation;\n               may have a lien as set forth in this section.\n\n\n       Ind.

Code \u00a7 32-28-3-2(a). Generally,\n\n\n               a person who wishes to acquire a lien upon property, whether the\n               claim is due or not, must file in duplicate a sworn statement and\n               notice of the person\u2019s intention to hold a lien upon the property\n               for the amount of the claim:\n                      (1) in the recorder\u2019s office of the county; and\n                      (2) not later than ninety (90) days after performing\n                      labor or furnishing materials or machinery[.]\n\n\n       Ind.

Applicable Standards of Review\n       A.      Summary Judgment\n[37]   When reviewing a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying summary judgment,\n\n       \u201cour standard of review is the same as that of the trial court.\u201d Webb v. City of\n\n       Carmel, 101 N.E.3d 850, 860 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018).\n\n\n               We stand in the shoes of the trial court and apply a de novo\n               standard of review. Our review of a summary judgment motion\n               is limited to those materials designated to the trial court.\n               Summary judgment is appropriate only where the designated\n               evidence shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and\n               the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For\n               summary judgment purposes, a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it bears on\n               the ultimate resolution of relevant issues. We view the pleadings\n               and designated materials in the light most favorable to the non-\n               moving party. Additionally, all facts and reasonable inferences\n               from those facts are construed in favor of the non-moving party.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 22 of 56\n\f       Id. (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe initial burden is on the summary-\n\n       judgment movant to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of fact as to\n\n       a determinative issue, at which point the burden shifts to the non-movant to\n\n       come forward with contrary evidence showing an issue for the trier of fact.\u201d\n\n       Hughley v. State, 15 N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014) (cleaned up).\n\n\n       B.      Findings & Conclusions\n[38]   In cases where the trial court enters findings of fact and conclusions thereon,\n\n       our standard of review is two-tiered:\n\n\n               [W]e first determine whether the evidence supports the trial\n               court\u2019s findings and second, we determine whether the findings\n               support the judgment. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous\n               when the record lacks any reasonable inference from the\n               evidence to support them and the trial court\u2019s judgment is clearly\n               erroneous if it is unsupported by the findings and the conclusions\n               which rely upon those findings. In determining whether the\n               findings on the judgment are clearly erroneous, we consider only\n               the evidence favorable to the judgment and all reasonable\n               inferences to be drawn therefrom.\n\n               In conducting our review, we cannot reweigh the evidence or\n               judge the credibility of any witnesses, and must affirm the trial\n               court\u2019s decision if the record contains any supporting evidence or\n               inferences. However, while we defer substantially to findings of\n               fact, we do not do so to conclusions of law. We evaluate\n               questions of law de novo and owe no deference to a trial court\u2019s\n               determination of such questions.\n\n\n       Roberts v. Feitz, 933 N.E.2d 466, 475\u201376 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citations\n\n       omitted, emphasis in original).\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 23 of 56\n\f       C.      Motion to Correct Error\n[39]   We review an order granting or denying a motion to correct error for abuse of\n\n       discretion. In re Paternity of V.A., 10 N.E.3d 65, 67 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014). \u201cAn\n\n       abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court\u2019s decision is against the logic and\n\n       effect of the facts and circumstances before the court, or the reasonable\n\n       inferences [drawn] therefrom.\u201d Id.\n\n\n       III. Analysis\n       A.      Validity/Scope of Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n[40]   Both ZPS and EdgeRock challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that\n\n       Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens were valid. In addition, ZPS contends\n\n       that the trial court erred by allowing Signworks to include costs for materials\n\n       that were never installed on its property in their mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property.\n\n\n[41]   1.      Breadth and Scope of Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n\n[42]   In 1896, the Indiana Supreme Court held that\n\n\n               [w]here labor is performed or materials furnished under one\n               contract upon several buildings, all situate[d] upon one lot of land\n               belonging to the contracting owner, the lien attaches to all the land\n               for the whole value of the labor performed, and it is immaterial\n               whether the contract specifies one sum for all work or separate\n               amounts for each building.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024            Page 24 of 56\n\f       Premier Steel Co. v. McElwaine-Richards Co., 144 Ind. 614, 619, 43 N.E. 876, 877\u2013\n\n       78 (1896) (emphasis added, internal quotation omitted). The Supreme Court\n\n       went on to say, however, that \u201c[i]f the work be done or materials are furnished\n\n       upon distinct premises, the lien must be against each of the several premises, according\n\n       to the value of the work and materials incorporated in each, and not against both for\n\n       the aggregate amount.\u201d Id. at 620, 43 N.E. at 878 (emphasis added). More\n\n       recently, we have stated that\n\n\n               unless, a joint lien is appropriate because work was done on, or\n               materials were supplied for, more than one structure on a single\n               tract of land, pursuant to one contract, a lien may not be had on\n               one structure for work done on or materials furnished for a\n               different structure.\n\n\n       Cato v. David Excavating Co., 435 N.E.2d 597, 605 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982), overruled\n\n       on other grounds by Johnson v. Blankenship, 688 N.E.2d 1250 (Ind. 1997) (internal\n\n       citations omitted).\n\n\n[43]   The question before us is, when work is completed on multiple parcels of land,\n\n       whether a mechanic\u2019s lien can encompass all costs associated with the project\n\n       as a whole or must be restricted in some fashion as it relates to the encumbered\n\n       parcel. Indiana Code section 32-28-3-1(b)(2) states that\n\n\n               A person \u2026 may have a lien separately or jointly \u2026 on the\n               interest of the owner of the lot or parcel of land:\n                      (A) on which the structure or improvement stands; or\n                      (B) with which the structure or improvement is\n                      connected;\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 25 of 56\n\f               to the extent of the value of any labor done or the material\n               furnished, or both, including any use of the leased equipment and\n               tools.\n\n\n       (Emphasis added). The parties dispute the meaning of the term \u201cconnected\u201d\n\n       with Garmong and Fox requesting that we define the term \u201cconnected\u201d broadly\n\n       and ZPS and EdgeRock requesting that we apply a narrower definition of the\n\n       term, i.e., a definition that would require common ownership of the land in\n\n       question.\n\n\n[44]   In support of its request for a broad interpretation of the term \u201cconnected,\u201d\n\n       Garmong points to this court\u2019s decision in West v. Dreher, 73 Ind. App. 133, 136,\n\n       126 N.E. 688, 689 (1920), in which we concluded that a mechanic\u2019s lien applied\n\n       equally to homes built on two adjoining parcels under one contract because\n\n       \u201cthe two houses, within the mechanic\u2019s-lien law of this State, are one piece of\n\n       work.\u201d However, our decision in West does not support an interpretation as\n\n       broad as that requested by Garmong because in West, the two parcels were\n\n       owned by the same individual, 73 Ind. App. at 134, 126 N.E. at 688, and we\n\n       cannot say that our conclusion would have been the same if the lots had been\n\n       owned by different individuals. Garmong also points to our decision in\n\n       Windfall Natural Gas, Mining & Oil Co. v. Roe, 42 Ind. App. 278, 85 N.E. 722\n\n       (1908), overruled on other grounds by Cline v. Indianapolis Mortar & Fuel Co., 65 Ind.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 26 of 56\n\f       App. 383, 117 N.E. 509 (1917), another case involving common ownership.3\n\n       For its part, Fox cites to our decision in Inter-City Contractors Services, Inc. v.\n\n       Consumer Building Industries, Inc., 175 Ind. App. 665, 373 N.E.2d 903 (1978), for\n\n       the proposition that a mechanic\u2019s lien could be asserted against numerous lots\n\n       for collective work completed under a single contract. However, Inter-City also\n\n       does not support the broad interpretation of the term \u201cconnected\u201d favored by\n\n       Fox and Garmong as it dealt with a single parcel owned by a single entity that\n\n       was subsequently divided into numerous lots. Id. at 667\u201368, 373 N.E.2d at\n\n       905.4\n\n\n[45]   For their part, ZPS and EdgeRock assert that the cases cited by Garmong and\n\n       Fox actually support their position, i.e., that applicable Indiana authority\n\n       applies a narrower interpretation of the term \u201cconnected\u201d as it requires\n\n       common ownership. Based on our reading of the relevant Indiana authority,\n\n       we must agree. See, e.g., Windfall, 42 Ind. App. at 280, 85 N.E. at 723\n\n       (providing that a joint lien may be had upon work completed under a single\n\n       contract when the parcels are connected in construction and ownership). This\n\n       interpretation is consistent with our decision in O.J. Shoemaker, Inc. v. Board of\n\n       Trustees of General Retirement System of City of Detroit, 479 N.E.2d 1349, 1351\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         While Garmong does not cite to any Indiana authority that would support the broad interpretation it is\n       requesting, it does cite Deegan v. Kilpatrick, 66 N.Y.S. 628 (1900) and Caird Engineering Works v. Seven-Up Gold\n       Mining Co., 111 P.2d 267 (Mont. 1940). However, to the extent that Deegan and Caird can be read as\n       supporting Garmong\u2019s position, we are not bound by either case.\n       4\n         Fox also cites to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Phillips v. Gilbert, 101 U.S. 721 (1879), but\n       that case also appears to involve common ownership of all of the land at issue.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                               Page 27 of 56\n\f       (Ind. Ct. App. 1985), in which we acknowledged that \u201ca lien may not be had on\n\n       one structure for work done on or materials furnished for a different\n\n       structure[.]\u201d5 We interpret relevant Indiana authority as requiring common\n\n       ownership before a mechanic\u2019s lien can be levied against a parcel for work that\n\n       has been completed on numerous parcels. Applying this interpretation to the\n\n       facts of this case, we turn our attention to the question of whether the trial court\n\n       erred in determining that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property and EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n       i.       Arguments Relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s Liens on ZPS\u2019s Property\n\n[46]   ZPS argues that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s finding that ZPS must pay, as part of a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien, for work performed on property ZPS does not own is\n\n       unprecedented and inconsistent with Indiana law.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p.\n\n       29. ZPS succinctly states, \u201cIndiana law doesn\u2019t allow a contractor to lien one\n\n       property for work performed on another without common ownership.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Reply Br. p. 12. ZPS points out that despite having been given the opportunity\n\n       to do so, neither Fox nor Garmong was able to prove the value of the work\n\n       actually performed on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In support of this interpretation, ZPS additionally cites to New England Savings Bank v. Meadow Lakes Realty\n       Co., 688 A.2d 345, 348\u201349 (Conn. App. Ct. 1997), in which the Appellate Court of Connecticut held that a\n       mechanic\u2019s lien filed against a property could not include amounts relating to work done on a different parcel\n       that did not enjoy common ownership. While this case could be considered instructive in so far as its holding\n       seems to be consistent with relevant Indiana authority, like the out-of-state cases cited by Garmong, it is not\n       binding precedent.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 28 of 56\n\f       a.      Garmong\u2019s Lien\n\n[47]   ZPS claims that the evidence established that the amount of Garmong\u2019s lien\n\n       includes amounts for work performed on its property, EdgeRock\u2019s property,\n\n       and Dahm\u2019s property. Garmong\u2019s Regional Manager, Mitch Hannum, who\n\n       had been involved with calculating the amount of the lien, testified at trial as\n\n       follows:\n\n\n               Q:     And so the amount of the lien that Garmong recorded on\n               [ZPS\u2019s] property is exactly the same as the amount of the lien it\n               recorded on EdgeRock\u2019s property. Is that correct?\n               A:     Yes.\n               Q:     The two liens cover the same scope of work, right?\n               A:     Yeah, it was one project.\n               Q:     And they both include work that took place on Lots 1, 2,\n               3, 4, and 5, correct?\n               A:     That is correct.\n               Q:     So [ZPS] owns Lots 1 and 2, but the lien that Garmong\n               recorded on this property includes work that was done on Lots 3,\n               4, and 5.\n               A:     Yes.\n               ****\n               Q:     So at the time that Garmong executed the ZPS lien, it\n               knew that the amount it was claiming included work performed\n               on Lots 3, 4, and 5. Is that correct?\n               A:     We recorded liens for the entire project. So, yes, we knew\n               when we filed liens that work was done on all of the five parcels because\n               we performed work on all of the five parcels.\n               Q:     And the amount that you were claiming in ZPS\u2019s lien, you\n               knew at the time you executed the lien that it included amounts\n               that Garmong claimed it was owed for work on Lots 3, 4, and 5.\n               A:     Yes, I believe I just - I believe that\u2019s what I just said, yes.\n               Yes.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024           Page 29 of 56\n\f       Tr. Vol. III pp. 14\u201315 (emphases added). In addition, Michael Preyss,\n\n       Garmong\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, testified that he did not know \u201chow much\n\n       of this $1,009,055.62 that is set forth in the mechanic\u2019s lien on [ZPS\u2019s] property\n\n       relates to work performed on\u201d ZPS\u2019s property. Tr. Vol. III p. 224. Preyss\n\n       further admitted that he could not \u201csit here telling you that X dollars went to\n\n       this particular parcel of land and Y dollars went to this other particular parcel of\n\n       land.\u201d Tr. Vol. III p. 223.\n\n\n[48]   ZPS claims that Hannum\u2019s and Preyss\u2019s testimony \u201cunequivocally established\n\n       that the Garmong lien on ZPS\u2019s Property included work on property that ZPS\n\n       did not own.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 42. Further, although Garmong asserts\n\n       otherwise, review of the invoices referenced by Garmong\u2019s counsel indicates\n\n       that the invoices do not appear to have included only work that benefited ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property. In sum, ZPS argues that \u201cGarmong\u2019s executives were right:\n\n       Garmong\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s Property includes amounts for work performed on\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s Property and Dahm\u2019s Property. This is fatal to Garmon\u2019s lien\n\n       claim against ZPS\u2019s Property and the trial court\u2019s Judgment enforcing\n\n       Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s Property should be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. pp. 44\u201345. We must agree with ZPS. Based on the evidence\n\n       presented to the trial court, we conclude that Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was\n\n       overstated such that it included costs associated with work that had not been\n\n       completed on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[49]   In Abbey Villas Development Corp. v. Site Contractors, Inc., 716 N.E.2d 91, 100\u201301\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 1999), we noted that where a claimant has intentionally or\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 30 of 56\n\f       through culpable negligence overstated the amount due to him, such\n\n       overstatement will render his lien void, but mere mistake will not necessarily\n\n       render the whole lien void when it is clear that no fraud was intended and the\n\n       claimant had not misled the defendant to his prejudice. Garmong asserts that\n\n       to the extent that its mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s property was overstated,\n\n       such overstatement was not intentional or the result of culpable negligence. We\n\n       conclude, however, that the evidence demonstrates otherwise. Hannum\u2019s and\n\n       Preyss\u2019s testimony unequivocally established that the Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien included work on property that ZPS did not own, and that Garmong had\n\n       known as much when it had filed its lien. As such, we conclude that\n\n       Garmong\u2019s knowing overstatement rendered its mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property void.6 See Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301.\n\n\n       b.      Fox\u2019s Liens\n\n[50]   ZPS claims that the majority of Fox\u2019s work on the 175th-Street Project did \u201cnot\n\n       even touch Lots 1 and 2\u201d and \u201cit is undisputed that Fox\u2019s lien includes amounts\n\n       for work performed on property not owned by ZPS.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p.\n\n       32. ZPS points to the trial testimony of Fox employee Don Adamson, who\n\n       testified that he did \u201cnot know the value of the work that Fox performed on\n\n       Lots 1 and 2 related to the 175th Street project\u201d and that none of the line items\n\n       charged in relation to the street construction related exclusively to work\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        Because we conclude that Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s property is void, it follows that the\n       award of prejudgment interest that was awarded in conjunction with and as part of the lien is extinguished.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                            Page 31 of 56\n\f       completed on Lots 1 and 2. Tr. Vol. IV p. 241. Adamson admitted that he had\n\n       \u201cno idea how to put a value on\u201d the work Fox completed as it relates to ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property and that he \u201cwould have no way to know what the value of the work\n\n       is.\u201d Tr. Vol. IV pp. 242, 243. Given the lack of evidence relating to the value\n\n       of Fox\u2019s work on the 175th-Street Project on Lots 1 and 2, ZPS claims that Fox\n\n       knowingly overstated its mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[51]   The trial court appeared to acknowledge that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens may have\n\n       been overstated as it related to ZPS, finding that \u201ceven if they were [overstated],\n\n       they were not intentionally or negligently overstated.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 2 p. 156. ZPS asserts that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that the\n\n       overstatement was not intentional or negligent, given the evidence\n\n       demonstrating that Fox had known when it had asserted the lien that the lien\n\n       had included costs associated with work that was not done on ZPS\u2019s property,\n\n       its overstatement was intentional. ZPS also asserts that the prejudice in this\n\n       regard was self-evident. We agree with ZPS on both assertions.\n\n\n[52]   ZPS claims that Fox failed to prove that its mechanic\u2019s liens represented the\n\n       value of its work on ZPS\u2019s property, noting that it did not bear the burden of\n\n       disproving the value but rather that Fox had the burden to prove the value of its\n\n       work. ZPS points to the fact that a large portion of Fox\u2019s work was completed\n\n       on Lot 3, which ZPS asserts provided no value to its property. ZPS also claims\n\n       that it did not benefit from the installation of the water and sewer work as it\n\n       already had access to water and does not tie into the new sewer line, which\n\n       allows Lot 4 access to the sewer system. Thus, ZPS claims that \u201c[t]his water\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 32 of 56\n\f       line and sewer lateral work provided no benefit whatsoever, directly or\n\n       indirectly, to ZPS\u2019s property\u2014yet because Fox included it in its lien against\n\n       ZPS\u2019s Property, the trial court\u2019s judgment forces ZPS to pay for it.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 36.\n\n\n[53]   In arguing that it would be inequitable for it to bear the complete cost of the\n\n       175th-Street Project, ZPS points to the fact that its property constitutes only\n\n       10.2% of the property adjoining 175th Street. Fox seems to merely assert that\n\n       its work was common-infrastructure work that benefitted all five lots, including\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property. Again, Adamson testified that he had \u201cno way to know the\n\n       value of the work\u201d on ZPS\u2019s property but acknowledged that the work on 175th\n\n       Street had benefited property owned by EdgeRock and Dahm. Tr. Vol. IV p.\n\n       243. In sum, ZPS asserts that \u201cFox\u2019s inclusion of amounts in its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       liens that did not benefit ZPS, or for work which was not performed on ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Property and benefited multiple property owners, means it intentionally or\n\n       negligently overstated its liens and thus they are void.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 25.\n\n\n[54]   Similar to our conclusion relating to Garmong, we conclude that the evidence\n\n       demonstrates that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien included work on property that ZPS\n\n       did not own, and that Fox had known as much when it had filed the lien. As\n\n       such, we conclude that Fox\u2019s knowing overstatement rendered its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien against ZPS\u2019s property void. See Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 33 of 56\n\f       ii.     Arguments Relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s Liens on EdgeRock\u2019s Property\n\n[55]   At the summary-judgment stage, EdgeRock, Garmong, and Fox sought\n\n       determinations as to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against EdgeRock\u2019s property. On April 7, 2021, the trial court determined that\n\n       \u201cGarmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on Edge[R]ock\u2019s property is valid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 71. On May 13, 2021, the trial court\n\n       likewise determined that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens, which related to both its direct\n\n       contract with EdgeRock and the Garmong subcontract, were valid as a matter\n\n       of law. In finding both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens to be valid as a\n\n       matter of law, the trial court determined that the liens had been timely filed and\n\n       that neither Garmong nor Fox had overstated the amount of its lien. Following\n\n       trial, the trial court reaffirmed its earlier determination that Garmong\u2019s and\n\n       Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n[56]   EdgeRock argues that both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s liens should have been found\n\n       invalid as a matter of law because neither Garmong nor Fox limited their liens\n\n       to costs associated with work completed on EdgeRock\u2019s property but included\n\n       costs associated with work done on property owned by ZPS and Dahm.\n\n       EdgeRock asserts that as a result of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s failure to separate out\n\n       the costs associated with work done on each individual property owner\u2019s\n\n       property,\n\n\n               [t]here are now effectively $4.8 million dollars\u2019 worth of liens on\n               lots owned by different people/entities when it is undisputed that\n               the cumulative amount owed is only $1.2 million. And on top of\n               that, the lien on Lot 3 has been removed altogether so that the\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 34 of 56\n\f               only lot benefiting from the work done on Lot 3 is not even in the\n               mix anymore. It is inequitable to allow Fox to pursue only ZPS\n               and EdgeRock without deducting the real, tangible value\n               provided by their work to Lot 3.\n\n\n       EdgeRock\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 55.\n\n\n[57]   Garmong claims that EdgeRock\u2019s status as the developer for the Project\n\n       subjected it to liability for the entire contract amount. Garmong asserts that if\n\n       EdgeRock \u201cis allowed to avoid the liens, the result is anything but equitable\u201d\n\n       and EdgeRock \u201cshould not be permitted to subdivide Garmong\u2019s lien rights for\n\n       the project to avoid paying Garmong.\u201d Garmong\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 43. Fox\n\n       also claims that it would be inequitable for EdgeRock \u201cto receive the benefit\n\n       and value of Fox\u2019s infrastructure work without having Edge[R]ock pay for it.\u201d\n\n       Fox\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 55. While both Garmong and Fox could clearly have\n\n       received, and in fact did receive, money judgments against EdgeRock for the\n\n       unpaid amount due under the parties\u2019 contracts, it does not necessarily follow\n\n       that Garmong and Fox could assert mechanic\u2019s liens for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property against EdgeRock\u2019s property.\n\n\n[58]   The parties have not cited to any Indiana authority creating an exception to the\n\n       common-ownership requirement that would extend EdgeRock\u2019s liability such\n\n       that its property can be encumbered by money owed for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property by virtue of its status as the Project developer. We conclude\n\n       that the rationale for our conclusions relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 35 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property apply equally to the liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property. We further conclude, therefore, that the liens were overstated.\n\n\n[59]   The evidence set forth in the preceding section establishes that both Garmong\n\n       and Fox had known at the time they recorded their mechanic\u2019s liens that the\n\n       lien amounts included work that had been completed on all five parcels. Thus,\n\n       Garmong and Fox overstated their lien amounts when they recorded their\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property. Like their liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property, their knowing overstatement has rendered their liens void. See Abbey\n\n       Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301. This conclusion, however, has no effect on the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination that EdgeRock had breached its contracts with both\n\n       Garmong and Fox or the resulting breach-of-contract judgments entered against\n\n       EdgeRock.\n\n\n       iii.    Signworks\u2019s Lien\n\n       a.      Inclusion of Costs Relating to Non-Installed Materials\n[60]   ZPS also contends that the trial court erred in allowing Signworks to include\n\n       the cost of materials purchased\u2014but not installed on ZPS\u2019s property\u2014 in its\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens. ZPS cites to our opinion in Cho v. Purdue Research Foundation,\n\n       803 N.E.2d 1161, 1172 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), for the proposition that a\n\n       contractor \u201ccannot maintain a mechanic\u2019s lien for the value of the materials and\n\n       equipment purchased but not installed or delivered.\u201d See also Stanray Corp. v.\n\n       Horizon Const., Inc., 168 Ind. App. 164, 177, 342 N.E.2d 645, 653 (1976)\n\n       (providing that a lien can only include materials furnished to a property owner,\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 36 of 56\n\f       which means that the materials have both been ordered and delivered to the\n\n       property owner). ZPS reiterates that because \u201cthe whole point of the\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien remedy\u201d is to prevent unjust enrichment to an owner\u2019s\n\n       property, [Signworks] should not be able to recover the costs of the challenged\n\n       materials which \u201cdid not improve ZPS\u2019s Property.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 32.\n\n\n[61]   ZPS claims that Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien for $93,268.37 included\n\n\n               $27,500[.00] for what Signworks described as \u201cmaterials\n               presently stored.\u201d It is undisputed that Signworks did not\n               perform all of the work called for in the contract as, among other\n               things, it has yet to install cabinets and toppers. These materials\n               are still being stored in Signworks\u2019[s] warehouse, where they\n               remain crated and packed.\n\n\n       ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 50 (internal record citations omitted). ZPS asserts that\n\n       \u201c[p]er Cho, \u2026 the value of these cabinets and toppers should not have been\n\n       included in the Judgment; the principal amount of the judgment in favor of\n\n       Signworks should be reduced by $27,500[.00].\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 50.\n\n\n[62]   Signworks argues that it can recover for the materials in question, which it\n\n       asserts were custom-fabricated for the Project. In support, Signworks cites to\n\n       our opinion in Jackson v. J.A. Franklin & Son, 107 Ind. App. 38, 41\u201342, 23\n\n       N.E.2d 23, 25 (1939), in which we concluded that \u201c[i]t is not always necessary\n\n       to show that the material went into the building. Circumstances in a given case\n\n       may be such that the owner of the building is estopped from invoking the\n\n       general rule.\u201d (Emphasis in original as published in the Indiana Appellate\n\n       Court Reports). Signworks further cites to our decision in Foster Lumber Co. v.\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 37 of 56\n\f       Sigma Chi Chapter House of De Pauw Univ., 49 Ind. App. 528, 532, 97 N.E. 801,\n\n       802 (1912), in which we concluded that \u201c[t]he materialman is properly said to\n\n       have \u2018furnished\u2019 the materials when he had delivered or has them ready for\n\n       delivery at the place where he has agreed to deliver them under the contract.\u201d\n\n       (Internal quotation omitted). Signworks asserts that the only reason the\n\n       materials were not installed was because EdgeRock had breached their contract.\n\n       Thus, under the circumstances of this case, Signworks argues that it should be\n\n       able to recover for the uninstalled materials.\n\n\n[63]   We find our decisions in Cho and Stanray to be instructive on this question. In\n\n       these cases, we concluded that materials are \u201cfurnished\u201d when \u201cordered for and\n\n       delivered.\u201d Stanray, 168 Ind. App. at 177, 342 N.E.2d at 653 (emphasis added).\n\n       As such, we conclude that Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was overstated to the\n\n       extent that it included the $27,500.00 value of the uninstalled materials.\n\n       However, unlike the Garmong and Fox liens, we do not conclude that the\n\n       overstatement was made in a knowing or negligent fashion as there was a good-\n\n       faith dispute as to whether the costs could be included. As such, we conclude\n\n       that Signworks\u2019s overstatement did not render its mechanic\u2019s lien void. See\n\n       Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 100\u201301 (providing that mere mistake in\n\n       overstatement will not necessarily render a mechanic\u2019s lien void when it was\n\n       clear that there was no fraud intended). On remand, we therefore instruct the\n\n       trial court to reduce Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien to eliminate the cost of the\n\n       uninstalled materials.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 38 of 56\n\f       b.      Inclusion of Prejudgment Interest\n[64]   ZPS also contends that the trial court erred in including an award of\n\n       prejudgment interest in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.\n\n\n               When reviewing a decision regarding an award of prejudgment\n               interest, our standard of review is for an abuse of discretion,\n               focusing on the trial court\u2019s threshold determination as to\n               whether the facts satisfy the test for making such an award.\n               Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. v. S.E. Lab Group, Inc., 644 N.E.2d\n               615, 617 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994), trans. denied. The decision to\n               award prejudgment interest rests on a factual determination and\n               this court may only consider the evidence most favorable to the\n               judgment. Id.\n\n               We note that the crucial factor in determining whether damages\n               in the form of prejudgment interest are allowable is whether the\n               damages were ascertainable in accordance with fixed rules of\n               evidence and accepted standards of valuation. Id. at 618. An\n               award of prejudgment interest is proper only where a simple\n               mathematical computation is required. Brane v. Roth, 590 N.E.2d\n               587, 593 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992), trans. denied. Damages that are the\n               subject of a good faith dispute cannot allow for an award of prejudgment\n               interest. Id.\n\n\n       Bopp v. Brames, 713 N.E.2d 866, 872 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (emphasis added),\n\n       trans. denied.\n\n\n[65]   While the amount owed to Signworks under its contract with EdgeRock was\n\n       not in dispute, as it related to ZPS, ZPS and Signworks were engaged in a good-\n\n       faith dispute regarding the amount of damages that should be included in\n\n       Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien both below and on appeal. Again, \u201cdamages that\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024          Page 39 of 56\n\f       are the subject of a good faith dispute cannot allow for an award of\n\n       prejudgment interest.\u201d Id. As such, we conclude that the trial court abused its\n\n       discretion in including an award of prejudgment interest in Signworks\u2019s\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s property. See Clark v. Hunter, 861 N.E.2d 1202, 1208\n\n       (Ind. Ct. App. 2007) (providing that damages that are the subject of a good-faith\n\n       dispute cannot allow for an award of prejudgment interest nor is an award\n\n       proper when the trial court must exercise its judgment to assess the amount of\n\n       damages).7 On remand, we instruct the trial court to remove the award of\n\n       prejudgment interest from Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.\n\n\n       B.       Priority Questions\n[66]   Given our conclusion that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against\n\n       EdgeRock\u2019s property are invalid, there is no longer any question as to whether\n\n       the liens have priority over any portion of the First Bank Mortgage because the\n\n       liens no longer exist. Moreover, it is clear under Indiana law that the First\n\n       Bank Mortgage has priority over the subsequently-entered judgments entered\n\n       against EdgeRock in connection with Garmong\u2019s, Fox\u2019s, and Signworks\u2019s\n\n       breach-of-contract claims. See Huntingburg Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Griese, 456\n\n       N.E.2d 448, 452 (Ind. Ct. App. 1983) (\u201cA judgment lien is subordinate to all\n\n       prior conveyances and mortgages and all existing loans and equities in favor of\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         While the trial court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest as it relates to ZPS, we again\n       note that no similar good-faith dispute as to damages exists as it relates to Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract\n       action against EdgeRock. As such, the award of prejudgment interest that was awarded in relation to\n       Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract action against EdgeRock stands.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                              Page 40 of 56\n\f       third persons.\u201d). On remand, we therefore instruct the trial court to grant the\n\n       First Bank Mortgage priority over all remaining encumbrances on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property that are at issue in this case.\n\n\n       C.      Challenged Summary Judgment Rulings\n[67]   EdgeRock has challenged two of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings,\n\n       which, if found erroneous, could potentially affect the amount of Garmong\u2019s\n\n       breach-of-contract judgment against it.\n\n\n       1.      Change Order 3\n\n[68]   EdgeRock asserted below that it had not approved Change Order 3 and sought\n\n       summary judgment on the issue. In requesting summary judgment, EdgeRock\n\n       had claimed that \u201cGarmong could not recover amounts incurred pursuant to\n\n       Change Order #3 because EdgeRock never approved this Change Order in\n\n       writing as unambiguously required under the contract\u201d and had designated\n\n       supporting evidence. EdgeRock\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 63. For its part, Garmong\n\n       designated evidence indicating that EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 and had paid seventy-five percent of the amount due for Change Order\n\n       3 without complaint.\n\n\n[69]   The trial court denied EdgeRock\u2019s request for summary judgment, finding that\n\n       issues of fact precluded summary judgment. Specifically, the trial court found\n\n       that\n\n\n               Damian Etchison and Mitch Hannum both testified that\n               Edge[R]ock orally approved Change Order 3. This testimony\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 41 of 56\n\f         contradicts [EdgeRock\u2019s manager Birch] Dalton\u2019s testimony and\n         creates an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.\n         Edge[R]ock provided Garmong with the revised civil drawings\n         that were prepared by Edge[R]ock\u2019s own civil engineer and\n         asked Garmong to carry out the work depicted on those revised\n         civil drawings. If Garmong had not carried out Change Order 3,\n         construction on the Project could not have begun. All site\n         activity would have stopped after demolition.\n\n         Edge[R]ock also paid for seventy-five percent of Change Order 3.\n         When negotiating the $2.1 million payment for the release of the\n         November 2018 mechanic\u2019s lien, Edge[R]ock did not assert that\n         Change Order 3 was not approved. Edge[R]ock also claims in its\n         brief that the $2.1 million payment was a final payment, so\n         Edge[R]ock believes it has paid for the Change Order 3 work in\n         full.\n\n         Edge[R]ock paying for the Change Order 3 work gives rise to the\n         inference that Edge[R]ock approved Change Order 3. The Court\n         must construe all inferences that can be drawn from the\n         designated evidence in Garmong\u2019s favor. Hughley v. State, 15\n         N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014). A reasonable factfinder could\n         conclude from Edge[R]ock\u2019s payment of Change Order 3 that\n         Edge[R]ock approved the Change Order. Thus, there is an issue\n         of fact for trial.\n\n\nAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 66\u201367 (emphasis in original, internal record\n\ncitation omitted).8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Following trial, the trial court found that Change Order 3 was valid. EdgeRock does not appear to\nspecifically challenge the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions relating to Change Order 3 in its final order,\ninstead focusing its argument on its belief that it had been entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                                Page 42 of 56\n\f[70]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence created an issue of\n\n       material fact as to whether EdgeRock had approved Change Order 3. The\n\n       designated evidence established that EdgeRock had orally approved other\n\n       change orders and had paid for seventy-five percent of the charges related to\n\n       Change Order 3 without objection. Witness statements also provided\n\n       conflicting evidence as to whether EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 before the included work commenced. The Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       has recognized that a contract providing that any modification must be in\n\n       writing may nevertheless be modified orally. See AM General LLC v. Armour, 46\n\n       N.E.3d 436, 443 n.3 (Ind. 2015) (citing Sees v. Bank One, Ind., N.A., 839 N.E.2d\n\n       154, 161 (Ind. 2005)). Upon reviewing the parties\u2019 designated evidence, the\n\n       trial court determined that issues of material fact existed. Like the trial court,\n\n       we conclude that the designated evidence created an issue of material fact. As\n\n       such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to Change\n\n       Order 3.\n\n\n       2.      Scope-of-Work Question\n\n[71]   EdgeRock and Garmong filed competing motions for summary judgment on\n\n       the question of whether the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain\n\n       were included in the scope of work covered by the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n       contract. EdgeRock claimed below that this work was included in the parties\u2019\n\n       contract and, because Garmong did not complete this work and EdgeRock was\n\n       forced to contract with Fox to complete the work, EdgeRock was entitled to\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 43 of 56\n\f       credit for costs associated with this work that had been paid to Garmong. The\n\n       trial court found, as a matter of law, that\n\n\n               [t]he scope of work listed in the contract did not include the\n               [175th-Street Project] or the drain relocation. These items were\n               thus not removed from Garmong\u2019s scope of work as they were\n               never part of Garmong\u2019s scope of work to begin with.\n               Edge[R]ock is not entitled to a contractual credit for the [175th-\n               Street Project] or the drain relocation.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 64\u201365. EdgeRock argues on appeal that the trial\n\n       court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Garmong on this issue.\n\n\n[72]   The designated evidence demonstrated that the EdgeRock-Garmong contract\n\n       provided that the contract sum was guaranteed \u201cnot to exceed\u201d $3,255,390.00.\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 225. The scope of work included in the contract\n\n       was detailed in Exhibit B of the contract. Exhibit B outlined both the work that\n\n       was to be completed by Garmong and the budget for said work. The budget\n\n       breakdown provided as follows:\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 44 of 56\n\fAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. As the budget breakdown indicates,\n\n$1,300,277.00 was budgeted for work that was to be completed on Lots 1 and 2\n\nand $1,953,113.00 was budgeted for infrastructure work. EdgeRock asserts that\n\nthe infrastructure work included all work that was needed to complete the\n\n175th-Street Project and to relocate the Drain. While the budget sheet does\n\ninclude costs in the infrastructure portion for \u201cAsphalt Paving,\u201d which, in\n\ntheory, could have been part of the funds necessary to construct 175th Street,\n\nthe budget breakdown does not appear to include any costs that would appear\n\nto apply to drain relocation as \u201c$0\u201d was allocated to plumbing. Appellants\u2019 Jt.\n\nApp. Vol. 2 p. 240.\n\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 45 of 56\n\f[73]   In finding that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain were not\n\n       included in the scope of work of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract, the trial\n\n       court noted that adopting EdgeRock\u2019s interpretation of the included scope of\n\n       work would require it to violate the principles of contract interpretation and to\n\n       rewrite the parties\u2019 contract. Specifically, the trial court determined that\n\n\n               Adopting Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading would require the Court to strike\n               out the eight pages of the Guaranteed Maximum Price\n               Amendment listing the scope of work. That portion of the\n               Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment would serve no\n               purpose if the true scope of work was all the work depicted in the\n               drawings.\n\n               Garmong\u2019s reading of the contract by contrast harmonizes the\n               whole contract without eliminating any part of it. The only\n               reading that makes the document into a cohesive whole is that\n               the drawing log lists the source material for the narrower eight-\n               page scope of work to be undertaken by Garmong. Garmong\u2019s\n               reading is also consistent with the drawings themselves, which\n               depict a phased project. Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading of the contract\n               would eliminate the phased aspect of the Project as Garmong\n               would be carrying out all phases at once.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 64.\n\n\n[74]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence establishes as a\n\n       matter of law that the 175th-Street and Drain projects were not included in the\n\n       scope of work set forth in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract. In claiming that\n\n       these projects were included, or that a question of material fact existed as to\n\n       whether they were, EdgeRock points to the following pictures which it claims\n\n       prove that drain-relocation work was \u201cfoundational work that had to be\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 46 of 56\n\fcompleted at the beginning of the Project\u201d and thus must have been included in\n\nthe EdgeRock-Garmong contract:\n\n\n\n\nEdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 22 (noting that the original pictures could be found at\n\nEx. Vol. 19 pp. 4, 7 but that it had added the arrows and boxes). EdgeRock\n\nargues that these pictures, when considered together with the budget line item\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 47 of 56\n\f       including $1,179,997.00 for earth moving, with a separate amount included for\n\n       earth moving on Lots 1 and 2, \u201cprovide the plans for moving the stream and\n\n       drain as part of the base contract.\u201d EdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 23. We disagree.\n\n       Rather, we conclude that the pictures relied on by EdgeRock fall short both of\n\n       proving or creating an issue of material fact as to whether that drain-relocation\n\n       work was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract as they merely depict\n\n       where the original drain was and to where it was subsequently relocated but do\n\n       not address whether the cost was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract.\n\n       Because the designated evidence falls short of either proving EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       proffered interpretation or creating an issue of material fact on the question, we\n\n       further conclude that the award of summary judgment in favor of Garmong on\n\n       the scope-of-work question was appropriate.\n\n\n       D.      RIF Funds\n[75]   Noting First Bank\u2019s secured interest in the RIF Funds, the trial court initially\n\n       awarded the RIF Funds to First Bank. In doing so, the trial court rejected Fox\u2019s\n\n       claim to the RIF Funds. In its order on the parties\u2019 motions to correct error, the\n\n       trial court acknowledged that ZPS had filed suit against EdgeRock in Cause\n\n       No. PL-5088 and that that action was pending. The trial court amended its\n\n       prior order to award the RIF Funds to EdgeRock. EdgeRock claims that the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination is correct because pursuant to its contract with the\n\n       City, it is entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[76]   First Bank contends that the trial court\u2019s original order was correct with respect\n\n       to the RIF Funds because it holds a first-priority secured interest in the RIF\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 48 of 56\n\f       Funds. First Bank argues that the RIF Agreement was a contract between the\n\n       City and EdgeRock and that Fox has no claims to the RIF Funds under the\n\n       contract and that Fox\u2019s claim on the RIF Funds is not supported by law. First\n\n       Bank likewise argues that ZPS has no claim to the RIF Funds as it has failed to\n\n       offer any evidence in the instant case which supports ZPS\u2019s assertion that it has a\n\n       secured interest in the funds. Furthermore, to the extent that Fox and others\n\n       assert that First Bank is not entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not\n\n       asserted a judicial claim against the funds, First Bank argues that it was not\n\n       required to do so.\n\n\n[77]   Fox contends that it is entitled to the RIF Funds. In support of its claim, Fox\n\n       notes that it brought the City into the litigation and asserts that it was the only\n\n       party to incur any costs associated with or do any of the work on the 175th-\n\n       Street Project. Fox asserts that the use of impact fees, such as the RIF Funds,\n\n       are controlled by Indiana Code section 36-7-4-1300 et seq., which indicates that\n\n       such funds are to be used to mitigate costs directly in connection with projects\n\n       for the construction of infrastructure, such as roads, public ways, bridges,\n\n       drains, and drainage. See Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-7-4-1305, -1309. Fox claims that\n\n       because it built the 175th-Street Project but was never paid for its work, it is\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds. Fox argues that while other entities have claimed to\n\n       have a right to the RIF Funds, it was the only party to assert a formal claim for\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 49 of 56\n\f       the funds in the instant lawsuit.9 Fox also argues that EdgeRock was not\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not incurred any costs associated with\n\n       the 175th-Street Project. EdgeRock contests this argument, claiming that due to\n\n       the allegedly substandard quality of Fox\u2019s work, it had to hire another\n\n       contractor to finish the job. Fox does not have a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds.\n\n\n[78]   For its part, ZPS contends that it has a secured interest in the RIF Funds. It\n\n       asserts, however, that \u201c[g]iven the multiple interests in the RIF Funds, many of\n\n       which were not represented or addressed in this action, and given that\n\n       Edge[R]ock did not even assert a claim to the RIF Funds, the trial court\u2019s\n\n       award was erroneous and must be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 57. ZPS\n\n       asserts that as of May 24, 2021, EdgeRock owed ZPS $441,879.52 and that in\n\n       relation to this debt, ZPS had secured its interest in the RIF Funds. ZPS argues\n\n       that \u201c[e]ntitlement to the RIF Funds should be determined by the Hamilton\n\n       County Commercial Court, where all entitles with a secured interest in\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s assets are parties.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 49. Thus, ZPS claims that\n\n       we should \u201creverse the award of RIF Funds to Edge[R]ock and remand with\n\n       instructions to the Hamilton County Clerk to continue holding the RIF Funds\n\n       pending resolution of\u201d Cause No. PL-5088. ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 54.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n        Fox classifies First Bank\u2019s claimed interest in the RIF Funds as being a private debt obligation that was\n       unrelated to the construction of 175th Street.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 50 of 56\n\f[79]   Given that at least one party, i.e., First Bank, has a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding the RIF Funds to\n\n       EdgeRock. However, given the allegedly competing secured interests in the\n\n       funds, not all of which are represented in this action but all of which are\n\n       represented in Cause No. PL-5088, we instruct the trial court to stay\n\n       distribution of the funds in this case pending a determination of priority of the\n\n       competing secured interests by the Hamilton Commercial Court. Moreover,\n\n       any future rulings by the trial court regarding the RIF Funds should be\n\n       consistent with the priority determination made by the Hamilton Commercial\n\n       Court in Cause No. PL-5088.\n\n\n       E.

First Bank\u2019s Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n[80]   \u201cIndiana adheres to the American rule that in general, a party must pay his own\n\n       attorneys\u2019 fees absent an agreement between the parties, a statute, or other rule\n\n       to the contrary.\u201d R.L.

Id.\n\n\n[81]   First Bank requested that EdgeRock be ordered to pay its attorney\u2019s fees on\n\n       June 9, 2022. In its petition, First Bank asserted that pursuant to the terms of\n\n       the parties\u2019 mortgage and loan agreement, it is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees\n\n       from EdgeRock following a default. First Bank alleged that EdgeRock had\n\n       defaulted on the loan agreement \u201cas a result of, among other things,: a. after an\n\n       extension of the maturing date, the loan matured on November 19, 2020; and b.\n\n       the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens by Garmong and Fox, and the failure of\n\n       [EdgeRock] to pay those mechanic\u2019s liens and claims.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt.

EdgeRock does not appear to challenge First Bank\u2019s request for\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees. However, Garmong and Fox challenge First Bank\u2019s request for\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees, claiming that \u201cobtaining a judicial finding of default is a\n\n       precondition to obtaining a fee award\u201d and First Bank \u201cdid not ask the trial\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 52 of 56\n\f       court to find that [EdgeRock] defaulted on the note, and the trial court, thus,\n\n       did not make such a finding.\u201d Appellees Garmong & Fox\u2019s Jt.

Ex.\n\n       Vol. 19 p. 141. First Bank asserts that EdgeRock has defaulted in two ways,\n\n       neither of which any party appears to contest occurred. Given First Banks\u2019s\n\n       seemingly undisputed claim that EdgeRock has defaulted on the First Bank\n\n       Mortgage, we conclude that pursuant to the terms of the First Bank Mortgage,\n\n       First Bank adequately demonstrated that EdgeRock had defaulted on the\n\n       parties\u2019 agreement, and, as a result, is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the\n\n       express terms of the mortgage agreement.\n\n\n       2.      Requests for Appellate Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n[85]   Garmong, Fox, and Signworks each request an award of appellate attorney\u2019s\n\n       fees. The IMLS provides at Indiana Code section 32-28-3-14 that \u201ca plaintiff or\n\n       lienholder who recovers a judgment in any sum is entitled to recover reasonably\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d \u201cThe statute also encompasses attorney\u2019s fees associated with\n\n       appellate proceedings.\u201d Ambrose v.

Signworks\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 17. Signworks does not have a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien against EdgeRock\u2019s property and is therefore not entitled to an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees under the IMLS. Moreover, while Indiana\n\n       Appellate Rule 66(E) provides that this court may assess damages, including an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, if an appeal is frivolous or in bad faith, we\n\n       \u201cuse extreme restraint when exercising this power because of the potential\n\n       chilling effect upon the exercise of the right to appeal.\u201d Kelley v. Kelley, 158\n\n       N.E.3d 396, 400 (Ind. Ct. App. 2020). Given the complexity of the claims\n\n       presented on appeal, we cannot say that Signworks is entitled to an award of\n\n       appellate attorney\u2019s fees under Appellate Rule 66(E).\n\n\n\n       Conclusion\n[87]   In sum, we conclude as follows: (1) Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens are\n\n       invalid as to both ZPS\u2019s property and EdgeRock\u2019s property, (2) the trial court\n\n       erred in including the value of uninstalled materials in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien against ZPS\u2019s property and the trial court\u2019s in rem judgment against ZPS\n\n       should be reduced by that amount, (3) the trial court erred in ordering ZPS to\n\n       pay Signworks prejudgment interest, (4) the First Bank Mortgage has priority\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 55 of 56\n\f       over all remaining encumbrances on EdgeRock\u2019s property that are at issue in\n\n       the instant appeal, (5) the trial court did not err in denying EdgeRock\u2019s motion\n\n       for summary judgment with regard to Change Order 3 or in granting summary\n\n       judgment in favor of Garmong with regard to the scope-of-work question, (6)\n\n       distribution of the RIF Funds is stayed pending a ruling by the Hamilton\n\n       Commercial Court in Cause No. PL-5088 regarding priority of the secured\n\n       interests in the funds and any future ruling from this court regarding the RIF\n\n       Funds should be consistent with that of the Hamilton Commercial Court, (7)\n\n       First Bank is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the terms of the\n\n       First Bank Mortgage, and (8) neither Garmong, Fox, nor Signworks is entitled\n\n       to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In reaching these conclusions, we\n\n       reiterate that our conclusions do not affect the monetary judgments entered\n\n       against EdgeRock on Garmong\u2019s, Fox\u2019s, and Signworks\u2019s breach-of-contract\n\n       claims and those judgments remain in effect. On remand, we instruct the trial\n\n       court to enter an amended judgment consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n[88]   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the\n\n       matter is remanded with instructions.\n\n\n       Riley, J., and Weissmann, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 56 of 56\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                                   FILED\n                                                                               Jan 19 2024, 8:53 am\n\n                                                                                   CLERK\n                                                                               Indiana Supreme Court\n                                                                                  Court of Appeals\n                                                                                    and Tax Court\n\n\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT                                    ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEES C.H.\nEDGEROCK DEVELOPMENT, LLC                                  GARMONG &amp; SON, INC., AND\nMaggie L.

Garmong &amp;\n\n      Son, Inc. (\u201cGarmong\u201d), Fox Contractors Corp. (\u201cFox\u201d), and Signworks\n\n      (\u201cSignworks\u201d) to complete the \u201cTrails of Westfield\u201d (the \u201cProject\u201d), a\n\n      commercial building project along State Road 32 in the City of Westfield (the\n\n      \u201cCity\u201d). The Project included work that was to be completed on five different\n\n      parcels of land, which were owned by three different entities. EdgeRock owned\n\n      two of the parcels, which were secured by a mortgage that had been executed in\n\n      favor of First Bank Richmond (\u201cFirst Bank\u201d). ZPS Westfield, LLC (\u201cZPS\u201d)\n\n      owned two of the parcels and contracted directly with EdgeRock for the work\n\n      that was to be completed on its land in connection with the Project and paid its\n\n      financial obligations outlined in its contract with EdgeRock in full.\n\n\n[2]   EdgeRock, however, failed to satisfy its financial obligations under its contracts\n\n      with Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, all three of which sought to encumber\n\n      certain parcels connected with the Project with mechanic\u2019s liens and filed\n\n      breach-of-contract actions against EdgeRock. After finding, inter alia, that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens filed in connection with the Project were valid and had priority\n\n      over a portion of First Bank\u2019s mortgage interest in EdgeRock\u2019s property, the\n\n      trial court entered judgment against EdgeRock and in rem judgments against\n\n      EdgeRock\u2019s and ZPS\u2019s property. The trial court also determined that\n\n      EdgeRock was entitled to recover certain road-impact fees (the \u201cRIF Funds\u201d)\n\n      that had been paid in connection to the Project by the City.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 3 of 56\n\f[3]   ZPS and EdgeRock challenge the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding the\n\n      validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens. ZPS also challenges the\n\n      inclusion of uninstalled material in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against its\n\n      property as well as the propriety of the prejudgment interest awarded to\n\n      Signworks. First Bank challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the\n\n      mechanic\u2019s liens had priority over part of its recorded mortgage interest.\n\n      EdgeRock challenges various summary judgment rulings made by the trial\n\n      court, and multiple parties challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that\n\n      EdgeRock is entitled to receive the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[4]   We conclude that (1) both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n      and EdgeRock\u2019s property are invalid; (2) the cost of uninstalled material should\n\n      not have been in included in Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      and ZPS should not have been ordered to pay prejudgment interest to\n\n      Signworks; (3) to the extent that priority questions remain, First Bank\u2019s\n\n      mortgage interest, in its entirety, has priority; (4) the trial court did not err in\n\n      making the challenged summary judgment rulings; and (5) distribution of the\n\n      RIF Funds is stayed pending a ruling by the Hamilton Commercial Court in a\n\n      related matter regarding the priority of the secured interests in the funds and\n\n      any future ruling from this court regarding the RIF Funds should be consistent\n\n      with that of the Hamilton Commercial Court. We further conclude that the\n\n      trial court erred in denying First Bank\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees but that no\n\n      party is entitled to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, we note\n\n      that EdgeRock has not challenged the judgments against it relating to the\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024          Page 4 of 56\n\f      breach-of-contract claims brought by Garmong, Fox, and Signworks, and our\n\n      conclusions relating to the validity of the mechanic\u2019s liens do not alter those\n\n      judgments against EdgeRock in any way. Pursuant to our above-stated\n\n      conclusions, we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse\n\n      in part, and remand with instructions.\n\n\n\n      Facts and Procedural History\n      I.      Initiation of the Project\n[5]   In 2015, EdgeRock and its investors purchased numerous separate parcels of\n\n      undeveloped land totaling seventeen acres along State Road 32 in the City. The\n\n      parcels were subsequently divided into Lots 1 through 5 as depicted below:\n\n\n\n\n      Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 5 p. 82. The five lots were then zoned as follows:\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 5 of 56\n\f            \u2022    Lot 1 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a\n                 Starbucks);\n            \u2022    Lot 2 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Penn\n                 Station and Forum Credit Union);\n            \u2022    Lot 3 was zoned for retail business (and would eventually become a Crew\n                 Carwash);\n            \u2022    Lot 4 was zoned for multi-family apartments; and\n            \u2022    Lot 5 was zoned for retail business.\n\n      EdgeRock sold Lots 1 and 2 to ZPS in 2017, and, at some point, sold Lot 3 to\n\n      Dahm No. 49, LLC (\u201cDahm\u201d).1 EdgeRock maintained ownership of Lots 4\n\n      and 5.\n\n\n[6]   After purchasing Lots 1 and 2, ZPS contracted with EdgeRock to build two\n\n      structures and install related infrastructure on its property. ZPS\u2019s development\n\n      agreement for the construction and infrastructure on its property called for ZPS\n\n      to pay EdgeRock a total of $1,720,000.00. It is undisputed that ZPS paid the\n\n      entire amount it owed to EdgeRock, making its final payment in August of\n\n      2018.\n\n\n[7]   EdgeRock then contracted with Garmong to perform not only the work on\n\n      ZPS\u2019s property, but also work on the properties owned by EdgeRock and\n\n      Dahm. The total EdgeRock-Garmong contract amount was $3,253,390.00.\n\n      The EdgeRock-Garmong contract broke down the cost of Garmong\u2019s work into\n\n      two categories: \u201cLots 1 &amp; 2\u201d totaling $1,172,114.00 and \u201cInfrastructure\u201d\n\n      totaling $1,730,284.00. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. The contract also\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Dahm was not a party to the underlying litigation and does not participate in this appeal.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 6 of 56\n\f      included $110,000.00 in contingency funds and an eight percent management\n\n      fee ($240,992.00) payable to Garmong. Garmong later submitted several\n\n      change orders, including Change Order 3 in the amount of $434,528.00, which\n\n      included work on Lot 3. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n      contract. Fox had a subcontract with Garmong, which included work on all\n\n      five lots.\n\n\n[8]   As part of the Project, the City contracted with EdgeRock to build 175th Street\n\n      (which would run to the north of Lots 4 and 5 and to the south of Lots 1, 2, and\n\n      3) and install related infrastructure (the \u201c175th-Street Project\u201d). The 175th-\n\n      Street Project was to be funded, at least in part, by RIF Funds issued by the\n\n      City. The 175th-Street Project included \u201c17.6 acres,\u201d with ZPS\u2019s property\n\n      making up 10.2% of the total acreage of the project and EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n      making up 58.6% of the total acreage. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 9 p. 36. The\n\n      remaining acreage came from Dahm\u2019s property. EdgeRock contracted directly\n\n      with Fox to complete the 175th-Street Project, which included building 175th\n\n      Street and installing related infrastructure. The EdgeRock-Fox contract was for\n\n      a total of $1,831,008.25. ZPS was not a party to the EdgeRock-Fox contract.\n\n      Its sole involvement was quitclaiming certain land needed to construct 175th\n\n      Street to the City.\n\n\n[9]   In September of 2018, EdgeRock contracted with Signworks to install two signs\n\n      on ZPS\u2019s property for a total price of $115,521.33. ZPS was not a party to the\n\n      EdgeRock-Signworks contract.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 7 of 56\n\f       II. Issues with Payment/Garmong\u2019s First Mechanic\u2019s\n           Lien\n[10]   As the Project moved forward, EdgeRock\u2019s payments to Garmong became\n\n       somewhat sporadic. EdgeRock paid invoices that had been submitted by\n\n       Garmong on December 11, 2017, April 17, 2018, and June 1, 2018. EdgeRock\n\n       did not pay invoices that were submitted by Garmong on March 7, 2018, June\n\n       20, 2018, July 30, 2018, August 24, 2018, September 25, 2018, and October 30,\n\n       2018. On December 4, 2018, following five months of nonpayment from\n\n       EdgeRock, Garmong filed a notice of intention to hold a mechanic\u2019s lien, and\n\n       recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $2,140,722.51. The lien was\n\n       recorded on December 5, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Garmong Lien\u201d).\n\n\n       III. First Bank Mortgage\n[11]   During late 2018 or early 2019, EdgeRock sought financing from First Bank \u201cto\n\n       refinance the existing mortgages\u201d on the planned development \u201cand pay for the\n\n       construction work\u201d that had thus far been completed. Ultimately, EdgeRock\n\n       received a $4,900,000.00 commercial loan from First Bank \u201cto reimburse for\n\n       land development expense[s] and payoff existing mortgages on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d\n\n       Ex. Vol. 19 p. 125. In return, First Bank received a mortgage interest on Lots 4\n\n       and 5 (the \u201cFirst Bank Mortgage\u201d); an assignment of EdgeRock\u2019s interests in an\n\n       agreement with Citizens Wastewater of Westfield, LLC; a secured interest in\n\n       the RIF Funds; and guaranty from EdgeRock\u2019s executives, Austin Dalton and\n\n       R. Birch Dalton. First Bank\u2019s loan documents included: (1) a UCC financing\n\n       statement signed by EdgeRock, granting the Bank a security interest in the RIF\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 8 of 56\n\f       Funds; (2) a Security Agreement executed by EdgeRock, granting First Bank a\n\n       security interest in the RIF Funds; and (3) a UCC financing statement filed with\n\n       the Indiana Secretary of State, covering collateral including the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[12]   The First Bank Mortgage was duly recorded on February 25, 2019. It is\n\n       undisputed that proceeds from the loan were distributed as follows:\n\n\n                 Amount                 Purpose\n                 $2,140,722.51          Payment to secure release of the 2018 Garmong\n                                        Lien\n                 $250,000.00            Payment of Blocked Interest Account Funds (used\n                                        for payment of loan interest)\n                 $45,431.00             Payment of loan origination fee\n                 $3500.00               Payment of appraisal fee\n                 $1000.00               Payment of appraisal review fee\n                 $46.00                 Payment of fee for flood determination\n                 $23.00                 Payment of wire and UCC filing fees\n                 $9269.00               Payment of various title company charges\n                 $165.00                Payment of recording charges\n                 $2,028,443.62          Payment to Acquisition Lenders to secure release\n                                        of the Acquisition Mortgage\n                 $15,000.00             Payment of EdgeRock\u2019s legal fees\n                 $5000.00               Payment of insurance premium\n                 $401,399.87            Payment to EdgeRock\n\n\n       The amounts tendered to the Acquisition Lenders equaled the amounts\n\n       remaining due under their respective acquisition promissory notes and served to\n\n       secure release of the Acquisition Mortgage. Following Garmong\u2019s receipt of\n\n       the $2,140,722.51, the 2018 Garmong Lien was released.\n\n\n[13]   A condition of the First Bank Mortgage had been that First Bank would\n\n       \u201creceive a first priority mortgage on Lots 4 and 5.\u201d Tr. Vol. 6 p. 117. First\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 9 of 56\n\f       Bank had not been made aware prior to the closing of the First Bank Mortgage\n\n       that Garmong \u201chad an outstanding claim for work performed of over $1 million\n\n       in addition to the Garmong mechanic\u2019s lien of $2.1 million that was being paid\n\n       off at the closing.\u201d Tr. Vol. 6 p. 117.\n\n\n       IV. Continued Issues with Payment\n[14]   Garmong submitted an invoice to EdgeRock on November 19, 2018, in the\n\n       amount of $299,155.84. This invoice had not been included in the 2018\n\n       Garmong Lien because the due date for payment had not passed as of the date\n\n       that the lien had been recorded. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice. Garmong\n\n       submitted another invoice to EdgeRock in the amount of $643,886.80 on\n\n       January 23, 2019. EdgeRock did not pay this invoice.\n\n\n[15]   According to the terms of its subcontract with Garmong, Fox was to receive\n\n       $1,315,000.00. According to the terms of its direct contract with EdgeRock,\n\n       Fox was to receive $1,831,008.25. Fox was not paid in full for its work done\n\n       under either contract.\n\n\n[16]   Signworks submitted invoices to EdgeRock on November 29, 2018, January 28,\n\n       2019, and April 17, 2019. EdgeRock, however, did not make any payments to\n\n       Signworks outside of its initial $3000.00 deposit.\n\n\n       V.      The Mechanic\u2019s Liens\n[17]   On June 24, 2019, Signworks recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 1 in the\n\n       amount of $48,992.29 and a separate mechanic\u2019s lien against Lot 2 in the\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 10 of 56\n\f       amount of $59,039.04. On August 30, 2019, Fox recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\u2014\n\n       each in the sum of $1,213,228.23\u2014against ZPS\u2019s Lots 1 and 2 and EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       Lots 4 and 5. On September 4, 2019, Garmong recorded mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against Lots 4 and 5 in the amount of $1,009,055.62. The next day, Garmong\n\n       recorded mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1 and 2 in the same amount. On\n\n       September 10, 2019, Fox recorded additional mechanic\u2019s liens against Lots 1, 2,\n\n       4, and 5, each in the amount of $500,053.43. Litigation under cause number\n\n       29D05-1912-PL-11500 (\u201cCause No. PL-11500\u201d) soon followed.\n\n\n       VI. Lien Foreclosure Proceedings\n[18]   On December 9, 2019, Garmong filed suit under Cause No. PL-11500 against\n\n       EdgeRock, ZPS, First Bank, Fox, and Signworks, seeking to foreclose its\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and\n\n       damages. On March 4, 2020, Fox filed cross-claims against EdgeRock and\n\n       ZPS, seeking to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s liens and alleging breach of contract,\n\n       unjust enrichment, and violation of personal liability notice. On March 10,\n\n       2020, Fox filed a third-party complaint against the City in which it indicated\n\n       that it had named the City \u201cas a party to assert any interest it may have in the\n\n       Edge[R]ock Property and/or ZPS property.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 3 pp.\n\n       152, 153. On May 29, 2020, Garmong requested leave to amend its complaint\n\n       to dismiss its claims against Signworks and to add Signworks as a plaintiff to its\n\n       complaint. The trial court granted Garmong\u2019s motion and Garmong filed an\n\n       amended complaint listing Signworks as a plaintiff rather than a defendant.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 11 of 56\n\f       Counterclaims were subsequently filed against Garmong by EdgeRock and\n\n       Fox. The trial court scheduled trial starting on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n       VII. The RIF Funds\n[19]   On February 19, 2021, the City filed a motion for interpleader, in which it\n\n       sought \u201can order requiring the deposit of funds with the Court, declaring that\n\n       [the City] has satisfied its obligation under the [RIF] Credit Agreement, and\n\n       that its property is not encumbered by any parties to this matter, and ordering\n\n       its dismissal with prejudice.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 12. The City\n\n       claimed that it \u201cis in no position to determine how much should be disbursed to\n\n       each party that completed work on 175th.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 15.\n\n       Fox responded claiming that it \u201cis the only party in this lawsuit which\n\n       performed any work and supplied any materials for the construction of 175th\n\n       Street and the relocation of the Anna Kendall Drain [(the \u201cDrain\u201d)]. Fox is\n\n       entitled to all of the funds that will be interpleaded by [the City].\u201d Appellants\u2019\n\n       Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 28. First Bank also claimed to be entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n       While ZPS did not assert a formal claim for the RIF Funds in Cause No. PL-\n\n       11500, it asserted a priority interest in the RIF Funds in a separately filed\n\n       lawsuit in the Hamilton Commercial Court, under cause number 29D02-2107-\n\n       PL-5088 (\u201cCause No. PL-5088\u201d). This lawsuit, which was filed on July 20,\n\n       2021, remains pending.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The proceedings in the commercial court action were stayed by order of the court on June 21, 2022.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                            Page 12 of 56\n\f       VIII.            Competing Motions for Partial Summary\n                        Judgment\n[20]   On May 7, 2020, EdgeRock filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On\n\n       December 7, 2020, ZPS filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Ten days\n\n       later, the trial court issued an order holding all motions for summary judgment\n\n       in abeyance until trial began on January 21, 2021.\n\n\n[21]   On January 28, 2021, following the first two days of trial, the trial court issued\n\n       an order informing the parties that it would \u201cconsider summary judgment\n\n       motions prior to the next hearing date on April 9, 2021.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 16 p. 77. The trial court further ordered that\n\n\n               The parties are given until February 12, 2021[,] to file any new or\n               amended motions for summary judgment. The parties shall be\n               given until March 15, 2021[,] to file any responses to summary\n               judgment motions. A hearing will be set for the Court to hear\n               arguments on all summary judgment motions on March 24,\n               2021[.]\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 16 p. 77. Signworks, Fox, and Garmong moved for\n\n       partial summary judgment on February 12, 2021. Also on February 12, 2021,\n\n       ZPS and EdgeRock filed amended motions for partial summary judgment.\n\n\n       IX. The Trial Court\u2019s Orders\n[22]   On April 7, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Garmong\u2019s motion for\n\n       partial summary judgment and denying EdgeRock\u2019s motion for partial\n\n       summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that Garmong\u2019s\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 13 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid and that summary\n\n       judgment relating to Change Order 3 was improper because a material dispute\n\n       remained as to whether Change Order 3 had been approved by EdgeRock. The\n\n       trial court further found that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the\n\n       Drain were never part of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract; the consequential\n\n       damages waiver barred EdgeRock\u2019s claim for rent abatement, loss of future\n\n       business, and tortious interference with banking relationships; EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       tortious interference claims are barred by the waiver; and rent abatement paid\n\n       to ZPS is barred by the waiver.\n\n\n[23]   On April 28, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying\n\n       in part ZPS\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial\n\n       court found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on the unjust\n\n       enrichment claims brought by Garmong and Signworks. The trial court found\n\n       that summary judgment relating to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens filed against ZPS\u2019s property was improper because issues of\n\n       material fact remained as to whether the liens were valid, specifically whether\n\n       the liens were overstated. In denying summary judgment on the question of\n\n       whether the mechanic\u2019s liens were valid, the trial court found, as a matter of\n\n       law, that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien had been timely filed. The trial court further\n\n       found that ZPS was entitled to summary judgment on Garmong\u2019s, Signworks\u2019s,\n\n       and Fox\u2019s requests for attorney\u2019s fees, stating that it is undisputed that ZPS had\n\n       paid EdgeRock \u201call that it was obligated to pay under the terms of the\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 14 of 56\n\f       Development Agreement,\u201d and, as a result, \u201cGarmong, Signworks, and Fox\n\n       may not recover attorney\u2019s fees\u201d from ZPS. Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 83.\n\n\n[24]   On May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting in part and denying in\n\n       part Fox\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court\n\n       found, as a matter of law, that Fox\u2019s liens on EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid,\n\n       but found that issues of material fact existed as to the validity of Fox\u2019s liens on\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[25]   Also on May 12, 2021, the trial court issued an order granting Signworks\u2019s\n\n       motion for partial summary judgment. In this order, the trial court found that\n\n       Signworks\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s property were \u201cvalid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 100.\n\n\n[26]   Trial continued on all remaining issues. After the conclusion of trial, on May\n\n       25, 2022, the trial court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\n\n       judgment. With respect to Garmong\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the\n\n       trial court concluded as follows: (1) EdgeRock had breached its contract with\n\n       Garmong; (2) Garmong was entitled to foreclose its liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property; (3) Garmong\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property were valid and were not\n\n       overstated; (4) Garmong had not breached its contract with EdgeRock; (5) there\n\n       was no basis for EdgeRock\u2019s slander-of-title or fraud claims; and (6) there was\n\n       no basis for ZPS\u2019s slander-of-title claims.\n\n\n[27]   With respect to Fox\u2019s claims against EdgeRock and ZPS, the trial court\n\n       concluded that EdgeRock had breached its contract with Fox. The trial court\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 15 of 56\n\f       further concluded that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against both EdgeRock\u2019s property\n\n       and ZPS\u2019s property were valid and that Fox was entitled to foreclose its liens.\n\n\n[28]   With respect to Signworks\u2019s claims, the trial court concluded that EdgeRock\n\n       had breached its contract with Signworks. As a result of the breach, Signworks\n\n       was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from EdgeRock.\n\n\n[29]   With respect to questions relating to lien priority, the trial court concluded as\n\n       follows: (1) First Bank only had priority for the first $2,140,722.51 of its loan to\n\n       EdgeRock; (2) mechanic\u2019s liens take priority from the date the contractor begins\n\n       work; (3) equitable subrogation is not compatible with the Indiana Mechanic\u2019s\n\n       Lien Statute (the \u201cIMLS\u201d) and does not apply; (4) even if equitable subrogation\n\n       could apply, the equities favor Garmong and Fox; (5) First Bank\u2019s equitable\n\n       estoppel argument fails; (6) the \u201cspecific project\u201d language of Indiana Code\n\n       section 32-28-3-5(d) did not encompass First Bank\u2019s entire loan; and (7) First\n\n       Bank was entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[30]   Based on these conclusions, the trial court ordered the following:\n\n\n               1.     Judgment is entered in favor of Garmong and against\n               [EdgeRock] on Count 3 of Garmong\u2019s Amended Complaint in\n               the amount of $943,042.64, plus interest on the balance at the\n               rate of at 12% per year accruing from February 23, 2019 (the due\n               date of the final invoice). The interest accrued through May 25,\n               2022 is $367,709.12, making the total judgment on Count 3 of\n               Garmong\u2019s Amended Complaint as of today\u2019s date\n               $1,310,751.76, plus court costs.\n\n               2.       Judgment in rem is entered in favor of Garmong on Count\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 16 of 56\n\f        1 of Garmong\u2019s Amended Complaint against [EdgeRock\u2019s] Lots\n        4 and 5 in the amount of $943,042.64, plus interest on the\n        balance at the rate of at 12% per year accruing from February 23,\n        2019 (the due date of the final invoice), plus Garmong\u2019s\n        reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.

Our review of a summary judgment motion\n               is limited to those materials designated to the trial court.\n               Summary judgment is appropriate only where the designated\n               evidence shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and\n               the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For\n               summary judgment purposes, a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it bears on\n               the ultimate resolution of relevant issues. We view the pleadings\n               and designated materials in the light most favorable to the non-\n               moving party. Additionally, all facts and reasonable inferences\n               from those facts are construed in favor of the non-moving party.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024       Page 22 of 56\n\f       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4271050\"><a href=\"/opinion/4493797/pamela-webb-v-city-of-carmel-carmel-clay-parks-building-corporation-and/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe initial burden is on the summary-\n\n       judgment movant to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of fact as to\n\n       a determinative issue, at which point the burden shifts to the non-movant to\n\n       come forward with contrary evidence showing an issue for the trier of fact.\u201d\n\n       Hughley v.

Findings &amp; Conclusions\n[38]   In cases where the trial court enters findings of fact and conclusions thereon,\n\n       our standard of review is two-tiered:\n\n\n               [W]e first determine whether the evidence supports the trial\n               court\u2019s findings and second, we determine whether the findings\n               support the judgment. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous\n               when the record lacks any reasonable inference from the\n               evidence to support them and the trial court\u2019s judgment is clearly\n               erroneous if it is unsupported by the findings and the conclusions\n               which rely upon those findings. In determining whether the\n               findings on the judgment are clearly erroneous, we consider only\n               the evidence favorable to the judgment and all reasonable\n               inferences to be drawn therefrom.\n\n               In conducting our review, we cannot reweigh the evidence or\n               judge the credibility of any witnesses, and must affirm the trial\n               court\u2019s decision if the record contains any supporting evidence or\n               inferences. However, while we defer substantially to findings of\n               fact, we do not do so to conclusions of law. We evaluate\n               questions of law de novo and owe no deference to a trial court\u2019s\n               determination of such questions.\n\n\n       Roberts v.

Applying this interpretation to the\n\n       facts of this case, we turn our attention to the question of whether the trial court\n\n       erred in determining that Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property and EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n       i.

While this case could be considered instructive in so far as its holding\n       seems to be consistent with relevant Indiana authority, like the out-of-state cases cited by Garmong, it is not\n       binding precedent.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 28 of 56\n\f       a.      Garmong\u2019s Lien\n\n[47]   ZPS claims that the evidence established that the amount of Garmong\u2019s lien\n\n       includes amounts for work performed on its property, EdgeRock\u2019s property,\n\n       and Dahm\u2019s property. Garmong\u2019s Regional Manager, Mitch Hannum, who\n\n       had been involved with calculating the amount of the lien, testified at trial as\n\n       follows:\n\n\n               Q:     And so the amount of the lien that Garmong recorded on\n               [ZPS\u2019s] property is exactly the same as the amount of the lien it\n               recorded on EdgeRock\u2019s property.

Is that correct?\n               A:     We recorded liens for the entire project. So, yes, we knew\n               when we filed liens that work was done on all of the five parcels because\n               we performed work on all of the five parcels.\n               Q:     And the amount that you were claiming in ZPS\u2019s lien, you\n               knew at the time you executed the lien that it included amounts\n               that Garmong claimed it was owed for work on Lots 3, 4, and 5.\n               A:     Yes, I believe I just - I believe that\u2019s what I just said, yes.\n               Yes.\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024           Page 29 of 56\n\f       Tr.

Further, although Garmong asserts\n\n       otherwise, review of the invoices referenced by Garmong\u2019s counsel indicates\n\n       that the invoices do not appear to have included only work that benefited ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property. In sum, ZPS argues that \u201cGarmong\u2019s executives were right:\n\n       Garmong\u2019s lien on ZPS\u2019s Property includes amounts for work performed on\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s Property and Dahm\u2019s Property. This is fatal to Garmon\u2019s lien\n\n       claim against ZPS\u2019s Property and the trial court\u2019s Judgment enforcing\n\n       Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s Property should be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. pp. 44\u201345. We must agree with ZPS. Based on the evidence\n\n       presented to the trial court, we conclude that Garmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was\n\n       overstated such that it included costs associated with work that had not been\n\n       completed on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[49]   In Abbey Villas Development Corp. v.

Garmong asserts that\n\n       to the extent that its mechanic\u2019s lien against ZPS\u2019s property was overstated,\n\n       such overstatement was not intentional or the result of culpable negligence. We\n\n       conclude, however, that the evidence demonstrates otherwise.

Vol. IV pp. 242, 243. Given the lack of evidence relating to the value\n\n       of Fox\u2019s work on the 175th-Street Project on Lots 1 and 2, ZPS claims that Fox\n\n       knowingly overstated its mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property.\n\n\n[51]   The trial court appeared to acknowledge that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens may have\n\n       been overstated as it related to ZPS, finding that \u201ceven if they were [overstated],\n\n       they were not intentionally or negligently overstated.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App.\n\n       Vol. 2 p. 156. ZPS asserts that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that the\n\n       overstatement was not intentional or negligent, given the evidence\n\n       demonstrating that Fox had known when it had asserted the lien that the lien\n\n       had included costs associated with work that was not done on ZPS\u2019s property,\n\n       its overstatement was intentional. ZPS also asserts that the prejudice in this\n\n       regard was self-evident. We agree with ZPS on both assertions.\n\n\n[52]   ZPS claims that Fox failed to prove that its mechanic\u2019s liens represented the\n\n       value of its work on ZPS\u2019s property, noting that it did not bear the burden of\n\n       disproving the value but rather that Fox had the burden to prove the value of its\n\n       work. ZPS points to the fact that a large portion of Fox\u2019s work was completed\n\n       on Lot 3, which ZPS asserts provided no value to its property. ZPS also claims\n\n       that it did not benefit from the installation of the water and sewer work as it\n\n       already had access to water and does not tie into the new sewer line, which\n\n       allows Lot 4 access to the sewer system. Thus, ZPS claims that \u201c[t]his water\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 32 of 56\n\f       line and sewer lateral work provided no benefit whatsoever, directly or\n\n       indirectly, to ZPS\u2019s property\u2014yet because Fox included it in its lien against\n\n       ZPS\u2019s Property, the trial court\u2019s judgment forces ZPS to pay for it.\u201d ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 36.\n\n\n[53]   In arguing that it would be inequitable for it to bear the complete cost of the\n\n       175th-Street Project, ZPS points to the fact that its property constitutes only\n\n       10.2% of the property adjoining 175th Street. Fox seems to merely assert that\n\n       its work was common-infrastructure work that benefitted all five lots, including\n\n       ZPS\u2019s property. Again, Adamson testified that he had \u201cno way to know the\n\n       value of the work\u201d on ZPS\u2019s property but acknowledged that the work on 175th\n\n       Street had benefited property owned by EdgeRock and Dahm. Tr. Vol. IV p.\n\n       243. In sum, ZPS asserts that \u201cFox\u2019s inclusion of amounts in its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       liens that did not benefit ZPS, or for work which was not performed on ZPS\u2019s\n\n       Property and benefited multiple property owners, means it intentionally or\n\n       negligently overstated its liens and thus they are void.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 25.\n\n\n[54]   Similar to our conclusion relating to Garmong, we conclude that the evidence\n\n       demonstrates that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien included work on property that ZPS\n\n       did not own, and that Fox had known as much when it had filed the lien. As\n\n       such, we conclude that Fox\u2019s knowing overstatement rendered its mechanic\u2019s\n\n       lien against ZPS\u2019s property void.

Arguments Relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s Liens on EdgeRock\u2019s Property\n\n[55]   At the summary-judgment stage, EdgeRock, Garmong, and Fox sought\n\n       determinations as to the validity of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens\n\n       against EdgeRock\u2019s property. On April 7, 2021, the trial court determined that\n\n       \u201cGarmong\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on Edge[R]ock\u2019s property is valid as a matter of\n\n       law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 71. On May 13, 2021, the trial court\n\n       likewise determined that Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens, which related to both its direct\n\n       contract with EdgeRock and the Garmong subcontract, were valid as a matter\n\n       of law. In finding both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens to be valid as a\n\n       matter of law, the trial court determined that the liens had been timely filed and\n\n       that neither Garmong nor Fox had overstated the amount of its lien. Following\n\n       trial, the trial court reaffirmed its earlier determination that Garmong\u2019s and\n\n       Fox\u2019s mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property were valid.\n\n\n[56]   EdgeRock argues that both Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s liens should have been found\n\n       invalid as a matter of law because neither Garmong nor Fox limited their liens\n\n       to costs associated with work completed on EdgeRock\u2019s property but included\n\n       costs associated with work done on property owned by ZPS and Dahm.\n\n       EdgeRock asserts that as a result of Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s failure to separate out\n\n       the costs associated with work done on each individual property owner\u2019s\n\n       property,\n\n\n               [t]here are now effectively $4.8 million dollars\u2019 worth of liens on\n               lots owned by different people/entities when it is undisputed that\n               the cumulative amount owed is only $1.2 million. And on top of\n               that, the lien on Lot 3 has been removed altogether so that the\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 34 of 56\n\f               only lot benefiting from the work done on Lot 3 is not even in the\n               mix anymore. It is inequitable to allow Fox to pursue only ZPS\n               and EdgeRock without deducting the real, tangible value\n               provided by their work to Lot 3.\n\n\n       EdgeRock\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 55.\n\n\n[57]   Garmong claims that EdgeRock\u2019s status as the developer for the Project\n\n       subjected it to liability for the entire contract amount. Garmong asserts that if\n\n       EdgeRock \u201cis allowed to avoid the liens, the result is anything but equitable\u201d\n\n       and EdgeRock \u201cshould not be permitted to subdivide Garmong\u2019s lien rights for\n\n       the project to avoid paying Garmong.\u201d Garmong\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 43. Fox\n\n       also claims that it would be inequitable for EdgeRock \u201cto receive the benefit\n\n       and value of Fox\u2019s infrastructure work without having Edge[R]ock pay for it.\u201d\n\n       Fox\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 55. While both Garmong and Fox could clearly have\n\n       received, and in fact did receive, money judgments against EdgeRock for the\n\n       unpaid amount due under the parties\u2019 contracts, it does not necessarily follow\n\n       that Garmong and Fox could assert mechanic\u2019s liens for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property against EdgeRock\u2019s property.\n\n\n[58]   The parties have not cited to any Indiana authority creating an exception to the\n\n       common-ownership requirement that would extend EdgeRock\u2019s liability such\n\n       that its property can be encumbered by money owed for work done on\n\n       another\u2019s property by virtue of its status as the Project developer. We conclude\n\n       that the rationale for our conclusions relating to Garmong\u2019s and Fox\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 35 of 56\n\f       mechanic\u2019s liens on ZPS\u2019s property apply equally to the liens on EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       property. We further conclude, therefore, that the liens were overstated.\n\n\n[59]   The evidence set forth in the preceding section establishes that both Garmong\n\n       and Fox had known at the time they recorded their mechanic\u2019s liens that the\n\n       lien amounts included work that had been completed on all five parcels. Thus,\n\n       Garmong and Fox overstated their lien amounts when they recorded their\n\n       mechanic\u2019s liens against EdgeRock\u2019s property. Like their liens against ZPS\u2019s\n\n       property, their knowing overstatement has rendered their liens void.

This conclusion, however, has no effect on the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination that EdgeRock had breached its contracts with both\n\n       Garmong and Fox or the resulting breach-of-contract judgments entered against\n\n       EdgeRock.\n\n\n       iii.

Challenged Summary Judgment Rulings\n[67]   EdgeRock has challenged two of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings,\n\n       which, if found erroneous, could potentially affect the amount of Garmong\u2019s\n\n       breach-of-contract judgment against it.\n\n\n       1.      Change Order 3\n\n[68]   EdgeRock asserted below that it had not approved Change Order 3 and sought\n\n       summary judgment on the issue. In requesting summary judgment, EdgeRock\n\n       had claimed that \u201cGarmong could not recover amounts incurred pursuant to\n\n       Change Order #3 because EdgeRock never approved this Change Order in\n\n       writing as unambiguously required under the contract\u201d and had designated\n\n       supporting evidence.

For its part, Garmong\n\n       designated evidence indicating that EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 and had paid seventy-five percent of the amount due for Change Order\n\n       3 without complaint.\n\n\n[69]   The trial court denied EdgeRock\u2019s request for summary judgment, finding that\n\n       issues of fact precluded summary judgment. Specifically, the trial court found\n\n       that\n\n\n               Damian Etchison and Mitch Hannum both testified that\n               Edge[R]ock orally approved Change Order 3. This testimony\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024    Page 41 of 56\n\f         contradicts [EdgeRock\u2019s manager Birch] Dalton\u2019s testimony and\n         creates an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.\n         Edge[R]ock provided Garmong with the revised civil drawings\n         that were prepared by Edge[R]ock\u2019s own civil engineer and\n         asked Garmong to carry out the work depicted on those revised\n         civil drawings. If Garmong had not carried out Change Order 3,\n         construction on the Project could not have begun. All site\n         activity would have stopped after demolition.\n\n         Edge[R]ock also paid for seventy-five percent of Change Order 3.\n         When negotiating the $2.1 million payment for the release of the\n         November 2018 mechanic\u2019s lien, Edge[R]ock did not assert that\n         Change Order 3 was not approved. Edge[R]ock also claims in its\n         brief that the $2.1 million payment was a final payment, so\n         Edge[R]ock believes it has paid for the Change Order 3 work in\n         full.\n\n         Edge[R]ock paying for the Change Order 3 work gives rise to the\n         inference that Edge[R]ock approved Change Order 3. The Court\n         must construe all inferences that can be drawn from the\n         designated evidence in Garmong\u2019s favor. Hughley v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">15\n         N.E.3d 1000</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1003 (Ind. 2014). A reasonable factfinder could\n         conclude from Edge[R]ock\u2019s payment of Change Order 3 that\n         Edge[R]ock approved the Change Order. Thus, there is an issue\n         of fact for trial.\n\n\nAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 66\u201367 (emphasis in original, internal record\n\ncitation omitted).8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Following trial, the trial court found that Change Order 3 was valid. EdgeRock does not appear to\nspecifically challenge the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions relating to Change Order 3 in its final order,\ninstead focusing its argument on its belief that it had been entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                                Page 42 of 56\n\f[70]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence created an issue of\n\n       material fact as to whether EdgeRock had approved Change Order 3. The\n\n       designated evidence established that EdgeRock had orally approved other\n\n       change orders and had paid for seventy-five percent of the charges related to\n\n       Change Order 3 without objection. Witness statements also provided\n\n       conflicting evidence as to whether EdgeRock had orally approved Change\n\n       Order 3 before the included work commenced. The Indiana Supreme Court\n\n       has recognized that a contract providing that any modification must be in\n\n       writing may nevertheless be modified orally. See AM General LLC v. Armour, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">46\n\n       N.E.3d 436</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 n.3 (Ind. 2015) (citing Sees v.

Upon reviewing the parties\u2019 designated evidence, the\n\n       trial court determined that issues of material fact existed. Like the trial court,\n\n       we conclude that the designated evidence created an issue of material fact. As\n\n       such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to Change\n\n       Order 3.\n\n\n       2.      Scope-of-Work Question\n\n[71]   EdgeRock and Garmong filed competing motions for summary judgment on\n\n       the question of whether the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain\n\n       were included in the scope of work covered by the EdgeRock-Garmong\n\n       contract. EdgeRock claimed below that this work was included in the parties\u2019\n\n       contract and, because Garmong did not complete this work and EdgeRock was\n\n       forced to contract with Fox to complete the work, EdgeRock was entitled to\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 43 of 56\n\f       credit for costs associated with this work that had been paid to Garmong. The\n\n       trial court found, as a matter of law, that\n\n\n               [t]he scope of work listed in the contract did not include the\n               [175th-Street Project] or the drain relocation. These items were\n               thus not removed from Garmong\u2019s scope of work as they were\n               never part of Garmong\u2019s scope of work to begin with.\n               Edge[R]ock is not entitled to a contractual credit for the [175th-\n               Street Project] or the drain relocation.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 pp. 64\u201365. EdgeRock argues on appeal that the trial\n\n       court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Garmong on this issue.\n\n\n[72]   The designated evidence demonstrated that the EdgeRock-Garmong contract\n\n       provided that the contract sum was guaranteed \u201cnot to exceed\u201d $3,255,390.00.\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 225. The scope of work included in the contract\n\n       was detailed in Exhibit B of the contract. Exhibit B outlined both the work that\n\n       was to be completed by Garmong and the budget for said work. The budget\n\n       breakdown provided as follows:\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024         Page 44 of 56\n\fAppellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 240. As the budget breakdown indicates,\n\n$1,300,277.00 was budgeted for work that was to be completed on Lots 1 and 2\n\nand $1,953,113.00 was budgeted for infrastructure work. EdgeRock asserts that\n\nthe infrastructure work included all work that was needed to complete the\n\n175th-Street Project and to relocate the Drain. While the budget sheet does\n\ninclude costs in the infrastructure portion for \u201cAsphalt Paving,\u201d which, in\n\ntheory, could have been part of the funds necessary to construct 175th Street,\n\nthe budget breakdown does not appear to include any costs that would appear\n\nto apply to drain relocation as \u201c$0\u201d was allocated to plumbing. Appellants\u2019 Jt.\n\nApp. Vol. 2 p. 240.\n\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 45 of 56\n\f[73]   In finding that the 175th-Street Project and the relocation of the Drain were not\n\n       included in the scope of work of the EdgeRock-Garmong contract, the trial\n\n       court noted that adopting EdgeRock\u2019s interpretation of the included scope of\n\n       work would require it to violate the principles of contract interpretation and to\n\n       rewrite the parties\u2019 contract. Specifically, the trial court determined that\n\n\n               Adopting Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading would require the Court to strike\n               out the eight pages of the Guaranteed Maximum Price\n               Amendment listing the scope of work. That portion of the\n               Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment would serve no\n               purpose if the true scope of work was all the work depicted in the\n               drawings.\n\n               Garmong\u2019s reading of the contract by contrast harmonizes the\n               whole contract without eliminating any part of it. The only\n               reading that makes the document into a cohesive whole is that\n               the drawing log lists the source material for the narrower eight-\n               page scope of work to be undertaken by Garmong. Garmong\u2019s\n               reading is also consistent with the drawings themselves, which\n               depict a phased project. Edge[R]ock\u2019s reading of the contract\n               would eliminate the phased aspect of the Project as Garmong\n               would be carrying out all phases at once.\n\n\n       Appellants\u2019 Jt. App. Vol. 2 p. 64.\n\n\n[74]   We agree with the trial court that the designated evidence establishes as a\n\n       matter of law that the 175th-Street and Drain projects were not included in the\n\n       scope of work set forth in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract. In claiming that\n\n       these projects were included, or that a question of material fact existed as to\n\n       whether they were, EdgeRock points to the following pictures which it claims\n\n       prove that drain-relocation work was \u201cfoundational work that had to be\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 46 of 56\n\fcompleted at the beginning of the Project\u201d and thus must have been included in\n\nthe EdgeRock-Garmong contract:\n\n\n\n\nEdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 22 (noting that the original pictures could be found at\n\nEx. Vol. 19 pp. 4, 7 but that it had added the arrows and boxes). EdgeRock\n\nargues that these pictures, when considered together with the budget line item\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024   Page 47 of 56\n\f       including $1,179,997.00 for earth moving, with a separate amount included for\n\n       earth moving on Lots 1 and 2, \u201cprovide the plans for moving the stream and\n\n       drain as part of the base contract.\u201d EdgeRock\u2019s Reply Br. p. 23. We disagree.\n\n       Rather, we conclude that the pictures relied on by EdgeRock fall short both of\n\n       proving or creating an issue of material fact as to whether that drain-relocation\n\n       work was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract as they merely depict\n\n       where the original drain was and to where it was subsequently relocated but do\n\n       not address whether the cost was included in the EdgeRock-Garmong contract.\n\n       Because the designated evidence falls short of either proving EdgeRock\u2019s\n\n       proffered interpretation or creating an issue of material fact on the question, we\n\n       further conclude that the award of summary judgment in favor of Garmong on\n\n       the scope-of-work question was appropriate.\n\n\n       D.      RIF Funds\n[75]   Noting First Bank\u2019s secured interest in the RIF Funds, the trial court initially\n\n       awarded the RIF Funds to First Bank. In doing so, the trial court rejected Fox\u2019s\n\n       claim to the RIF Funds. In its order on the parties\u2019 motions to correct error, the\n\n       trial court acknowledged that ZPS had filed suit against EdgeRock in Cause\n\n       No. PL-5088 and that that action was pending. The trial court amended its\n\n       prior order to award the RIF Funds to EdgeRock. EdgeRock claims that the\n\n       trial court\u2019s determination is correct because pursuant to its contract with the\n\n       City, it is entitled to the RIF Funds.\n\n\n[76]   First Bank contends that the trial court\u2019s original order was correct with respect\n\n       to the RIF Funds because it holds a first-priority secured interest in the RIF\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024     Page 48 of 56\n\f       Funds. First Bank argues that the RIF Agreement was a contract between the\n\n       City and EdgeRock and that Fox has no claims to the RIF Funds under the\n\n       contract and that Fox\u2019s claim on the RIF Funds is not supported by law. First\n\n       Bank likewise argues that ZPS has no claim to the RIF Funds as it has failed to\n\n       offer any evidence in the instant case which supports ZPS\u2019s assertion that it has a\n\n       secured interest in the funds. Furthermore, to the extent that Fox and others\n\n       assert that First Bank is not entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not\n\n       asserted a judicial claim against the funds, First Bank argues that it was not\n\n       required to do so.\n\n\n[77]   Fox contends that it is entitled to the RIF Funds. In support of its claim, Fox\n\n       notes that it brought the City into the litigation and asserts that it was the only\n\n       party to incur any costs associated with or do any of the work on the 175th-\n\n       Street Project. Fox asserts that the use of impact fees, such as the RIF Funds,\n\n       are controlled by Indiana Code section 36-7-4-1300 et seq., which indicates that\n\n       such funds are to be used to mitigate costs directly in connection with projects\n\n       for the construction of infrastructure, such as roads, public ways, bridges,\n\n       drains, and drainage. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-7-4-1305</span><pre class=\"inline\">, -1309. Fox claims that\n\n       because it built the 175th-Street Project but was never paid for its work, it is\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds. Fox argues that while other entities have claimed to\n\n       have a right to the RIF Funds, it was the only party to assert a formal claim for\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024      Page 49 of 56\n\f       the funds in the instant lawsuit.9 Fox also argues that EdgeRock was not\n\n       entitled to the RIF Funds because it had not incurred any costs associated with\n\n       the 175th-Street Project. EdgeRock contests this argument, claiming that due to\n\n       the allegedly substandard quality of Fox\u2019s work, it had to hire another\n\n       contractor to finish the job. Fox does not have a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds.\n\n\n[78]   For its part, ZPS contends that it has a secured interest in the RIF Funds. It\n\n       asserts, however, that \u201c[g]iven the multiple interests in the RIF Funds, many of\n\n       which were not represented or addressed in this action, and given that\n\n       Edge[R]ock did not even assert a claim to the RIF Funds, the trial court\u2019s\n\n       award was erroneous and must be reversed.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 57. ZPS\n\n       asserts that as of May 24, 2021, EdgeRock owed ZPS $441,879.52 and that in\n\n       relation to this debt, ZPS had secured its interest in the RIF Funds. ZPS argues\n\n       that \u201c[e]ntitlement to the RIF Funds should be determined by the Hamilton\n\n       County Commercial Court, where all entitles with a secured interest in\n\n       Edge[R]ock\u2019s assets are parties.\u201d ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 49. Thus, ZPS claims that\n\n       we should \u201creverse the award of RIF Funds to Edge[R]ock and remand with\n\n       instructions to the Hamilton County Clerk to continue holding the RIF Funds\n\n       pending resolution of\u201d Cause No. PL-5088. ZPS\u2019s Reply Br. p. 54.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n        Fox classifies First Bank\u2019s claimed interest in the RIF Funds as being a private debt obligation that was\n       unrelated to the construction of 175th Street.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024                             Page 50 of 56\n\f[79]   Given that at least one party, i.e., First Bank, has a secured interest in the RIF\n\n       Funds, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding the RIF Funds to\n\n       EdgeRock. However, given the allegedly competing secured interests in the\n\n       funds, not all of which are represented in this action but all of which are\n\n       represented in Cause No. PL-5088, we instruct the trial court to stay\n\n       distribution of the funds in this case pending a determination of priority of the\n\n       competing secured interests by the Hamilton Commercial Court. Moreover,\n\n       any future rulings by the trial court regarding the RIF Funds should be\n\n       consistent with the priority determination made by the Hamilton Commercial\n\n       Court in Cause No. PL-5088.\n\n\n       E.

First Bank alleged that EdgeRock had\n\n       defaulted on the loan agreement \u201cas a result of, among other things,: a. after an\n\n       extension of the maturing date, the loan matured on November 19, 2020; and b.\n\n       the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens by Garmong and Fox, and the failure of\n\n       [EdgeRock] to pay those mechanic\u2019s liens and claims.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Jt.

Mortgagor\n               agrees to pay expenses for tender to inspect, valuate, appraise\n               and preserve the Property and for any recordation costs of\n               releasing the Property from this Security Instrument. Expenses\n               include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees after\n               default and referral to an attorney not a salaried employee of\n               Lender. These expenses are due and payable immediately. If not\n               paid immediately, these expenses will bear interest from the date\n               of payment until paid in full at the highest interest rate in effect as\n               provided for in the terms of the Secured Debts. In addition, to\n               the extent permitted by the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n               Mortgagor agrees to pay the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred\n               by Lender to protect Lender\u2019s rights and interests in connection\n               with any bankruptcy proceedings initiated by or against\n               Mortgagor.\n\n\n       Ex. Vol. 19 p. 141. The mortgage documents further provide that\n\n\n               On or after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may\n               use any and all remedies Lender has under state or federal law or\n               in any document related to the Secured Debts. Any amounts\n               advanced on Mortgagor\u2019s behalf will be immediately and may be\n               added to the balance owing under the Secured Debts.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 22A-PL-1968 | January 19, 2024        Page 53 of 56\n\f       Ex.

Ex.\n\n       Vol. 19 p. 141. First Bank asserts that EdgeRock has defaulted in two ways,\n\n       neither of which any party appears to contest occurred. Given First Banks\u2019s\n\n       seemingly undisputed claim that EdgeRock has defaulted on the First Bank\n\n       Mortgage, we conclude that pursuant to the terms of the First Bank Mortgage,\n\n       First Bank adequately demonstrated that EdgeRock had defaulted on the\n\n       parties\u2019 agreement, and, as a result, is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the\n\n       express terms of the mortgage agreement.\n\n\n       2.      Requests for Appellate Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n[85]   Garmong, Fox, and Signworks each request an award of appellate attorney\u2019s\n\n       fees. The IMLS provides at Indiana Code section 32-28-3-14 that \u201ca plaintiff or\n\n       lienholder who recovers a judgment in any sum is entitled to recover reasonably\n\n       attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d \u201cThe statute also encompasses attorney\u2019s fees associated with\n\n       appellate proceedings.\u201d Ambrose v.

Signworks\u2019s Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 17. Signworks does not have a\n\n       mechanic\u2019s lien against EdgeRock\u2019s property and is therefore not entitled to an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees under the IMLS. Moreover, while Indiana\n\n       Appellate Rule 66(E) provides that this court may assess damages, including an\n\n       award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, if an appeal is frivolous or in bad faith, we\n\n       \u201cuse extreme restraint when exercising this power because of the potential\n\n       chilling effect upon the exercise of the right to appeal.\u201d Kelley v.

The two\nbegan messaging on Instagram, where Boykins used the name \u201cTurbo Hefner.\u201d\nSoon thereafter, while still seventeen, T.M. moved in with Boykins, and Boykins\nbegan having her engage in prostitution. Boykins created online profiles for T.M.\non the website Seeking Arrangements and, initially, handled messaging those who\nresponded. Boykins also took nude photos of T.M. on his cell phone \u201c[t]o send to\n\fcustomers.\u201d At least one of the sexually explicit photos that Boykins took of T.M.\nfor \u201cbusiness, to send out\u201d was found on his phone. The phone also contained\nanother explicit photo that T.M. sent to Boykins at his request. Boykins sent that\nphoto from his phone to a contact labeled \u201cDavid from Seeking Arrangements.\u201d In\nboth photos, T.M. was seventeen.\n\n       A federal grand jury indicted Boykins on charges of sex trafficking, sex\ntrafficking of a minor, and production and distribution of child pornography. He\nwas arrested, pleaded not guilty, and proceeded to trial. The district court1 denied\nBoykins\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal, and the jury found Boykins guilty on\nall counts. Boykins now appeals, arguing that the district court improperly admitted\ninsufficiently authenticated evidence and that the properly admitted evidence was\ninsufficient to support the child pornography convictions.\n\n        We first address Boykins\u2019s argument that the district court erred by admitting\ninsufficiently authenticated electronic-communication and social-media evidence\nobtained from Boykins\u2019s phone. Boykins stipulated to the admissibility of the\nchallenged evidence at trial, yet now claims error based on its admission. We have\nrepeatedly held that a defendant waives his right to challenge the admission of\nevidence after stipulating to its admissibility. See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez,\n984 F.3d 704, 710 (8th Cir. 2021) (stipulating to admissibility of a transcript of an\naudio recording precluded the defendant from subsequently claiming error based on\nalleged inaccuracies in that transcript); see also United States v. Mezzanatto, 513\nU.S. 196, 202 (1995) (\u201c[A]greements to waive evidentiary rules are generally\nenforceable even over a party\u2019s subsequent objections.\u201d). At the beginning of trial,\nBoykins stipulated to the admissibility of all exhibits except two photos not at issue\nin this appeal.

Boykins raised his objection to the authentication of the electronic-\ncommunication and social-media evidence for the first time on appeal, so we review\nfor plain error. 2\n\n       \u201cTo satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that\nthe item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d Fed.

Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th Cir.\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Boykins argues that he preserved these\narguments for appeal by objecting to a lack of foundation when FBI Special Agent\nDaniel Turner and the Government attributed messages from the phone to Boykins\nduring Turner\u2019s testimony. Boykins made no mention of authentication, nor is it\nclear that he intended to challenge the admissibility of the text messages themselves.\nEven if the objection had sufficed to preserve this narrow authentication challenge,\nwe would conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding\nsufficient authentication of the phone and its contents. See United States v. Turner,\n934 F.3d 794, 798 (8th Cir. 2019).\n                                          -3-\n\fthe document is what it is asserted to be.\u201d United States v. Ramirez-Martinez, 6\nF.4th 859, 866 (8th Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Boykins first challenges the admission of electronic-communication evidence\nextracted from the cell phone, specifically photos and messages. Testimony from\nT.M. and Special Agent Turner established that the phone belonged to Boykins, that\nBoykins gave the number associated with the phone to law enforcement as his\ncontact number, that Boykins admitted to arresting officers that the phone was his,\nthat Boykins kept the phone password protected, that T.M. never used it, and that\nT.M. never saw anyone except Boykins use it. Special Agent Turner also stated that\nthere were messages on the phone where the author referred to himself by Boykins\u2019s\nnickname \u201cTurbo.\u201d T.M. identified a sexually explicit photograph of herself from\nthe phone that she testified was taken by Boykins on his phone \u201c[f]or business, to\nsend out\u201d when she was seventeen years old. T.M. further testified that, at Boykins\u2019s\nrequest, she sent him sexually explicit photographs of herself when she was still\nseventeen for use in the business, and she specifically identified one of those photos\nthat was subsequently sent from Boykins\u2019s phone to someone else. The court did\nnot plainly err in admitting the messages and photo evidence from the phone, as the\nevidence presented by the Government \u201ccertainly meets the undemanding \u2018rational\nbasis\u2019 standard\u201d and suffices to properly authenticate them. See id. at 866-67; United\nStates v. Turner, 934 F.3d at 798.\n\n       Boykins also challenges the admission of content from his Instagram account.\nWe recognize that authentication of social media evidence may present some\n\u201cspecial challenges because of the great ease with which a social media account may\nbe falsified or a legitimate account may be accessed by an imposter.\u201d Lamm, 5 F.4th\nat 947. Nonetheless, we have been clear that, just as with phone messages and\nimages, \u201cthe Government may authenticate social media evidence with\ncircumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the social media account.\u201d Id. at\n948. Here, T.M. testified to messaging with Boykins via the account. The author of\nmessages from the account referred to himself by Boykins\u2019s known nickname, and\nthe account was registered to his email. Thus, the court did not plainly err in\nadmitting the social media content at trial.\n                                         -4-\n\f      Boykins also argues that, because the challenged electronic-communication\nand social-media evidence should have been excluded, insufficient evidence\nsupported the child-pornography convictions. Because the challenged evidence was\nproperly admitted, this argument also fails. See United States v. Pliego, 578 F.3d\n938, 941 (8th Cir. 2009) (standard of review). A reasonable jury could find Boykins\nguilty of both production and distribution of child pornography based on the\nevidence described above. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a), 2252(a)(2).\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                 United States Court of Appeals\n                            For the Eighth Circuit\n                        ___________________________\n\n                                No. 23-1652\n                        ___________________________\n\n                            United States of America\n\n                                     Plaintiff - Appellee\n\n                                        v.\n\n                 Keshawn Boykins, also known as Turbo Hefner\n\n                                   Defendant - Appellant\n                                 ____________\n\n                    Appeal from United States District Court\n                  for the Eastern District of Arkansas - Central\n                                 ____________\n\n                         Submitted: December 11, 2023\n                            Filed: January 19, 2024\n                                 [Unpublished]\n                                ____________\n\nBefore GRUENDER, GRASZ, and KOBES, Circuit Judges.\n                          ____________\nPER CURIAM.\n\n      T.M. met defendant Keshawn Boykins when she was seventeen. The two\nbegan messaging on Instagram, where Boykins used the name \u201cTurbo Hefner.\u201d\nSoon thereafter, while still seventeen, T.M. moved in with Boykins, and Boykins\nbegan having her engage in prostitution. Boykins created online profiles for T.M.\non the website Seeking Arrangements and, initially, handled messaging those who\nresponded. Boykins also took nude photos of T.M. on his cell phone \u201c[t]o send to\n\fcustomers.\u201d At least one of the sexually explicit photos that Boykins took of T.M.\nfor \u201cbusiness, to send out\u201d was found on his phone. The phone also contained\nanother explicit photo that T.M. sent to Boykins at his request. Boykins sent that\nphoto from his phone to a contact labeled \u201cDavid from Seeking Arrangements.\u201d In\nboth photos, T.M. was seventeen.\n\n       A federal grand jury indicted Boykins on charges of sex trafficking, sex\ntrafficking of a minor, and production and distribution of child pornography. He\nwas arrested, pleaded not guilty, and proceeded to trial. The district court1 denied\nBoykins\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal, and the jury found Boykins guilty on\nall counts. Boykins now appeals, arguing that the district court improperly admitted\ninsufficiently authenticated evidence and that the properly admitted evidence was\ninsufficient to support the child pornography convictions.\n\n        We first address Boykins\u2019s argument that the district court erred by admitting\ninsufficiently authenticated electronic-communication and social-media evidence\nobtained from Boykins\u2019s phone. Boykins stipulated to the admissibility of the\nchallenged evidence at trial, yet now claims error based on its admission. We have\nrepeatedly held that a defendant waives his right to challenge the admission of\nevidence after stipulating to its admissibility. See, e.g., United States v.

Limbaugh, Jr., United States District Judge for\nthe Eastern District of Missouri.\n\f      Counsel has moved for leave to withdraw and filed a brief under Anders v.\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). He argues that the sentence is substantively\nunreasonable because the district court gave insufficient weight to Wilson\u2019s history\nand characteristics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\n       The district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence. The\nrecord reflects that the court adequately considered the section 3553(a) factors\u2014\nincluding all of the information Wilson presented for the court\u2019s consideration\u2014and\ndid not clearly err in weighing the factors. See United States v.
