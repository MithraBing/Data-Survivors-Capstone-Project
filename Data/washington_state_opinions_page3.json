PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 29.03 (West 2019), \u00a7 46.04 (West Supp. 2023). The\njury found an enhancement allegation to be \u201ctrue\u201d and assessed Appellant\u2019s\npunishment at eighty years\u2019 imprisonment in the Institutional Division of the Texas\n\fDepartment of Criminal Justice and a $7,500 fine for the aggravated-robbery\noffense, and ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a $5,000 fine for the unlawful-possession-\nof-a-firearm offense. See id. \u00a7 12.42(b). The trial court sentenced him accordingly.\n      Appellant pled guilty before the jury to unlawfully possessing a firearm as a\nfelon, and not guilty to the charge of aggravated robbery. At the guilt/innocence\nphase of trial, the State called five witnesses, including Liying Chen, who owned\nand worked at the Rose Garden Spa where Appellant entered on March 21, 2022\nwith a firearm and demanded money. The jury saw surveillance footage that showed\nAppellant striking, pistol whipping, and stomping on Chen while dragging her\naround the salon. The State presented photographs taken immediately after the\nrobbery of Chen\u2019s bloody, swollen face and body; testimony was also presented that\nAppellant\u2019s fingerprints and palm prints were found at the scene.\n      Appellant testified that he was \u201cout of [his] mind on Xanax\u201d when he entered\nthe Rose Garden Spa, and admitted that he \u201cbrutalized [Chen] because [his]\njudgment was clouded.\u201d He likewise agreed that he hit Chen with a firearm, but\n\u201cwas just trying to get [his] money back.\u201d The jury found him guilty of both\noffenses, and the State called four witnesses at the punishment phase, including two\nvictims of a home burglary that Appellant committed in 2012. Appellant testified\nduring the punishment phase, and called seven additional witnesses.\n      Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a motion to withdraw in this\ncourt. The motion is supported by a brief in which counsel professionally and\nconscientiously examines the record and applicable law and concludes that there are\nno arguable issues to present on appeal. Counsel provided Appellant with a copy of\nthe brief, a copy of the motion to withdraw, an explanatory letter, and a copy of both\nthe clerk\u2019s record and the reporter\u2019s record. Counsel also advised Appellant of his\nright to review the record and file a response to counsel\u2019s brief and of his right to\n\n\n                                          2\n\ffile a petition for discretionary review.

See TEX.\nCODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 62.051 (West Supp. 2023), art. 62.102 (West 2018).\nOn June 16, 2020, pursuant to the terms of a negotiated plea agreement between\nAppellant and the State, the trial court deferred finding Appellant guilty, and placed\n\fhim on deferred adjudication community supervision for a period of five years. As\nconditions of his community supervision, Appellant was required, among other\nthings, to follow all state and federal laws, report to his community supervision\nofficer as instructed, and pay a $1,000 fine and court costs.\n      The State subsequently filed a motion to revoke Appellant\u2019s community\nsupervision and to adjudicate his guilt, alleging that Appellant \u201cfailed to abstain from\nthe use of drugs . . . to wit: Cocaine.\u201d On October 10, 2022, the trial court held a\nhearing on the State\u2019s motion, during which Appellant pled \u201ctrue\u201d to this allegation\nand asked the trial court to continue his community supervision.             Upon the\nconclusion of the hearing, the trial court found the sole violation alleged in the\nState\u2019s motion to be \u201ctrue,\u201d adjudicated Appellant guilty, revoked his community\nsupervision, and assessed Appellant\u2019s punishment at eight years\u2019 imprisonment in\nthe Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n      Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a motion to withdraw in this\ncourt. The motion is supported by a brief in which counsel professionally and\nconscientiously examines the record and applicable law and concludes that there are\nno arguable issues to present on appeal. Counsel provided Appellant with a copy of\nthe brief, a copy of the motion to withdraw, an explanatory letter, and a copy of both\nthe clerk\u2019s record and the reporter\u2019s record. Counsel also advised Appellant of his\nright to review the record and file a response to counsel\u2019s brief and of his right to\nfile a petition for discretionary review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 68. Therefore, court-\nappointed counsel has complied with the requirements of Anders v. California, 386\nU.S. 738 (1967); Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex. Crim.

Following the procedures outlined in Anders and Schulman,\nwe have independently reviewed the record, and we agree that the appeal is without\nmerit. Here, Appellant pled \u201ctrue\u201d to the sole allegation in the State\u2019s motion, which\nthe trial court accepted and found to be \u201ctrue.\u201d We note that proof of one violation\nof the terms and conditions of a probationer\u2019s community supervision is sufficient\nto support the trial court\u2019s revocation order.

App.\u2014Eastland 2015, pet. ref\u2019d).\nIn this regard, a plea of \u201ctrue\u201d standing alone is sufficient to support a trial court\u2019s\ndecision to revoke a probationer\u2019s community supervision.

PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 19.02, 71.02 (West Supp. 2023). The\njury then assessed punishment at confinement in the Correctional Institutions\n\n\n      1\n       Appellant was originally indicted in 2018 and then reindicted in 2021.\n\fDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for a term of sixty-five years,\nfifty years, and twenty years, respectively. The trial court sentenced Appellant in\naccordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and ordered that the sentences were to run\nconcurrently.\n      Appellant raises four issues on appeal. First, he argues that his convictions\nfor murder and felony murder violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution\nof the United States. Second, he maintains that the evidence is insufficient to support\nhis convictions for murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal\nactivity. In his third issue on appeal, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when\nit denied Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. And in his fourth issue on appeal,\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of gang\ntattoos that did not belong to Appellant. We affirm in part and vacate in part.\n                           Factual and Procedural History\n      At approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 13, 2018, Odessa Police Department\n(OPD) Officer Brandon Teneyck responded to a call about a gunshot victim; the\nshooting occurred outside an Odessa convenience store. When Officer Teneyck\narrived at the scene, he determined that the shooting victim, Treginale White, was\nstill breathing. Officer Teneyck attempted to provide first aid, to secure the scene\nof the crime, and to give information to dispatch about the chaotic scene. Shortly\nafter Officer Teneyck arrived, an ambulance arrived as well. White did not survive\nhis gunshot wounds and his death was ruled a homicide.\n      OPD Sergeant Justin Caid testified that at the time of the investigation, he was\na detective in the robbery/homicide unit of the Criminal Investigation Division\n(CID). Sergeant Caid arrived on the scene at approximately 3:15 a.m. and began his\ninvestigation into the shooting. Sergeant Caid detected the presence of blood where\nWhite had been lying before emergency medical personnel transported him for\nmedical treatment. An inspection of the area also revealed that there were bullet\n                                           2\n\fdefects in a maroon Cadillac that was associated with White, discharged cartridge\ncasings from a .40 caliber firearm, and pieces of projectile jacketing. Sergeant Caid\nconducted interviews with multiple witnesses at the scene. One witness\u2014who came\nforward after the shooting\u2014testified that he heard four gunshots and that he saw\nAppellant shoot White.\n      Sergeant Caid obtained surveillance footage recorded from inside the\nconvenience store. The video contained footage from two different angles: one\nfocused closer to the cash register, but with a view of the front door and just outside\nof the front of the store, and one with a wider view of the store that shows the front\nwindows and the outside of the front of the store. An OPD officer with CID edited\nthe footage so that the videos appeared as one. The jury saw the footage. The jury\nalso saw other versions of the same video; some in slow motion and others that\nhighlighted Appellant.\n      The video shows that as Appellant was standing in line at the cash register, a\nman later identified as Christopher George entered the store and caught Appellant\u2019s\nattention. Appellant and George then ran out the door. As Appellant ran out the\ndoor, he raised his arms and ran toward White.\n      Officer Caid testified that the surveillance footage showed that Appellant was\nputting pressure on his right side as he was running out of the convenience store.\nAccording to Officer Caid, that was a common action if an unretained (unholstered)\nweapon is tucked in a waistband.        Appellant\u2019s former girlfriend testified that\nAppellant is right-handed, and that he frequently carried a firearm in his waistband.\n      As Appellant, with his arms raised, went toward White, four gunshots rang\nout and White fell to the ground; Appellant ran away.\n      Law enforcement personnel determined that Appellant was the one who had\nshot and killed White, Officers later apprehended Appellant in California.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      The State presented evidence of Appellant\u2019s gang affiliation.             Gang\nIntelligence Officer Jeremy Berry testified that, although Appellant was not\nimmediately identified as being involved in a gang, Appellant later admitted that he\nwas a member of the Rollin 60s Crips (Crips). Officer Berry also testified that\nGeorge was identified as being involved with the Crips. Over Appellant\u2019s objection,\nthe trial court admitted evidence pertaining to George\u2019s tattoos. The tattoos\npurportedly showed his affiliation with the Crips. Both Appellant and George had\ntattoos related to the Crips. The trial court also admitted photographs of Appellant\u2019s\ntattoos into evidence. The jury also heard testimony that White was a Blood gang\nmember and was on parole at the time of his death for the murder of a Crips gang\nmember.\n      As we have said, following the close of evidence, the jury found Appellant\nguilty of the offenses of murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal\nactivity. Appellant timely filed a motion for new trial, wherein he alleged two\ncomplaints: (1) that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and \u201cdid not meet the\nrelevant standard required for conviction\u201d, and (2) that Appellant was convicted for\ntwo offenses of the same conduct (murder and felony murder). Appellant later\namended the motion for new trial to include an allegation that the State failed to\ndisclose exculpatory and material evidence: the State\u2019s lead prosecutor and OPD\nDetective Trent Autrey were in a long-term relationship with one another. The trial\ncourt conducted a hearing on the motion for new trial and denied it.\n      Issue One: A Violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause Occurred\n      In Appellant\u2019s first issue, he claims that his convictions for murder and felony\nmurder violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution of the United States.\nBoth convictions are related to the murder of the same victim: Treginale White.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fAppellant and the State both contend that the proper remedy is to vacate the felony\nmurder conviction.2 We agree.\n        1. Standard of Review\n        The Fifth Amendment provides that no person \u201cshall . . . be subject for the\nsame offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. V.\nThe United States Supreme Court has concluded that the Fifth Amendment offers\nthree separate constitutional protections: (1) protection against a second prosecution\nfor the same offense after acquittal; (2) protection against a second prosecution for\nthe same offense after conviction; and (3) protection against multiple punishments\nfor the same offense. Cavazos, 203 S.W.3d at 336 (citing N.C. v. Pearce, 395 U.S.\n711, 717 (1969), overruled on other grounds by Ala. v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989)).\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause imposes few, if any, limitations on the legislative\npower to establish and define offenses. Ex parte Hawkins, 6 S.W.3d 554, 556 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1999) (citing Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977)). The legislature,\ntherefore, determines whether offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes\nby defining the \u201callowable unit of prosecution.\u201d Id. (citing Sanabria v. U.S., 437\nU.S. 54, 69-70 (1978)).\n\n\n\n        2\n          To preserve a double jeopardy complaint, the burden is on the defendant to raise\u2014in some way\u2014\na double jeopardy objection \u201cat or before the time the charge is submitted to the jury.\u201d Langs v. State, 183\nS.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (citing to Gonzalez v. State, 973 S.W.2d 427, 431 (Tex. App.\u2014\nAustin 1998), aff\u2019d, 8 S.W.3d 640 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000)). However, because double jeopardy protections\nare fundamental, a double jeopardy claim may be raised for the first time on appeal if: (1) \u201cthe undisputed\nfacts show the double jeopardy violation is clearly apparent on the face of the record\u201d and (2) \u201cwhen\nenforcement of the usual rules of procedural default serves no legitimate state interest.\u201d Id. (citing\nGonzalez, 8 S.W.3d at 643 (footnotes omitted)). Here, Appellant did not raise any double jeopardy\nobjections prior to the jury receiving the charge. However, the double jeopardy violation is clear on the\nface of the record as there was only one victim, and therefore only one allowable unit of prosecution. See\nEx parte Cavazos, 203 S.W.3d 333, 336\u201337 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (citing Ex parte Rathmell, 717 S.W.2d\n33, 36 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)). There is no allegation that Appellant cannot raise his double jeopardy\nclaim for the first time on appeal; instead, the State agrees that the felony murder conviction should be\nvacated. Thus, there is no legitimate state interest served to prevent the issue being raised on appeal.\nAccordingly, Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy issue may be raised for the first time on appeal.\n                                                     5\n\f      To determine whether there are multiple convictions for the same offense, we\nfirst apply the \u201csame elements\u201d test laid out in Blockburger. Bien v. State, 550\nS.W.3d 180, 184 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018). Under the Blockburger test, \u201ctwo offenses\nare not the same if each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d\nId. (citing Blockburger v. U.S., 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932)). In Texas, we look to the\npleadings and relevant statutory provisions\u2014not to the evidence presented at trial\u2014\nto inform this test. Nawaz v. State, 663 S.W.3d 739, 744 (Tex. Crim. App. 2022);\nBien, 550 S.W.3d at 184. If the two offenses have the same elements, a judicial\npresumption arises that the offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy.\nBien, 550 S.W.3d at 184. This presumption can be rebutted by a clearly expressed\nlegislative intent to create two separate offenses. Id. If, however, the two offenses\ndo not have the same elements, the judicial presumption is that the offenses are\ndifferent for double jeopardy purposes and multiple punishments are permitted. Id.\nat 185. This presumption can be rebutted if it is clear the legislature intended that\nonly one punishment be assessed. Id.\n      The legislature also decides whether a particular course of conduct involves\none or more distinct offenses under a given statute. Id. The Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals has considered the statute governing murder and determined that \u201cvariants\nof murder contained within the same statutory section are the same offense for\ndouble jeopardy purposes when the same victim is involved.\u201d Ervin v. State, 991\nS.W.2d 804, 807, 815 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).           Thus, the allowable unit of\nprosecution for homicide is based on the number of victims involved. Cavazos, 203\nS.W.3d at 336\u201337 (citing Ex parte Rathmell, 717 S.W.2d 33, 36 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1986)). Here, we have two convictions for two variants of murder and only one\nvictim. Thus, although murder and felony murder are distinct offenses under the\nBlockburger test, because there is only one victim, Appellant\u2019s convictions violate\n\n\n                                          6\n\fthe Double Jeopardy Clause. See Ervin, 991 S.W.2d at 807; Barnes v. State, 665\nS.W.3d 192, 201\u201302 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2023, no pet.).\n      When multiple convictions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, we retain the\nconviction for the \u201cmost serious\u201d offense and set aside the others. Bien, 550 S.W.3d\nat 188; Cavazos, 203 S.W.3d at 337 (citing Landers v. State, 957 S.W.2d 558, 559\u2013\n60 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)). \u201cThe most serious offense is the offense of conviction\nfor which the greatest sentence was assessed.\u201d Bien, 550 S.W.3d at 188 (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (citing Cavazos, 203 S.W.3d at 338). In Bien, the Court\nof Criminal Appeals additionally held that if there was a \u201cpractical impossibility\u201d of\ndetermining which offense was most serious, the prosecutor should have some\ndiscretion in determining which conviction to retain. Id. at 188\u201389.\n      2. Analysis\n      Appellant was convicted of murder and felony murder. Both are first-degree\nfelony offenses and carry the same punishment range. PENAL \u00a7 19.02(c), \u00a7 12.32\n(West 2019). The jury assessed\u2014and the trial court imposed\u2014different sentences\nfor each conviction. For the murder conviction, the jury assessed punishment at\nconfinement for sixty-five years and for the felony murder conviction, the jury\nassessed punishment at confinement for fifty years.          Therefore, the murder\nconviction is the \u201cmost serious offense\u201d since the sentence assessed for that\nconviction was the greatest.\n      Appellant\u2019s first issue is sustained. We vacate the conviction for felony\nmurder along with the corresponding punishment.\n      Issue Two: There is Sufficient Evidence Supporting the Murder Conviction\n      In Appellant\u2019s second issue, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to\nsupport any of his three convictions. As we have vacated the conviction for felony\nmurder under the Double Jeopardy Clause, we are only left with the issue of\nsufficiency as to the convictions for murder and engaging in organized criminal\n                                          7\n\factivity. However, for whatever reason, Appellant limits the argument portion of\nhis brief to the sufficiency of evidence as to the murder charge only. Specifically,\nAppellant argues on appeal that the State failed to establish beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that he was the person who shot White, as alleged in Count One (murder) of\nthe reindictment and as the trial court charged the jury. Accordingly, we limit our\nanalysis to a sufficiency review for the murder conviction.3\n        1. Standard of Review\n        We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, under the standard\nof review set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Brooks v. State, 323\nS.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Polk v. State, 337 S.W.3d 286, 288\u221289\n(Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2010, pet. ref\u2019d). Under the Jackson standard, we review all\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charged offense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Zuniga v. State, 551 S.W.3d\n729, 732 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018); Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 895; Isassi v. State, 330\nS.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n        Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict requires that\nwe consider all the evidence admitted at trial, including improperly admitted\nevidence. Winfrey v. State, 393 S.W.3d 763, 767 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); Clayton v.\nState, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). As such, we defer to the\nfactfinder\u2019s credibility and weight determinations because the factfinder is the sole\n\n\n\n        3\n          See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1 (\u201cThe court of appeals must hand down a written opinion that is as brief\nas practicable . . . and necessary to final disposition of the appeal.\u201d). Although Appellant\u2019s heading for his\nsecond issue appears to include a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence for all three convictions,\nsubstantively, the argument focuses only on the murder conviction. We decline to make Appellant\u2019s\narguments for him and proceed only on the arguments he presented and briefed: whether there was\ninsufficient evidence to support that Appellant was the shooter for the murder conviction. Arevalo v. State,\n675 S.W.3d 833, 845 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2023, no pet.) (citing TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); see also Ybarra v.\nState, 621 S.W.3d 371, 379 n.3 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland, 2021, pet. ref\u2019d)).\n                                                      8\n\fjudge of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and the weight their testimony is to be afforded.\nWinfrey, 393 S.W.3d at 768; Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 899. The Jackson standard is\ndeferential and accounts for the factfinder\u2019s duty to resolve conflicts in the\ntestimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from the facts.\nJackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Zuniga, 551 S.W.3d at 732; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778.\nWe may not reevaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence to substitute our\njudgment for that of the factfinder. Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1999). Instead, we determine whether the necessary inferences are based\non the combined and cumulative force of all the evidence when viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict. Clement v. State, 248 S.W.3d 791, 796 (Tex. App.\u2014\nFort Worth 2008, no pet.). Therefore, if the record supports conflicting inferences,\nwe presume that the factfinder resolved the conflicts in favor of the verdict, and we\ndefer to that determination. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326; Merritt v. State, 368 S.W.3d\n516, 525\u221226 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778.\n      Further, we treat direct and circumstantial evidence equally under this\nstandard. Isassi, 330 S.W.3d at 638; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778; Hooper v. State,\n214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). It is not necessary that the evidence\ndirectly prove the defendant\u2019s guilt; circumstantial evidence is as probative as direct\nevidence in establishing a defendant\u2019s guilt, and circumstantial evidence can alone\nbe sufficient to establish guilt. Carrizales v. State, 414 S.W.3d 737, 742 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2013) (citing Hooper, 214 S.W.3d at 13). Therefore, in evaluating the\nsufficiency of the evidence, we must consider the cumulative force of all the\nevidence. Villa v. State, 514 S.W.3d 227, 232 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); Murray v.\nState, 457 S.W.3d 446, 448 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). Each fact need not point\ndirectly and independently to guilt if the cumulative force of all incriminating\ncircumstances is sufficient to support the conviction. Hooper, 214 S.W.3d at 13.\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Finally, we measure the legal sufficiency of the evidence by the\nelements of the offense as defined by the hypothetically correct jury charge for the\ncase. Morgan v. State, 501 S.W.3d 84, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016); see also Malik v.\nState, 953 S.W.2d 234, 240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). The hypothetically correct jury\ncharge \u201caccurately sets out the law, is authorized by the indictment, does not\nunnecessarily increase the State\u2019s burden of proof or unnecessarily restrict the\nState\u2019s theories of liability, and adequately describes the particular offense for which\nthe defendant was tried.\u201d Malik, 953 S.W.2d at 240.\n      2. Applicable Law and Analysis\n      As charged in Count One of the indictment, a person commits the offense of\nmurder if he \u201cintentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual\u201d or the\nperson \u201cintends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous\nto human life that causes the death of an individual.\u201d See PENAL \u00a7 19.02(b)(1), (2).\nThese two methods of murder are not separate offenses but are, instead, alternative\nmethods of committing the same offense. Walter v. State, 581 S.W.3d 957, 968\n(Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2019, pet. ref\u2019d). Following a trial, the jury found Appellant\nguilty as charged in Count One of the indictment, in which the State alleged that\nAppellant committed murder as described in Sections 19.02(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the\nTexas Penal Code by shooting White with a firearm.\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\nconclude that the jury could reasonably infer that Appellant intentionally or\nknowingly caused White\u2019s death by shooting him with a firearm, or that he intended\nto cause White serious bodily injury and committed an act clearly dangerous to\nhuman life by shooting him with a firearm, causing his death as alleged in the\nreindictment.\n      The medical examiner (ME) testified that the manner of White\u2019s death was\nhomicide, caused by gunshot wounds to the head. The ME also testified that the\n                                          10\n\fwounds were \u201cintermediate range wounds,\u201d meaning that the approximate distance\nbetween the barrel of the gun and the victim\u2019s skin was within one to a few feet. The\nwounds were from the right to the left side of the victim\u2019s body, signifying that the\nshooter had to be on the right side of the victim when the shots were fired. Sergeant\nCaid testified that the shell casings found at the scene were consistent with\nAppellant\u2019s course of direction as he approached the victim.\n      The jury also heard testimony that an eyewitness saw Appellant shoot White.\nThat, along with the video evidence of Appellant\u2019s close proximity to White at the\napproximate time the four gunshots were heard, the testimony that Appellant was\nknown to carry a firearm in his waistband, and the testimony that Appellant\napproached White with raised arms after White seemingly accessed his firearm, all\ntend to support the jury verdict. The jury could reasonably conclude that Appellant\nintended to shoot White, that he did shoot White, and that the gunshot wounds\ninflicted by Appellant caused White\u2019s death. The evidence is sufficient to support\nthe conviction of murder, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n      Issue Three: The Trial Court did not Abuse its Discretion by Denying the\n      Amended Motion for New Trial\n      In Appellant\u2019s third issue on appeal, he challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of\nhis amended motion for new trial. Appellant argues that because the State withheld\nevidence in violation of Brady4 and Article 39.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedure, the trial court erred when it denied the motion. The evidence complained\nof by Appellant was that, at the time of trial, the lead prosecutor for the State was in\na long-term relationship with a detective who participated in the case investigation\nand who testified at trial.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n                                               11\n\f      1. Standard of Review\n      We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial under\nan abuse of discretion standard. State v. Herndon, 215 S.W.3d 901, 906\u201307 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2007). \u201cA trial judge does not have authority to grant a new trial unless\nthe first proceeding was not in accordance with the law.\u201d Id. at 907. An abuse of\ndiscretion occurs if the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or\nprinciples. State v. Thomas, 428 S.W.3d 99, 103 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (citing\nHerndon, 215 S.W.3d at 907). \u201cThe mere fact that a trial court may decide a matter\ndifferently from an appellate court does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.\nat 103\u201304. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s\nruling and defer to the trial court for credibility determinations and reasonable fact\nfindings which support the ruling. Id. at 104. Rule 21.3 of the Texas Rules of\nAppellate Procedure provides a list of legal grounds on which the trial court must\ngrant a new trial. TEX. R. APP. P. 21.3; see Herndon, 215 S.W.3d at 907. The list is\nnot exhaustive, and the trial court may grant a new trial on other legal grounds.\nHerndon, 215 S.W.3d at 907.\n      2. Applicable Law and Analysis\n      The Supreme Court in Brady v. Maryland held that \u201cthe suppression by the\nprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\u201d regardless of the good or bad\nfaith intent of the prosecution. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. This rule was intended to\navoid unfair trials for those accused of crimes. Pena v. State, 353 S.W.3d 797, 809\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011) (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 86\u201388). Brady essentially created\na federal constitutional right to certain minimal discovery: that which is favorable to\nthe accused and is material to either guilt or punishment. See U.S. v. Bagley, 473\nU.S. 667, 674\u201376 (1985). The duty to disclose evidence is applicable even without\na request from a defendant and it encompasses both impeachment and exculpatory\n                                          12\n\fevidence. Harm v. State, 183 S.W.3d 403, 406 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (citing\nBagley, 473 U.S. 667; U.S. v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976)).\n      Under Brady, the defendant bears the burden of showing that, in light of all\nthe evidence, it is reasonably probable that the outcome of the trial would have been\ndifferent had the prosecution made a timely disclosure of the evidence at issue.\nHampton v. State, 86 S.W.3d 603, 612 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Thus, to find\nreversible error under Brady, a defendant must show that:\n          1) the State failed to disclose evidence, regardless of the prosecution\u2019s\n             good or bad faith;\n          2) the withheld evidence is favorable to him;\n          3) the evidence is material, that is, there is a reasonable probability that\n             had the evidence been disclosed, the outcome of the trial would have\n             been different.\nWebb v. State, 232 S.W.3d 109, 114 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing Hampton, 86\nS.W.3d at 612). Merely showing that the undisclosed information could have\npossibly helped the defense or may have affected the outcome of the trial is not\nenough to establish materiality in the constitutional sense. Id. at 115.\n      \u201cDetermining whether particular evidence was \u2018material\u2019 as part of a claimed\nBrady violation is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d Diamond v. State, 613 S.W.3d\n536, 545 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020) (citing Ex parte Weinstein, 421 S.W.3d 656, 664\nn.17 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)); see also Summers v. Dretke, 431 F.3d 861, 878 (5th\nCir. 2005) (\u201cWhether evidence is material under Brady is a mixed question of law\nand fact.\u201d); U.S. v. Sipe, 388 F. 3d 471, 479 (5th Cir. 2004) (\u201cWhereas we typically\nanalyze legal issues de novo, a Brady determination is inevitably a contextual\ninquiry, involving questions of both law and fact.\u201d); U.S. v. Severns, 559 F.3d 274,\n278 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[W]here the motion for a new trial is based on an alleged Brady\nviolation, the Brady determination is \u2018inevitably a contextual inquiry, involving\nquestions of both law and fact.\u2019\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[w]hile we examine the Brady\n                                          13\n\fquestion de novo, \u2018we must proceed with deference to the factual findings\nunderlying the district court\u2019s decision.\u2019\u201d Severns, 559 F.3d at 278; see also\nHorne v. State, 554 S.W.3d 809, 813 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2018, pet. ref\u2019d).\n      In Appellant\u2019s amended motion for new trial, he claims that the personal\nrelationship between the lead prosecutor and a testifying witness for the State is not\nonly relevant but should have been disclosed under both Brady and Article 39.14.\nAccording to the motion, the personal relationship was significant for impeachment\npurposes, and Appellant had the right to cross examine the testifying witness for his\npurported bias, interest, and motives for testifying. See Hammer v. State, 296\nS.W.3d 555, 563 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). We agree.\n      However, to find reversible error due to the failure to disclose, Appellant\nneeded to show three things to establish a violation of Brady: (1) that the State\nsuppressed the evidence, (2) that the suppressed evidence is favorable to the\ndefendant, and (3) that the suppressed evidence is material. See Webb, 232 S.W.3d\nat 114 (citing Hampton, 86 S.W.3d at 612). Incorporated into the third prong is the\nrequirement that the defendant be prejudiced by the failure to disclose the favorable\nevidence. Harm, 183 S.W.3d at 406. In this case, it is clear that the State should\nhave disclosed information about the lead prosecutor\u2019s relationship with a detective\ninvolved in the investigation who was also a testifying witness for the State. See\nPeek v. State, 494 S.W.3d 156, 164\u201365 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2015, pet. ref\u2019d)\n(Impeachment evidence is tied to an accused\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights and\n\u201c[t]he accused should be allowed great latitude to show a witness\u2019s bias, prejudice,\nor motives to testify falsely.\u201d). The admission of the relationship is favorable\nevidence insofar as it is relevant impeachment evidence. See Diamond, 613 S.W.3d\nat 545 (where favorable evidence includes impeachment evidence). However, the\nnondisclosure of favorable evidence is only a violation of due process if that\nevidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d to guilt or punishment, and evidence is only material if it is\n                                         14\n\freasonably probable that if it had been disclosed it would have impacted the outcome\nof trial. Id. at 546.\n        Viewing the evidence presented at the motion-for-new-trial hearing in the\nlight most favorable to the ruling, we hold that the trial court did not err when it\nconcluded that the evidence was not material, and that a new trial was not warranted.\nSee Thomas, 428 S.W.3d at 104. During the hearing on the motion, Appellant\u2019s trial\ncounsel testified that he would not have done anything differently had the\nrelationship been disclosed prior to trial. Counsel testified that the subject of the\nwitness\u2019 testimony \u201ccould not have [been] manipulated,\u201d was not \u201coverly relevant\nin the totality of circumstances,\u201d and that the theory of the case was related to the\nintegrity of the crime scene\u2014actions occurring prior to the witness arriving at the\ncrime scene.\n        Even on appeal, Appellant admits that no one knows what impact this\nimpeachment evidence would have had on the jury. The mere possibility that the\nevidence may have affected the outcome of the trial is not enough to establish\nmateriality in the constitutional sense. Webb, 232 S.W.3d at 115. Without a showing\nof prejudice, there is no evidence of a violation of Brady or Article 39.14 that\nrequires reversal. Therefore, we cannot say the trial court acted without reference to\nany guiding principles when it denied the amended motion for new trial, or that the\ndenial was an abuse of discretion. See Thomas, 428 S.W.3d at 103 (citing to\nHerndon, 215 S.W.3d at 907). We overrule Appellant\u2019s third issue. 5\n\n\n        5\n         We note that the State, at the motion-for-new-trial hearing and in its brief on appeal, characterizes\ninformation about the relationship between the lead prosecutor and the testifying detective as \u201cnewly\ndiscovered evidence.\u201d See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 40.001 (West 2018). The State argues that\nAppellant was required to satisfy the four-prong test required to obtain relief under Article 40.001 but failed\nto do so. See State v. Arizmendi, 519 S.W.3d 143, 149 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (citing Carsner v. State,\n444 S.W.3d 1, 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). Appellant does not claim error under this theory. In any event,\nthe State\u2019s newly-discovered-evidence argument would not and does not alter our decision to overrule\nAppellant\u2019s third issue.\n\n                                                      15\n\f        Issue Four: The Admission of Tattoo Photos was not an Abuse of Discretion\n        In Appellant\u2019s fourth issue on appeal, he alleges that the trial court\nerroneously admitted State\u2019s Exhibit Nos. 87, 89, and 90.6                            The images are\nphotographs of George\u2019s tattoos. Appellant objected on relevance grounds and\nadditionally alleged that the images were more prejudicial than probative. The trial\ncourt overruled the objection and admitted all four photographs into evidence.\n        1. Standard of Review\n        A trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an\nabuse of discretion standard. Johnson v. State, 490 S.W.3d 895, 908 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2016). A trial court abuses its discretion when it goes outside the zone of\nreasonable disagreement.            Id.    If the trial court\u2019s ruling is correct under any\napplicable theory of law, we will not disturb the ruling, even if the stated reason for\nthe ruling is wrong or insufficient. Id. In order to complain that the trial court erred\nwhen it admitted or excluded evidence, the complaining party must obtain an\nadverse ruling from the trial court, or must object to the court\u2019s refusal to rule.\nOtherwise, the complaining party has not preserved error. Moff v. State, 131 S.W.3d\n485, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n        2. Applicable Law and Analysis\n        Appellant objected to the complained-of photographs; therefore, the issue was\npreserved for appellate review. The photographs of George\u2019s tattoos were offered\nto show Appellant\u2019s association with a gang. The State argued at trial that George\u2019s\npresence at the crime scene makes his relationship with Appellant relevant, and that\nthat association was pertinent evidence for Count Three of the indictment\u2014engaging\n\n\n        6\n         Appellant claims that he is appealing the admission of State\u2019s Exhibit Nos. 86 through 90;\nhowever, there is no Exhibit No. 88 in evidence, and it was not offered at the time of the objection.\nAdditionally, although Appellant initially objected to Exhibit No. 86, Appellant later declined to renew his\nobjection to Exhibit No. 86\u2014saying \u201cthe jury can consider the relevance of it\u201d\u2014after the State\u2019s witness\nindicated it was not a photo of a gang-related tattoo.\n                                                    16\n\fin organized criminal activity. Appellant argues on appeal that the evidence of\nGeorge\u2019s gang-related tattoos was not relevant to the case against Appellant. In this\nregard, Appellant claims that the question before the jury was solely related to\nwhether he was the person who shot and killed White, and as such, the photos of\ntattoos were not relevant. This fails to address the State\u2019s given reason for offering\nthe photographs during the trial: that the photographs tended to show that\nAppellant\u2019s tattoos were similar to George\u2019s, and thus would be some evidence of\nhis association with a gang, as required in Count Three. See Phillips v. State, 534\nS.W.3d 644, 657\u201358 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2017, no pet.) (photos of gang\ntattoos admitted were relevant particularly in conjunction with expert testimony\nregarding gang connection of defendant). See also Washington v. State, 485 S.W.3d\n633, 639 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, no pet.).\n       Gang Intelligence Officer Berry testified that Appellant admitted to being a\nmember of the Crips. Officer Berry also testified that George was identified as being\ninvolved with the Crips. Both Appellant and George had tattoos related to the Crips.\nAn element of engaging in organized criminal activity, requires a probable cause\nshowing that a defendant intended to establish, maintain, or participate in either a\ncombination or a criminal street gang. Barrera v. State, 321 S.W.3d 137, 152 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014San Antonio 2010, pet. ref\u2019d). The display of tattoos or other symbols is\nrelevant in establishing gang membership. Id. at 153 (citing Garza v. State, 213\nS.W.3d 338, 347 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). Because one of the elements of engaging\nin organized criminal activity would require membership in a criminal street gang,\nwe cannot say this is outside the zone of reasonable disagreement to admit evidence\nrelevant to that determination. See PENAL \u00a7\u00a7 71.02(a), 71.01(d). We overrule\nAppellant\u2019s fourth issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                                         This Court\u2019s Ruling\n        We vacate Appellant\u2019s felony murder conviction under Count Two because it\nviolates the Double Jeopardy Clause. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the\ntrial court as to Count Two and render a judgment of acquittal as to that count. See\nSaenz v. State, 131 S.W.3d 43, 53 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2003), aff\u2019d, 166\nS.W.3d 270 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Having overruled Appellant\u2019s remaining\nissues, we affirm the judgments of the trial court as to Count One and Count Three.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           W.

PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 19.02, 71.02 (West Supp. 2023). The\njury then assessed punishment at confinement in the Correctional Institutions\n\n\n      1\n       Appellant was originally indicted in 2018 and then reindicted in 2021.\n\fDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for a term of sixty-five years,\nfifty years, and twenty years, respectively. The trial court sentenced Appellant in\naccordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and ordered that the sentences were to run\nconcurrently.\n      Appellant raises four issues on appeal. First, he argues that his convictions\nfor murder and felony murder violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution\nof the United States. Second, he maintains that the evidence is insufficient to support\nhis convictions for murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal\nactivity. In his third issue on appeal, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when\nit denied Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. And in his fourth issue on appeal,\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of gang\ntattoos that did not belong to Appellant. We affirm in part and vacate in part.\n                           Factual and Procedural History\n      At approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 13, 2018, Odessa Police Department\n(OPD) Officer Brandon Teneyck responded to a call about a gunshot victim; the\nshooting occurred outside an Odessa convenience store. When Officer Teneyck\narrived at the scene, he determined that the shooting victim, Treginale White, was\nstill breathing. Officer Teneyck attempted to provide first aid, to secure the scene\nof the crime, and to give information to dispatch about the chaotic scene. Shortly\nafter Officer Teneyck arrived, an ambulance arrived as well. White did not survive\nhis gunshot wounds and his death was ruled a homicide.\n      OPD Sergeant Justin Caid testified that at the time of the investigation, he was\na detective in the robbery/homicide unit of the Criminal Investigation Division\n(CID). Sergeant Caid arrived on the scene at approximately 3:15 a.m. and began his\ninvestigation into the shooting. Sergeant Caid detected the presence of blood where\nWhite had been lying before emergency medical personnel transported him for\nmedical treatment. An inspection of the area also revealed that there were bullet\n                                           2\n\fdefects in a maroon Cadillac that was associated with White, discharged cartridge\ncasings from a .40 caliber firearm, and pieces of projectile jacketing. Sergeant Caid\nconducted interviews with multiple witnesses at the scene. One witness\u2014who came\nforward after the shooting\u2014testified that he heard four gunshots and that he saw\nAppellant shoot White.\n      Sergeant Caid obtained surveillance footage recorded from inside the\nconvenience store. The video contained footage from two different angles: one\nfocused closer to the cash register, but with a view of the front door and just outside\nof the front of the store, and one with a wider view of the store that shows the front\nwindows and the outside of the front of the store. An OPD officer with CID edited\nthe footage so that the videos appeared as one. The jury saw the footage. The jury\nalso saw other versions of the same video; some in slow motion and others that\nhighlighted Appellant.\n      The video shows that as Appellant was standing in line at the cash register, a\nman later identified as Christopher George entered the store and caught Appellant\u2019s\nattention. Appellant and George then ran out the door. As Appellant ran out the\ndoor, he raised his arms and ran toward White.\n      Officer Caid testified that the surveillance footage showed that Appellant was\nputting pressure on his right side as he was running out of the convenience store.\nAccording to Officer Caid, that was a common action if an unretained (unholstered)\nweapon is tucked in a waistband.        Appellant\u2019s former girlfriend testified that\nAppellant is right-handed, and that he frequently carried a firearm in his waistband.\n      As Appellant, with his arms raised, went toward White, four gunshots rang\nout and White fell to the ground; Appellant ran away.\n      Law enforcement personnel determined that Appellant was the one who had\nshot and killed White, Officers later apprehended Appellant in California.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      The State presented evidence of Appellant\u2019s gang affiliation.             Gang\nIntelligence Officer Jeremy Berry testified that, although Appellant was not\nimmediately identified as being involved in a gang, Appellant later admitted that he\nwas a member of the Rollin 60s Crips (Crips). Officer Berry also testified that\nGeorge was identified as being involved with the Crips. Over Appellant\u2019s objection,\nthe trial court admitted evidence pertaining to George\u2019s tattoos. The tattoos\npurportedly showed his affiliation with the Crips. Both Appellant and George had\ntattoos related to the Crips. The trial court also admitted photographs of Appellant\u2019s\ntattoos into evidence. The jury also heard testimony that White was a Blood gang\nmember and was on parole at the time of his death for the murder of a Crips gang\nmember.\n      As we have said, following the close of evidence, the jury found Appellant\nguilty of the offenses of murder, felony murder, and engaging in organized criminal\nactivity. Appellant timely filed a motion for new trial, wherein he alleged two\ncomplaints: (1) that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and \u201cdid not meet the\nrelevant standard required for conviction\u201d, and (2) that Appellant was convicted for\ntwo offenses of the same conduct (murder and felony murder). Appellant later\namended the motion for new trial to include an allegation that the State failed to\ndisclose exculpatory and material evidence: the State\u2019s lead prosecutor and OPD\nDetective Trent Autrey were in a long-term relationship with one another. The trial\ncourt conducted a hearing on the motion for new trial and denied it.\n      Issue One: A Violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause Occurred\n      In Appellant\u2019s first issue, he claims that his convictions for murder and felony\nmurder violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution of the United States.\nBoth convictions are related to the murder of the same victim: Treginale White.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fAppellant and the State both contend that the proper remedy is to vacate the felony\nmurder conviction.2 We agree.\n        1.

V.\nThe United States Supreme Court has concluded that the Fifth Amendment offers\nthree separate constitutional protections: (1) protection against a second prosecution\nfor the same offense after acquittal; (2) protection against a second prosecution for\nthe same offense after conviction; and (3) protection against multiple punishments\nfor the same offense.

The jury assessed\u2014and the trial court imposed\u2014different sentences\nfor each conviction. For the murder conviction, the jury assessed punishment at\nconfinement for sixty-five years and for the felony murder conviction, the jury\nassessed punishment at confinement for fifty years.          Therefore, the murder\nconviction is the \u201cmost serious offense\u201d since the sentence assessed for that\nconviction was the greatest.\n      Appellant\u2019s first issue is sustained. We vacate the conviction for felony\nmurder along with the corresponding punishment.\n      Issue Two: There is Sufficient Evidence Supporting the Murder Conviction\n      In Appellant\u2019s second issue, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to\nsupport any of his three convictions. As we have vacated the conviction for felony\nmurder under the Double Jeopardy Clause, we are only left with the issue of\nsufficiency as to the convictions for murder and engaging in organized criminal\n                                          7\n\factivity. However, for whatever reason, Appellant limits the argument portion of\nhis brief to the sufficiency of evidence as to the murder charge only. Specifically,\nAppellant argues on appeal that the State failed to establish beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that he was the person who shot White, as alleged in Count One (murder) of\nthe reindictment and as the trial court charged the jury. Accordingly, we limit our\nanalysis to a sufficiency review for the murder conviction.3\n        1.

Applicable Law and Analysis\n      As charged in Count One of the indictment, a person commits the offense of\nmurder if he \u201cintentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual\u201d or the\nperson \u201cintends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous\nto human life that causes the death of an individual.\u201d See PENAL \u00a7 19.02(b)(1), (2).\nThese two methods of murder are not separate offenses but are, instead, alternative\nmethods of committing the same offense. Walter v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">581 S.W.3d 957</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 968\n(Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2019, pet. ref\u2019d). Following a trial, the jury found Appellant\nguilty as charged in Count One of the indictment, in which the State alleged that\nAppellant committed murder as described in Sections 19.02(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the\nTexas Penal Code by shooting White with a firearm.\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\nconclude that the jury could reasonably infer that Appellant intentionally or\nknowingly caused White\u2019s death by shooting him with a firearm, or that he intended\nto cause White serious bodily injury and committed an act clearly dangerous to\nhuman life by shooting him with a firearm, causing his death as alleged in the\nreindictment.\n      The medical examiner (ME) testified that the manner of White\u2019s death was\nhomicide, caused by gunshot wounds to the head. The ME also testified that the\n                                          10\n\fwounds were \u201cintermediate range wounds,\u201d meaning that the approximate distance\nbetween the barrel of the gun and the victim\u2019s skin was within one to a few feet. The\nwounds were from the right to the left side of the victim\u2019s body, signifying that the\nshooter had to be on the right side of the victim when the shots were fired. Sergeant\nCaid testified that the shell casings found at the scene were consistent with\nAppellant\u2019s course of direction as he approached the victim.\n      The jury also heard testimony that an eyewitness saw Appellant shoot White.\nThat, along with the video evidence of Appellant\u2019s close proximity to White at the\napproximate time the four gunshots were heard, the testimony that Appellant was\nknown to carry a firearm in his waistband, and the testimony that Appellant\napproached White with raised arms after White seemingly accessed his firearm, all\ntend to support the jury verdict. The jury could reasonably conclude that Appellant\nintended to shoot White, that he did shoot White, and that the gunshot wounds\ninflicted by Appellant caused White\u2019s death. The evidence is sufficient to support\nthe conviction of murder, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n      Issue Three: The Trial Court did not Abuse its Discretion by Denying the\n      Amended Motion for New Trial\n      In Appellant\u2019s third issue on appeal, he challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of\nhis amended motion for new trial. Appellant argues that because the State withheld\nevidence in violation of Brady4 and Article 39.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedure, the trial court erred when it denied the motion. The evidence complained\nof by Appellant was that, at the time of trial, the lead prosecutor for the State was in\na long-term relationship with a detective who participated in the case investigation\nand who testified at trial.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       See Brady v.

We agree.\n      However, to find reversible error due to the failure to disclose, Appellant\nneeded to show three things to establish a violation of Brady: (1) that the State\nsuppressed the evidence, (2) that the suppressed evidence is favorable to the\ndefendant, and (3) that the suppressed evidence is material.

The admission of the relationship is favorable\nevidence insofar as it is relevant impeachment evidence. See Diamond, 613 S.W.3d\nat 545 (where favorable evidence includes impeachment evidence).

The photographs of George\u2019s tattoos were offered\nto show Appellant\u2019s association with a gang.

In this\nregard, Appellant claims that the question before the jury was solely related to\nwhether he was the person who shot and killed White, and as such, the photos of\ntattoos were not relevant. This fails to address the State\u2019s given reason for offering\nthe photographs during the trial: that the photographs tended to show that\nAppellant\u2019s tattoos were similar to George\u2019s, and thus would be some evidence of\nhis association with a gang, as required in Count Three.

On\nOctober 24, 2022, the trial court held a hearing on the application, during which the\nState presented evidence, and Appellant testified that the allegations were \u201c[p]artly\u201d\ntrue.

Six Unknown\n\n         _____________________\n         *\n             This opinion is not designated for publication. See 5th Cir. R. 47.5.\n\fCase: 22-50583      Document: 00517038578            Page: 2    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 22-50583\n\n\n   Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). The motion is\n   a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in\n   good faith. See Baugh v. Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997).\n          The district court dismissed Steele\u2019s claims against the United States\n   Postal Service (USPS), the United States, and the State of Texas after\n   determining that the defendants were immune from suit. Steele maintains\n   that the USPS is no longer a governmental entity and thus does not warrant\n   sovereign immunity. He is incorrect. See Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 U.S.\n   481, 484 (2006). The fact that he is alleging federal question jurisdiction\n   against the USPS and the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 does\n   not preclude sovereign immunity in the absence of a statute waiving such\n   immunity. Elldakli v. Garland, 64 F.4th 666, 670 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\n   No. 23-115, 2023 WL 8531894 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2023).               Although Steele\n   correctly asserts that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Administrative\n   Procedures Act may waive sovereign immunity in certain situations, those\n   are not applicable here. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704; McAfee v. 5th Cir. Judges, 884\n   F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir. 1989).          Steele\u2019s assertion that the Eleventh\n   Amendment does not bar lawsuits against the State of Texas because he was\n   alleging that the defendant was acting contrary to federal law is incorrect. See\n   Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 339-40 (1979).\n          With respect to the individual defendants, officials with the Texas\n   Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), Steele does not challenge the\n   district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against them in their official capacities,\n   and any such arguments are deemed abandoned. See Brinkmann v. Dallas\n   Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, 813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). As for the\n   claims against these defendants in their individual capacities, Steele contends\n   that they have violated his rights of access to the courts under the First and\n   Fourteenth Amendments because the USPS is the only authorized service to\n   be used by TDCJ prisoners to send legal mail to the courts. He maintains\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fCase: 22-50583     Document: 00517038578           Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-50583\n\n\n   that undue delays in the postal system and the existence of third-party\n   delivery services requires that prisoners be permitted to use another means\n   of delivering legal mail. Steele has not shown that exclusive use of the USPS\n   precludes prisoners from having a reasonably adequate opportunity to\n   challenge their convictions or the conditions of their confinement. See Lewis\n   v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 354-55 (1996). Moreover, Steele has not sufficiently\n   alleged that he was unable to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim in light of\n   delays in the mail system. See Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415\n   (2002).\n          Finally, Steele alleges that the individual defendants have deprived\n   him of access to the courts under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n   because they have limited prisoners\u2019 access to paper supplies, free postage,\n   the prison law library, and public record information. He concedes that he\n   has access to the prison law library, and he has not shown that limitations on\n   \u201cextra\u201d time or weekend visits were unreasonable or insufficient. See\n   McDonald v. Steward, 132 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir. 1998). Additionally, Steele\n   has not shown that he has a constitutional right to unlimited postage, paper,\n   or public records. See Felix v. Rolan, 833 F.2d 517, 518 (5th Cir. 1987).\n   Moreover, Steele has not sufficiently alleged that the limitations on supplies\n   or library access prevented him from pursuing a nonfrivolous legal claim. See\n   Christopher, 536 U.S. at 415; McDonald, 132 F.3d at 230-31.\n          Steele has not established that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on\n   appeal. See Baugh, 117 F.3d at 202; Howard v. King, 707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th\n   Cir. 1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED,\n   and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. See Baugh, 117 F.3d at 202\n   n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal as frivolous\n   counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). See Adepegba v. Hammons,\n   103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996), abrogated in part on other grounds by\n   Coleman v. Tollefson, 575 U.S. 532 (2015). Steele is CAUTIONED that if\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fCase: 22-50583     Document: 00517038578          Page: 4   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 22-50583\n\n\n   he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in\n   any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any\n   facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.

Steele maintains\n   that the USPS is no longer a governmental entity and thus does not warrant\n   sovereign immunity. He is incorrect. See Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">546 U.S.\n   481</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (2006). The fact that he is alleging federal question jurisdiction\n   against the USPS and the United States pursuant to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331</span><pre class=\"inline\"> does\n   not preclude sovereign immunity in the absence of a statute waiving such\n   immunity.

Although Steele\n   correctly asserts that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Administrative\n   Procedures Act may waive sovereign immunity in certain situations, those\n   are not applicable here. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704</span><pre class=\"inline\">; McAfee v. 5th Cir.

Steele\u2019s assertion that the Eleventh\n   Amendment does not bar lawsuits against the State of Texas because he was\n   alleging that the defendant was acting contrary to federal law is incorrect. See\n   Quern v.

See Brinkmann v. Dallas\n   Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484679\"><a href=\"/opinion/484679/reginald-r-brinkmann-jr-v-dallas-county-deputy-sheriff-abner/\">813 F.2d 744</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). As for the\n   claims against these defendants in their individual capacities, Steele contends\n   that they have violated his rights of access to the courts under the First and\n   Fourteenth Amendments because the USPS is the only authorized service to\n   be used by TDCJ prisoners to send legal mail to the courts. He maintains\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fCase: 22-50583     Document: 00517038578           Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-50583\n\n\n   that undue delays in the postal system and the existence of third-party\n   delivery services requires that prisoners be permitted to use another means\n   of delivering legal mail. Steele has not shown that exclusive use of the USPS\n   precludes prisoners from having a reasonably adequate opportunity to\n   challenge their convictions or the conditions of their confinement. See Lewis\n   v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\">518 U.S. 343</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354-55 (1996). Moreover, Steele has not sufficiently\n   alleged that he was unable to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim in light of\n   delays in the mail system. See Christopher v. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\">536 U.S. 403</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415\n   (2002).\n          Finally, Steele alleges that the individual defendants have deprived\n   him of access to the courts under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n   because they have limited prisoners\u2019 access to paper supplies, free postage,\n   the prison law library, and public record information. He concedes that he\n   has access to the prison law library, and he has not shown that limitations on\n   \u201cextra\u201d time or weekend visits were unreasonable or insufficient. See\n   McDonald v. Steward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749807\"><a href=\"/opinion/749807/willie-ray-mcdonald-v-j-steward-library-supervisor-michael-unit/\">132 F.3d 225</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230 (5th Cir. 1998).

For the\n   reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part.\n                                  I.      Background\n          On the evening of February 16, 2020, Marcus Traylor and three of his\n   friends attended Clutch Bar and Restaurant (\u201cClutch\u201d) in Dallas, Texas. 1\n   That night, Dallas Police Department (\u201cDPD\u201d) Officer Gideon Yorka and\n   another DPD officer were working private security at Clutch. The officers\n   were off duty but wearing their full DPD uniforms.\n          At the bar, Traylor\u2019s group ordered \u201cbottle service,\u201d which included\n   one bottle of champagne and two bottles of hard alcohol. Traylor consumed\n   \u201ctwo or three glasses\u201d of champagne over the course of an hour. At some\n   point, Clutch security asked the group to leave because Traylor\u2019s friend had\n   fallen asleep. When Traylor lingered to pay his tab, a Clutch bouncer grabbed\n   him from behind and brought him to the ground. Yorka was outside during\n   this altercation. However, Clutch security informed him that there had been\n   a fight inside and sought his assistance. Yorka and his colleague then entered\n   the bar to break up the commotion, where Yorka observed Traylor with a\n   bloodied mouth being restrained on the floor by Clutch security. Yorka\n   picked Traylor up by the arm and escorted him out of the bar. During this\n   encounter, Yorka detected the smell of alcohol on Traylor\u2019s breath.\n          The parties\u2019 versions of the events outside of the bar vary\n   significantly. According to Traylor, he cooperated as Yorka escorted him\n   past a crowd outside of the bar and shoved him into the street. Yorka\n\n          _____________________\n          1\n             Because this is an appeal from a summary judgment order, we discuss the\n   following facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Traylor. See Deville v.\n   Marcantel, 567 F.3d 156, 163\u201364 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam). However, we note factual\n   discrepancies where relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516          Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-10783\n\n\n   instructed Traylor to leave, but Traylor told Yorka that his wallet and\n   belongings were still inside Clutch. Yorka, however, remained adamant that\n   Traylor leave immediately. Traylor then walked towards the curb to find\n   assistance from a security guard or another person to help get his wallet. As\n   Traylor approached the curb, Yorka struck him in the face, causing him to\n   fall to the ground.\n          According to Yorka, Traylor was uncooperative as he escorted him\n   outside of the bar. Traylor repeatedly tried to turn around to go back inside,\n   but Yorka was able to regain control and shove Traylor into the street. Once\n   released, Traylor again tried to go back to the bar, saying \u201cthis sh** is not\n   over; this motherf***er started it.\u201d Yorka again pushed Traylor away\n   towards the street. When Traylor continued to make his way back towards\n   the bar, Yorka pushed him a second time. Traylor then used his forearm to\n   shove Yorka in the chest and neck area, creating separation between the two.\n   When Traylor again approached Yorka, Yorka punched him.\n          A bystander recorded a portion of the relevant events. The video\n   shows a crowded scene both inside and outside of the bar. The camera then\n   pans to the left and shows Traylor in a white hoodie standing in the street.\n   Yorka is standing a few feet away facing Traylor. Traylor leans forward and\n   walks in Yorka\u2019s direction. Yorka then punches Traylor in the face, and\n   Traylor falls to the ground. The interaction lasts only a few seconds before\n   the video cuts to the officers helping Yorka and an ambulance arriving.\n          The parties agree on the events after Yorka struck Traylor. An\n   ambulance took Traylor to the hospital. Traylor was then arrested and\n   charged with felony assault against a peace officer. The jail supervisor,\n   however, rejected the charge and reduced it to a class C misdemeanor for\n   offensive contact. Officers issued Traylor a citation and released him that\n   night. The misdemeanor was later dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516          Page: 4    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-10783\n\n\n          On February 25, 2021, Traylor filed this suit against Yorka pursuant\n   to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Traylor alleges that Yorka (1) used excessive force in\n   violation of the Fourth Amendment, (2) unlawfully arrested him in violation\n   of the Fourth Amendment, and (3) fabricated evidence of assault in violation\n   of Traylor\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right. Upon\n   Yorka\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court granted qualified\n   immunity to Yorka on the excessive force and unlawful arrest claims.\n   However, the district court denied qualified immunity on Traylor\u2019s\n   fabrication-of-evidence claim. Both parties timely appealed.\n                   II.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n          The district court properly exercised jurisdiction over Traylor\u2019s\n   federal law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. As to Traylor\u2019s excessive\n   force and unlawful arrest claims, we have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s\n   partial final judgment entered pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n   54(b). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; see also Briargrove Shopping Ctr. Joint Venture v.\n   Pilgrim Enters., 170 F.3d 536, 538\u201339 (5th Cir. 1999). As to Traylor\u2019s\n   substantive due process claim, we have jurisdiction to immediately review\n   the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity. Jason v. Tanner, 938 F.3d\n   191, 194 (5th Cir. 2019).\n          We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment based on\n   qualified immunity de novo. Griggs v. Brewer, 841 F.3d 308, 311 (5th Cir.\n   2016). In conducting this review, we must \u201cview the facts in the light most\n   favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its\n   favor.\u201d Deville v. Marcantel, 567 F.3d 156, 163\u201364 (5th Cir. 2009) (per\n   curiam). Summary judgment is proper where there are no genuine issues of\n   material fact, and the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\n   Alkhawaldeh v. Dow Chem. Co., 851 F.3d 422, 426 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Fed.\n   R. Civ. P. 56(a)).\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fCase: 22-10783        Document: 00517038516               Page: 5    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 22-10783\n\n\n           In qualified immunity cases on interlocutory appeal, we consider only\n   \u201cthe scope of clearly established law and the objective reasonableness of the\n   defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Jason, 938 F.3d at 194 (internal quotation marks and\n   citation omitted). We \u201ccan review the materiality of any factual disputes, but\n   not their genuineness.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). 2\n                                    III.      Discussion\n           Traylor raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether Yorka was entitled to\n   qualified immunity on the excessive force claim; and (2) whether Yorka was\n   entitled to qualified immunity on the unlawful arrest claim. On cross appeal,\n   Yorka raises an additional issue of whether he was entitled to qualified\n   immunity on the fabrication-of-evidence claim. We address each issue in\n   turn.\n       A. Excessive Force\n           Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, private citizens may sue public officials for\n   violations of their constitutional rights. However, \u201c[q]ualified immunity\n   shields from liability \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\n   violate the law.\u2019\u201d Romero v. City of Grapevine, 888 F.3d 170, 176 (5th Cir.\n   2018) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)). To determine\n   whether qualified immunity bars a \u00a7 1983 claim, we ask (1) whether \u201cthe\n   official\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the right\n   was clearly established.\u201d Cunningham v. Castloo, 983 F.3d 185, 190\u201391 (5th\n   Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Traylor\u2019s\n   claim fails at the first inquiry because Yorka\u2019s use of force did not violate\n   Traylor\u2019s Fourth Amendment right.\n\n\n           _____________________\n           2\n             Because the district court entered final judgment on the excessive force and\n   unlawful arrest claims, these limitations apply only to the fabrication-of-evidence claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516           Page: 6    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 22-10783\n\n\n          To prevail on a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, a plaintiff\n   must show that he \u201csuffer[ed] an injury that result[ed] directly and only from\n   a clearly excessive and objectively unreasonable use of force.\u201d Joseph ex. rel.\n   Est. of Joseph v. Bartlett, 981 F.3d 319, 332 (5th Cir. 2020). The district court\n   did not address whether Traylor suffered an injury, but undisputed evidence\n   shows that he suffered a broken wrist from falling after Yorka\u2019s punch. Thus,\n   the only remaining issue is whether Yorka\u2019s use of force was \u201cobjectively\n   unreasonable.\u201d See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989). We look to\n   several factors for this inquiry, including \u201c(1) the severity of the crime at\n   issue, (2) whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of\n   officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest or\n   attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d Joseph, 981 F.3d at 332 (citing Graham,\n   490 U.S. at 396). \u201cThe reasonableness of a particular use of force must be\n   judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than\n   with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d Darden v. City of Fort Worth, 880 F.3d\n   722, 729 (5th Cir. 2018) (quotation omitted).\n          Construing all factual disputes in Traylor\u2019s favor, Yorka\u2019s use of force\n   was not objectively unreasonable. Even under Traylor\u2019s version of events,\n   Yorka could have reasonably believed Traylor posed a threat. Clutch security\n   had just informed Yorka that Traylor had been in a fight, and Yorka observed\n   Traylor bloodied on the floor with a strong scent of alcohol. See Escobar v.\n   Montee, 895 F.3d 387, 394\u201395 (5th Cir. 2018) (considering that an officer had\n   been warned plaintiff was a threat). Most importantly, the video shows\n   Traylor moving quickly towards Yorka. Even accepting Traylor\u2019s version as\n   true, and therefore interpreting his actions as walking towards a third party\n   to ask about retrieving his wallet, the video still supports Yorka\u2019s perception\n   of a threat, which is the key question in such a quick and messy situation.\n   Indeed, Traylor leans forward then walks in Yorka\u2019s direction. Given\n   Traylor\u2019s insistence on retrieving his wallet and the information Yorka\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516           Page: 7    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 22-10783\n\n\n   received about the fight, Yorka could have reasonably interpreted Traylor\u2019s\n   steps as a \u201ccharge\u201d towards him. Further, the video shows that only a couple\n   of seconds spanned between Traylor\u2019s steps towards Yorka and Yorka\u2019s\n   strike. The tense environment and need for a split-second decision indicate\n   that Yorka\u2019s use of force was not unreasonable. See Graham, 490 U.S. at\n   396\u201397 (\u201cThe calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact\n   that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in\n   circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the\n   amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d). In looking back,\n   it is always easy to think of other things that could have been done differently.\n   Yet, although Yorka\u2019s escalation to a strike to the face \u201cmay not have been\n   as restrained as we would like to expect from model police conduct . . .\n   qualified immunity \u2018protect[s] officers from the sometimes hazy border\n   between excessive and acceptable force\u2019\u201d in the moment. Griggs, 841 F.3d\n   at 315 (alterations in original) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 206\n   (2001)).\n          Traylor argues that the district court erred by determining Yorka\n   acted reasonably based on Yorka\u2019s version of events. Traylor claims that,\n   under his version, Yorka would have had no reason to doubt that he was\n   merely attempting to retrieve his wallet.        But Traylor disregards that\n   reasonability \u201cmust be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on\n   the scene.\u201d Darden, 880 F.3d at 729 (quotation omitted). Although Traylor\n   did submit evidence that his intent was to speak to a third party, he has not\n   produced evidence showing that this intent manifested in any outward\n   action. See Cloud v. Stone, 993 F.3d 379, 386 (5th Cir. 2021) (\u201c[W]e measure\n   excessive force by the objective circumstances, not by the subjective\n   intentions of the arrestee.\u201d). Even interpreting the video in Traylor\u2019s favor,\n   it clearly shows him, at the very least, quickly approaching Yorka. Thus, the\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516            Page: 8    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 22-10783\n\n\n   factual dispute of whether Traylor intended to charge at Yorka or speak to a\n   third party is immaterial.\n          Because of the tense situation and Yorka\u2019s need to make a split-second\n   decision, Yorka\u2019s use of force did not violate Traylor\u2019s Fourth Amendment\n   right. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Traylor\u2019s\n   excessive force claim.\n      B. Unlawful Arrest\n          The Fourth Amendment bars unreasonable seizures of both property\n   and people. California v. Hodari, 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991). A seizure is\n   reasonable if it is based on probable cause. Club Retro, L.L.C. v. Hilton, 568\n   F.3d 181, 208 (5th Cir. 2009). Therefore, to defeat qualified immunity on an\n   unlawful arrest claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) probable cause did not exist,\n   and (2) the defendant-official was \u201cobjectively unreasonable in believing\n   there was probable cause for the arrest.\u201d Bey v. Prator, 53 F.4th 854, 858 (5th\n   Cir. 2022) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert.\n   denied, 143 S. Ct. 1783 (2023).\n          Here, the district court found that Yorka had probable cause to arrest\n   Traylor for interference with a police officer\u2019s performance of public duties\n   in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.15. Traylor argues that the district\n   court erred by treating \u00a7 38.15 as a strict liability provision because the statute\n   instead requires a showing of criminal negligence. But Traylor provides no\n   authority requiring a showing of criminal negligence for arrest on suspected\n   violation of \u00a7 38.15.     Indeed, our precedent has not imposed such a\n   requirement. See, e.g., Haggerty v. Tex. S. Univ., 391 F.3d 653, 656\u201357 (5th\n   Cir. 2004) (holding that officer had probable cause for arrest under \u00a7 38.15\n   after plaintiff ignored warnings not to intervene and instead stepped forward\n   towards the officer); Childers v. Iglesias, 848 F.3d 412, 415 (5th Cir. 2017)\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fCase: 22-10783         Document: 00517038516              Page: 9       Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 22-10783\n\n\n   (affirming probable cause for arrest under \u00a7 38.15 where the plaintiff failed to\n   follow an officer\u2019s order to move his truck).\n           Further, uncontested evidence shows that Traylor failed to comply\n   with Yorka\u2019s numerous orders to leave. This instruction was made in\n   Yorka\u2019s duty to maintain the peace at Clutch, as even an off-duty officer has\n   a duty \u201cto preserve the peace within the officer\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Bustos v.\n   Martini Club Inc., 599 F.3d 458, 466 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Tex. Code\n   Crim. Proc. art. 2.13(a)). Thus, Yorka had probable cause to arrest\n   Traylor for interfering with the performance of his public duties. See Buehler\n   v. Dear, 27 F.4th 969, 992 (5th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[R]efusing to obey police\n   officers\u2019 repeated and unambiguous warnings to step back so as not to\n   interfere with officers\u2019 official duties . . . establishes probable cause to arrest\n   for a violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.15(a)(1).\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm\n   the district court\u2019s dismissal of Traylor\u2019s unlawful arrest claim.\n       C. Fabrication of Evidence\n           In Cole v. Carson, we recognized a substantive due process right \u201cnot\n   to have police deliberately fabricate evidence and use it to frame and bring\n   false charges against a person.\u201d 802 F.3d 752, 771 (5th Cir. 2015). 3 Here,\n   Traylor claims that Yorka fabricated evidence of assault by making a false\n   statement that Traylor pushed him. The district court denied qualified\n\n           _____________________\n           3\n             Cole has a complex procedural history. The Supreme Court vacated Cole and\n   remanded for reconsideration in light of its holding in Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7 (2015)\n   (per curiam). Hunter v. Cole, 580 U.S. 994, 994 (2016) (mem.). On remand, we reinstated\n   the Cole opinion regarding the due process fabrication-of-evidence claim because Mullenix\n   did not concern that issue. See Cole v. Carson, 905 F.3d 334, 347 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cCole\n   II\u201d). Cole II was subsequently vacated when we granted rehearing en banc. Cole v. Carson,\n   915 F.3d 378 (5th Cir. 2019). However, the en banc court held that Cole\u2019s fabrication-of-\n   evidence claim remained viable. Cole v. Carson, 935 F.3d 444, 451 (5th Cir. 2019), as revised\n   (Aug. 21, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n                                                     9\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516           Page: 10   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 22-10783\n\n\n   immunity because it concluded this case is similar to Cole and Traylor raised\n   a fact issue as to whether Yorka\u2019s statement was fabricated. However, as\n   discussed above, Traylor must establish both a violation of his constitutional\n   right and that this right was clearly established. See Cunningham, 983 F.3d at\n   190\u201391. We may limit our analysis to the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong if it\n   resolves the qualified immunity issue. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223,\n   236\u201337 (2009). Because Cole did not clearly establish Traylor\u2019s right as\n   relevant here, we conclude that Yorka is entitled to qualified immunity.\n           A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff bears a heavy burden of establishing that an officer\n   violated clearly established law. Morrow v. Meachum, 917 F.3d 870, 874 (5th\n   Cir. 2019). \u201cA right is clearly established only if relevant precedent \u2018ha[s]\n   placed the . . . constitutional question beyond debate.\u2019\u201d Id. (alterations in\n   original) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011)); see also\n   Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cA clearly established\n   right is one that is sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have\n   understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d (internal quotation\n   marks and citation omitted)). Traylor relies solely on Cole, in which we\n   established a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim for\n   fabrication of evidence. But we may not define clearly established law with\n   such a high level of generality. See al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742. Instead, \u201c[t]he\n   dispositive question is \u2018whether the violative nature of particular conduct is\n   clearly established.\u2019\u201d Mullenix, 577 U.S. at 12 (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at\n   742).   Thus, Cole can establish Traylor\u2019s right only if the facts there\n   \u201csquarely govern[]\u201d the specific facts at issue here. See Kisela v. Hughes, 138\n   S. Ct. 1148, 1153 (2018) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). We conclude that\n   they do not.\n           In Cole, three officers pursued the plaintiff and subsequently opened\n   fire. 802 F.3d at 755\u201356. After the shooting, the officers had time to confer\n   before giving their statements, and they ultimately claimed that the plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fCase: 22-10783        Document: 00517038516               Page: 11      Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 22-10783\n\n\n   was given a prior warning and pointed his gun towards one of the officers. Id.\n   at 756. Indeed, Cole involved allegations of a conspiracy and the calculated\n   fabrication of evidence to justify a shooting. 4 See id. This false evidence led\n   to a felony charge for aggravated assault on a public servant, which in turn\n   caused significant reputational injuries and legal expenses. 5 Id. at 756, 766.\n           The facts of Cole are distinguishable from those presented here. This\n   case involves a quick and chaotic incident in which the parties have different\n   versions of events. Traylor has not shown that Yorka had the time or\n   deliberation to fabricate evidence of assault. Further, Traylor did not face\n   the extreme consequences as those of the plaintiff in Cole. Indeed, Traylor\u2019s\n   charge was reduced to a misdemeanor the same night of the incident. Given\n   this significant divergence of facts, Cole did not clearly establish that \u201cevery\n   reasonable official\u201d in Yorka\u2019s position would have understood that his\n   conduct violated Traylor\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right. See Mullenix, 577\n   U.S. at 11 (quotation omitted). Yorka is thus entitled to qualified immunity\n   on Traylor\u2019s fabrication-of-evidence claim.\n                                     IV.

For the\n   reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part.\n                                  I.      Background\n          On the evening of February 16, 2020, Marcus Traylor and three of his\n   friends attended Clutch Bar and Restaurant (\u201cClutch\u201d) in Dallas, Texas. 1\n   That night, Dallas Police Department (\u201cDPD\u201d) Officer Gideon Yorka and\n   another DPD officer were working private security at Clutch. The officers\n   were off duty but wearing their full DPD uniforms.\n          At the bar, Traylor\u2019s group ordered \u201cbottle service,\u201d which included\n   one bottle of champagne and two bottles of hard alcohol. Traylor consumed\n   \u201ctwo or three glasses\u201d of champagne over the course of an hour. At some\n   point, Clutch security asked the group to leave because Traylor\u2019s friend had\n   fallen asleep. When Traylor lingered to pay his tab, a Clutch bouncer grabbed\n   him from behind and brought him to the ground. Yorka was outside during\n   this altercation. However, Clutch security informed him that there had been\n   a fight inside and sought his assistance. Yorka and his colleague then entered\n   the bar to break up the commotion, where Yorka observed Traylor with a\n   bloodied mouth being restrained on the floor by Clutch security. Yorka\n   picked Traylor up by the arm and escorted him out of the bar. During this\n   encounter, Yorka detected the smell of alcohol on Traylor\u2019s breath.\n          The parties\u2019 versions of the events outside of the bar vary\n   significantly. According to Traylor, he cooperated as Yorka escorted him\n   past a crowd outside of the bar and shoved him into the street. Yorka\n\n          _____________________\n          1\n             Because this is an appeal from a summary judgment order, we discuss the\n   following facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Traylor. See Deville v.\n   Marcantel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"65780\"><a href=\"/opinion/65780/deville-v-marcantel/\">567 F.3d 156</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163\u201364 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam). However, we note factual\n   discrepancies where relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516          Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-10783\n\n\n   instructed Traylor to leave, but Traylor told Yorka that his wallet and\n   belongings were still inside Clutch. Yorka, however, remained adamant that\n   Traylor leave immediately. Traylor then walked towards the curb to find\n   assistance from a security guard or another person to help get his wallet. As\n   Traylor approached the curb, Yorka struck him in the face, causing him to\n   fall to the ground.\n          According to Yorka, Traylor was uncooperative as he escorted him\n   outside of the bar. Traylor repeatedly tried to turn around to go back inside,\n   but Yorka was able to regain control and shove Traylor into the street. Once\n   released, Traylor again tried to go back to the bar, saying \u201cthis sh** is not\n   over; this motherf***er started it.\u201d Yorka again pushed Traylor away\n   towards the street. When Traylor continued to make his way back towards\n   the bar, Yorka pushed him a second time. Traylor then used his forearm to\n   shove Yorka in the chest and neck area, creating separation between the two.\n   When Traylor again approached Yorka, Yorka punched him.\n          A bystander recorded a portion of the relevant events. The video\n   shows a crowded scene both inside and outside of the bar. The camera then\n   pans to the left and shows Traylor in a white hoodie standing in the street.\n   Yorka is standing a few feet away facing Traylor. Traylor leans forward and\n   walks in Yorka\u2019s direction. Yorka then punches Traylor in the face, and\n   Traylor falls to the ground. The interaction lasts only a few seconds before\n   the video cuts to the officers helping Yorka and an ambulance arriving.\n          The parties agree on the events after Yorka struck Traylor. An\n   ambulance took Traylor to the hospital. Traylor was then arrested and\n   charged with felony assault against a peace officer. The jail supervisor,\n   however, rejected the charge and reduced it to a class C misdemeanor for\n   offensive contact. Officers issued Traylor a citation and released him that\n   night. The misdemeanor was later dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516          Page: 4    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 22-10783\n\n\n          On February 25, 2021, Traylor filed this suit against Yorka pursuant\n   to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Upon\n   Yorka\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court granted qualified\n   immunity to Yorka on the excessive force and unlawful arrest claims.\n   However, the district court denied qualified immunity on Traylor\u2019s\n   fabrication-of-evidence claim. Both parties timely appealed.\n                   II.

Discussion\n           Traylor raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether Yorka was entitled to\n   qualified immunity on the excessive force claim; and (2) whether Yorka was\n   entitled to qualified immunity on the unlawful arrest claim. On cross appeal,\n   Yorka raises an additional issue of whether he was entitled to qualified\n   immunity on the fabrication-of-evidence claim. We address each issue in\n   turn.\n       A. Excessive Force\n           Under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\">, private citizens may sue public officials for\n   violations of their constitutional rights. However, \u201c[q]ualified immunity\n   shields from liability \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\n   violate the law.\u2019\u201d Romero v. City of Grapevine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4266172\"><a href=\"/opinion/4488919/martha-romero-v-city-of-grapevine-texas/\">888 F.3d 170</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (5th Cir.\n   2018) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\">475 U.S. 335</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1986)). To determine\n   whether qualified immunity bars a \u00a7 1983 claim, we ask (1) whether \u201cthe\n   official\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the right\n   was clearly established.\u201d Cunningham v. Castloo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">983 F.3d 185</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190\u201391 (5th\n   Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Traylor\u2019s\n   claim fails at the first inquiry because Yorka\u2019s use of force did not violate\n   Traylor\u2019s Fourth Amendment right.\n\n\n           _____________________\n           2\n             Because the district court entered final judgment on the excessive force and\n   unlawful arrest claims, these limitations apply only to the fabrication-of-evidence claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516           Page: 6    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 22-10783\n\n\n          To prevail on a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, a plaintiff\n   must show that he \u201csuffer[ed] an injury that result[ed] directly and only from\n   a clearly excessive and objectively unreasonable use of force.\u201d Joseph ex. rel.\n   Est. of Joseph v. Bartlett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">981 F.3d 319</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (5th Cir. 2020). The district court\n   did not address whether Traylor suffered an injury, but undisputed evidence\n   shows that he suffered a broken wrist from falling after Yorka\u2019s punch. Thus,\n   the only remaining issue is whether Yorka\u2019s use of force was \u201cobjectively\n   unreasonable.\u201d See Graham v. Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\">490 U.S. 386</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 (1989). We look to\n   several factors for this inquiry, including \u201c(1) the severity of the crime at\n   issue, (2) whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of\n   officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest or\n   attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d Joseph, 981 F.3d at 332 (citing Graham,\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\">490 U.S. at 396</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">). \u201cThe reasonableness of a particular use of force must be\n   judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than\n   with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d Darden v. City of Fort Worth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4239056\"><a href=\"/opinion/4461803/eric-darden-v-city-of-fort-worth-texas/\">880 F.3d\n   722</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729 (5th Cir. 2018) (quotation omitted).\n          Construing all factual disputes in Traylor\u2019s favor, Yorka\u2019s use of force\n   was not objectively unreasonable. Even under Traylor\u2019s version of events,\n   Yorka could have reasonably believed Traylor posed a threat. Clutch security\n   had just informed Yorka that Traylor had been in a fight, and Yorka observed\n   Traylor bloodied on the floor with a strong scent of alcohol. See Escobar v.\n   Montee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4293477\"><a href=\"/opinion/4516224/israel-escobar-v-lance-montee/\">895 F.3d 387</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394\u201395 (5th Cir. 2018) (considering that an officer had\n   been warned plaintiff was a threat). Most importantly, the video shows\n   Traylor moving quickly towards Yorka. Even accepting Traylor\u2019s version as\n   true, and therefore interpreting his actions as walking towards a third party\n   to ask about retrieving his wallet, the video still supports Yorka\u2019s perception\n   of a threat, which is the key question in such a quick and messy situation.\n   Indeed, Traylor leans forward then walks in Yorka\u2019s direction. Given\n   Traylor\u2019s insistence on retrieving his wallet and the information Yorka\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fCase: 22-10783      Document: 00517038516           Page: 7    Date Filed: 01/19/2024\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 22-10783\n\n\n   received about the fight, Yorka could have reasonably interpreted Traylor\u2019s\n   steps as a \u201ccharge\u201d towards him. Further, the video shows that only a couple\n   of seconds spanned between Traylor\u2019s steps towards Yorka and Yorka\u2019s\n   strike. The tense environment and need for a split-second decision indicate\n   that Yorka\u2019s use of force was not unreasonable. See Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\">490 U.S. at\n   </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">396\u201397 (\u201cThe calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact\n   that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in\n   circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the\n   amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d). In looking back,\n   it is always easy to think of other things that could have been done differently.\n   Yet, although Yorka\u2019s escalation to a strike to the face \u201cmay not have been\n   as restrained as we would like to expect from model police conduct . . .\n   qualified immunity \u2018protect[s] officers from the sometimes hazy border\n   between excessive and acceptable force\u2019\u201d in the moment.

Traylor claims that,\n   under his version, Yorka would have had no reason to doubt that he was\n   merely attempting to retrieve his wallet.        But Traylor disregards that\n   reasonability \u201cmust be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on\n   the scene.\u201d Darden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4239056\"><a href=\"/opinion/4461803/eric-darden-v-city-of-fort-worth-texas/\">880 F.3d at 729</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quotation omitted). Although Traylor\n   did submit evidence that his intent was to speak to a third party, he has not\n   produced evidence showing that this intent manifested in any outward\n   action. See Cloud v.

Traylor argues that the district\n   court erred by treating \u00a7 38.15 as a strict liability provision because the statute\n   instead requires a showing of criminal negligence. But Traylor provides no\n   authority requiring a showing of criminal negligence for arrest on suspected\n   violation of \u00a7 38.15.     Indeed, our precedent has not imposed such a\n   requirement. See, e.g., Haggerty v. Tex. S.

However, as\n   discussed above, Traylor must establish both a violation of his constitutional\n   right and that this right was clearly established. See Cunningham, 983 F.3d at\n   190\u201391. We may limit our analysis to the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong if it\n   resolves the qualified immunity issue. See Pearson v.

Because Cole did not clearly establish Traylor\u2019s right as\n   relevant here, we conclude that Yorka is entitled to qualified immunity.\n           A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff bears a heavy burden of establishing that an officer\n   violated clearly established law.

Traylor relies solely on Cole, in which we\n   established a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim for\n   fabrication of evidence. But we may not define clearly established law with\n   such a high level of generality. See al-Kidd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\">563 U.S. at 742</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Thus, Cole can establish Traylor\u2019s right only if the facts there\n   \u201csquarely govern[]\u201d the specific facts at issue here. See Kisela v.

This\n   case involves a quick and chaotic incident in which the parties have different\n   versions of events. Traylor has not shown that Yorka had the time or\n   deliberation to fabricate evidence of assault. Further, Traylor did not face\n   the extreme consequences as those of the plaintiff in Cole. Indeed, Traylor\u2019s\n   charge was reduced to a misdemeanor the same night of the incident. Given\n   this significant divergence of facts, Cole did not clearly establish that \u201cevery\n   reasonable official\u201d in Yorka\u2019s position would have understood that his\n   conduct violated Traylor\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right. See Mullenix, 577\n   U.S. at 11 (quotation omitted). Yorka is thus entitled to qualified immunity\n   on Traylor\u2019s fabrication-of-evidence claim.\n                                     IV.      Conclusion\n           For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s\n   order granting qualified immunity to Yorka on the excessive force and\n   unlawful arrest claims.
