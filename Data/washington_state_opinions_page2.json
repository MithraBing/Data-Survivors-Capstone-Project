See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 27.003; TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131. By three issues that we have\n\nreorganized, Gonzalez argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss\n\fbecause: (1) Graham lacks standing to bring her claim; (2) the TCPA applies to his claim\n\nand Graham failed to demonstrate a prima facie case with clear and specific evidence;\n\nand (3) permitting Graham to bring her claim against Gonzalez violates the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. See U.S. CONST. amends. I,\n\nXIV. We affirm.\n\n                                   I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On December 13, 2021, Gonzalez filed an application to oppose Graham for the\n\noffice of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. Graham, as the\n\nincumbent County Chair, rejected Gonzalez\u2019s application for incompleteness. Gonzalez\n\nfiled a petition for writ of mandamus in this Court, seeking review of Graham\u2019s decision.\n\nIn re Gonzalez, No. 13-21-00452-CV, 2022 WL 37769, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013\n\nEdinburg Jan. 4, 2022, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). We concluded that \u201cGonzalez\u2019s\n\napplication failed to comply with the express requirements of the election code,\u201d and\n\ntherefore, \u201cGraham had a ministerial duty to reject Gonzalez\u2019s application.\u201d Id. Gonzalez\n\nwas ultimately prevented from appearing on the March 2022 Republican primary ballot,\n\nand Graham won reelection.\n\n       On August 2, 2022, Graham filed her original petition in the underlying case.\n\nAccording to her petition, Gonzalez \u201cfailed to abide by the requirements of Title 15 of the\n\nTexas Election Code\u201d because he \u201cfailed to appoint a campaign treasurer with the Texas\n\nEthics Commission upon becoming a candidate.\u201d See TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 252.001\n\n(entitled \u201cAppointment of Campaign Treasurer Required\u201d). In addition, Graham alleged\n\nthat Gonzalez \u201caccepted political contributions and made and/or authorized campaign\n\n\n                                            2\n\fexpenditures at a time when he did not have a campaign treasurer appointment in effect.\u201d\n\nSee id. \u00a7 253.031 (entitled \u201cContribution and Expenditure Without Campaign Treasurer\n\nProhibited\u201d). Therefore, Graham sought to recover damages under \u00a7 253.131 of the\n\nTexas Election Code. See id. \u00a7 253.131 (\u201cA person who knowingly makes or accepts a\n\ncampaign contribution or makes a campaign expenditure in violation of this chapter is\n\nliable for damages as provided by this section.\u201d).\n\n       On November 21, 2022, Gonzalez filed his TCPA motion to dismiss, alleging that\n\nGraham\u2019s claim was based on or brought in response to his exercise of his First\n\nAmendment rights to free speech, to petition, and to freely associate. See U.S. CONST.\n\namend. I; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.003(a). He also alleged that the suit\n\nwas brought in response to conduct protected by \u00a7 27.010(b)(1) of the civil practice and\n\nremedies code. Id. \u00a7 27.010(b)(1) (providing that the TCPA applies to a suit arising out of\n\nconduct relating to \u201cpromotion of a dramatic, literary, musical, political, journalistic, or\n\notherwise artistic work\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n       Additionally, Gonzalez argued that Graham lacked standing to bring her claim, as\n\nshe suffered no injury. Gonzalez specifically alleged that \u201cGraham ran for county chair[]\n\nuncontested and spent $0 to defeat her non-exist[ent] political opponent.\u201d He further\n\nasserted that, to the extent Graham did suffer an injury, it was a \u201csovereign injury\u201d rather\n\nthan a \u201cproprietary injury,\u201d \u201c[a]nd neither the Texas Election Code, nor the Texas\n\nConstitution, authorize private citizens to assert sovereign injuries.\u201d Lastly, Gonzalez\n\nargued that even if \u00a7 253.131 provided standing for politicians to sue their opponents,\n\n\u201cthen it should hold those sections unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Gonzalez,\u201d as \u201c[a]\n\n\n                                              3\n\fstatute purporting to vest individuals with the authority to recover civil damages for\n\nviolations of campaign finance law cannot override the basic constitutional principle[] of\n\nstanding.\u201d\n\n       Attached to Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss was his unsworn declaration in which he\n\ndetailed that he paid a law firm \u201c$6,217.50 to pursue the mandamus action,\u201d and\n\n\u201caccepted $700 from five friends to help pay [his] attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d during a time when no\n\ncampaign treasurer appointment was in effect. Gonzalez explained that he \u201crelied on the\n\nTexas Ethics Commission\u2019s [TEC] website, which states \u2018If you are on an upcoming\n\nballot . . . . , then Texas state law requires all candidates . . . to file a campaign treasurer\n\nappointment . . . .\u2019\u201d As he would not be on the upcoming ballot, Gonzalez did not believe\n\nhe was required to file a campaign treasurer appointment.\n\n       Gonzalez also represented that, after Graham filed a sworn complaint on January\n\n19, 2022, \u201cwith the [TEC] alleging that [he] had violated the [Texas] Election Code,\u201d he\n\nreturned the $700 he received from friends and filed a campaign treasurer appointment\n\n\u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d According to Gonzalez, Graham\u2019s sworn complaint with\n\nthe TEC was resolved on April 19, 2022, when he signed an \u201cAssurance of Voluntary\n\nCompliance.\u201d The TEC \u201camicably settled the issues complained of in this case, assessing\n\nno penalties against [Gonzalez] for [his] allegedly belated filings.\u201d\n\n       Gonzalez also attached to his motion to dismiss: (1) the campaign treasurer\n\nappointment filing that was received by the TEC on February 1, 2022; (2) campaign\n\nfinance reports which itemized the campaign funds accepted and expended by Gonzalez;\n\nand (3) campaign finance reports which demonstrated that Graham accepted and\n\n\n                                               4\n\fexpended no campaign funds in furtherance of her own candidacy.\n\n       On December 6, 2022, Graham amended her petition to specify that, in addition to\n\nthe statutory damages allowed by \u00a7 253.131, she also \u201csuffered damages for lost wages\n\nand additional unreimbursed fees for legal costs associated with the campaign activities\n\nfor the Cameron County Primary against Mr. Gonzalez.\u201d That same day, Graham filed\n\nher response to Gonzalez\u2019s TCPA motion to dismiss, in which she argued that the TCPA\n\ndid not apply to her claim, but even if it did, she had clear and specific evidence to support\n\na prima facie case. Graham further asserted that \u201cif potential candidates fail to follow state\n\n[election] law and any opponents are not allowed to seek redress from the judicial\n\nbranch[,] such prohibition would be chilling on\u201d the exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\nAttached to her response were: (1) Gonzalez\u2019s campaign finance reports; and\n\n(2) Graham\u2019s affidavit, in which she averred that Gonzalez\u2019s political campaign caused\n\nher to miss \u201c40 hours\u201d of work and be personally liable for an undetermined amount of\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees stemming from the mandamus litigation.\n\n       Gonzalez subsequently filed a reply to Graham\u2019s response, reiterating much of the\n\nsame arguments as were raised in his initial motion to dismiss. However, he also\n\naddressed Graham\u2019s assertion that she suffered injuries in the form of lost wages and\n\npotential attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that Graham did not provide clear and specific evidence\n\nof these injuries and that her injuries were neither concrete and particularized nor\n\ntraceable to his conduct.\n\n       The trial court denied Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                     II.    STANDING\n\n       Gonzalez challenges Graham\u2019s standing to bring a claim under the election code\n\n\u201cbecause she did not incur any damages.\u201d \u201cBecause standing is a threshold jurisdictional\n\nissue that \u2018is essential to a court\u2019s power to decide a case,\u2019 we address that issue before\n\nturning to the substance of the TCPA motion.\u201d McLane Champions, LLC v. Hous.\n\nBaseball Partners, 671 S.W.3d 907, 912 (Tex. 2023) (quoting Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 553\u201354 (Tex. 2000)).\n\nA.     Applicable Law & Standard of Review\n\n       \u201cStanding requires an injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s\n\nconduct and likely to be redressed by a decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d Abbott v. Harris\n\nCounty, 672 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. 2023). An \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d is \u201can invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n\nconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Perez v. Turner, 653 S.W.3d 191, 198 (Tex. 2022) (citing\n\nHeckman v. Williamson County, 369 S.W.3d 137, 154\u201355 (Tex. 2012)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n       We review the issue of standing de novo. In re H.S., 550 S.W.3d 151, 155 (Tex.\n\n2018); Tex. Ass\u2019n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993). \u201cIn\n\nevaluating standing, we construe the pleadings in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, but we also consider\n\nrelevant evidence offered by the parties.\u201d In re H.S., 550 S.W.3d at 155. \u201cA plaintiff does\n\nnot lack standing simply because he cannot prevail on the merits of his claim; he lacks\n\nstanding because his claim of injury is too slight for a court to afford redress.\u201d\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman, 252 S.W.3d 299, 305 (Tex. 2008).\n\n\n                                             6\n\fB.     Analysis\n\n       First, we must resolve an ancillary issue. Gonzalez contends that \u201cGraham has no\n\nclear and specific evidence of an actual, concrete and particularized, non-conjectural,\n\nnon-hypothetical injury.\u201d See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.005 (\u201cThe court may\n\nnot dismiss a legal action under this section if the party bringing the legal action\n\nestablishes by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element\n\nof the claim in question.\u201d (emphasis added)). But Gonzalez does not explain why a\n\nheightened evidentiary burden should apply when the issue of standing is raised in a\n\nTCPA motion to dismiss. We have found no authority suggesting that a novel evidentiary\n\nburden is required in this context, and so we decline to adopt such a burden here. See\n\nBuzbee v. Clear Channel Outdoor, LLC, 616 S.W.3d 14, 22 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2020, no pet.) (\u201c[I]t does not follow that a court must analyze jurisdiction using the\n\nTCPA burden-shifting procedure, a mechanism ill-suited for resolving whether a court is\n\nauthorized to decide a controversy.\u201d).\n\n       Graham alleged in her live pleading that Gonzalez was liable to her for damages\n\nunder \u00a7 253.131 of the election code, citing both subsections (b) and (c) of the statute.\n\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c). Subsection (b) provides that \u201c[i]f the\n\n[unlawful] contribution or expenditure is in support of a candidate, each opposing\n\ncandidate whose name appears on the ballot is entitled to recover damages under this\n\nsection.\u201d Id. \u00a7 253.131(b). And subsection (c) provides that \u201c[i]f the [unlawful] contribution\n\nor expenditure is in opposition to a candidate, the candidate is entitled to recover\n\ndamages under this section.\u201d Id. \u00a7 253.131(c).\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       Gonzalez does not dispute that subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 253.131 apply to\n\nGraham\u2019s claim. Gonzalez relies on Spokeo and TransUnion, two recent United States\n\nSupreme Court cases, to argue that Graham lacks standing, despite statutory\n\nauthorization to sue, because she has not suffered an injury-in-fact. See TransUnion LLC\n\nv. Ramirez, 141 S.Ct. 2190 (2021); Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330 (2016); see also\n\nTex. Ass\u2019n Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex. 1993) (\u201cBecause\n\nstanding is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under both federal and Texas\n\nlaw, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts on this\n\nsubject for any guidance it may yield.\u201d).\n\n       Certainly, these cases stand for the proposition that a plaintiff will not\n\n\u201cautomatically satisf[y] the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person\n\na statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.\u201d\n\nSpokeo, 578 U.S. at 341; see TransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2205. But Spokeo and TransUnion\n\nalso recognized that the legislative branch is often well-poised to identify injuries-in-fact\n\nand to adopt statutes that provide remedies for those injuries. See TransUnion, 141 S.Ct.\n\nat 2204 (\u201cCourts must afford due respect to Congress\u2019s decision to impose a statutory\n\nprohibition or obligation on a defendant, and to grant a plaintiff a cause of action to sue\n\nover the defendant\u2019s violation of that statutory prohibition or obligation.\u201d); Spokeo, 578\n\nU.S. at 342 (explaining that \u201cthe violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be\n\nsufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact,\u201d and a litigant \u201cneed not allege\n\nany additional harm beyond the one Congress has identified\u201d to have Article III standing);\n\nsee also Warth v.

Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339. A\n\nconcrete injury is not \u201cnecessarily synonymous with \u2018tangible.\u2019 Although tangible injuries\n\nare perhaps easier to recognize, we have confirmed in many of our previous cases that\n\nintangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.\u201d Id. at 340 (first citing Pleasant Grove\n\nCity v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460 (2009); and then citing Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.\n\nv. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993)); see Lujan v.

The United\n\nStates Supreme Court instructs lower courts to look to \u201chistory and tradition\u201d when\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff\u2019s alleged intangible injury provides her with standing. See\n\nTransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2204; Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341. Specifically, the Spokeo Court\n\nexplained that\n\n       [b]ecause the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy\n       requirement, and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical\n       practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has\n       a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as\n       providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\n\n578 U.S. at 340\u201341. \u201cIn looking to whether a plaintiff\u2019s asserted harm has a \u2018close\n\nrelationship\u2019 to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in\n\n\n                                              9\n\fAmerican courts, we do not require an exact duplicate.\u201d TransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2209.\n\n\u201c[T]raditional harms may also include harms specified by the Constitution itself.\u201d Id. at\n\n2204. And \u201cbecause Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet\n\nminimum Article III requirements, its judgment is also instructive and important.\u201d Spokeo,\n\n578 U.S. at 341.\n\n       The supreme court has already recognized that private individuals can have a\n\nconcrete interest in ensuring that an election is \u201cvalidly conducted.\u201d Brown v. Todd, 53\n\nS.W.3d 297, 303 (Tex. 2001); see Blum v. Lanier, 997 S.W.2d 259, 264 (Tex. 1999). In\n\naddition,   our    constitution   specifically    authorizes   the    Legislature    to   \u201cmake\n\nsuch . . . regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the\n\npurity of the ballot box.\u201d TEX. CONST. art. 6, \u00a7 4. Early on in this state\u2019s history, our highest\n\ncourt recognized that if \u201cthe preservation and enforcement of the purity of the conduct of\n\nelections. . . . cannot be done, then one of the very foundations of our system of\n\ngovernment may be seriously impaired.\u201d De Shazo v. Webb, 113 S.W.2d 519, 524 (Tex.\n\n1938); see State v. Connor, 23 S.W. 1103, 1107 (Tex. 1893) (\u201c[T]he public has a right\n\nthat the ballot shall be protected from fraud . . . .\u201d). In recognition of its duty to defend\n\nagainst election fraud, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 253.131 of the election code, and we\n\nmust afford that decision due respect. See TransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2204 (\u201cCourts must\n\nafford due respect to Congress\u2019s decision to impose a statutory prohibition or obligation\n\non a defendant . . . .\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that Graham had a concrete interest in\n\nensuring that the election was validly conducted. See Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 303.\n\n       \u201cAn injury is particularized for standing purposes if it affects the plaintiff in a\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fpersonal and individual way.\u201d Data Foundry, Inc. v. City of Austin, 620 S.W.3d 692, 696\n\n(Tex. 2021) (citing Spokeo, 136 S.Ct. at 1548) (cleaned up). Gonzalez argues that only\n\nthe State of Texas has standing in this case to enforce a violation of the election code.\n\nBut the supreme court has specifically recognized \u00a7 253.131 as a right available to private\n\nindividuals to ensure compliance with campaign finance requirements. See Osterberg v.\n\nPeca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 49 (Tex. 2000) (\u201cBecause state resources for policing election laws\n\nare necessarily limited, in many cases [\u00a7] 253.131 is likely to provide the only viable\n\nmeans of enforcing reporting requirements.\u201d); see also City of El Paso v. Tom Brown\n\nMinistries, 505 S.W.3d 124, 139 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2016, no pet.) (\u201cThe Texas\n\nSupreme Court recognizes that the right to enforce the Texas Election Code . . . for\n\ndamages under Section 253.131 is a private right of action for the protection of private\n\nrights.\u201d (citing Osterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 49)).\n\n       In his reply to Graham\u2019s response, Gonzalez asserted that the subject matter of\n\nGraham\u2019s suit consists of \u201callegations that Mr. Gonzalez attempted to organize a\n\ncampaign for political office against her, including filing an application for a place on the\n\nballot, filing campaign-finance forms, and filing a mandamus lawsuit seeking a place on\n\nthe ballot.\u201d (Emphasis added). Because he categorized the act of filing a mandamus\n\nlawsuit as part of an \u201cattempt to organize a campaign for political office against [Graham],\u201d\n\nit seems apparent that when Gonzalez paid a law firm \u201c$6,217.50 to pursue the\n\nmandamus action\u201d and \u201caccepted $700 from five friends\u201d \u201c[i]n connection with the\n\nlitigation,\u201d he was also \u201cattempt[ing] to organize a campaign for political office against\n\nher.\u201d In other words, Gonzalez received and spent these campaign contributions and\n\n\n                                             11\n\fexpenditures to specifically oppose Graham. See TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(c).\n\n        Our sister court found such an injury sufficient to confer standing in Buzbee v.\n\nClear Channel Outdoor, LLC, 616 S.W.3d at 24. In that case, Buzbee, a mayoral\n\ncandidate, sued his political opponent\u2014the incumbent mayor\u2014and an advertiser that\n\nprovided billboards for the incumbent mayor. Id. at 20. The court of appeals agreed with\n\nBuzbee that the incumbent mayor and the advertiser acted \u201cin opposition\u201d to his\n\ncampaign, and it concluded that this resulted in \u201ca concrete, particularized harm that\n\ndistinguishes [Buzbee\u2019s] alleged injury from that of the general public.\u201d Id. at 24. It further\n\nconcluded that Buzbee had standing to assert a claim under \u00a7 253.131(c) of the election\n\ncode. Id.\n\n        The record demonstrates that Gonzalez accepted illegal campaign contributions\n\nwith the specific intent to oppose Graham\u2019s candidacy. Therefore, Graham\u2019s injury is\n\ndistinct from that of the public at large. See Buzbee, 616 S.W.3d at 24. The fact that the\n\nState might also have the option of enforcing election code violations does not deprive\n\nGraham of standing. See Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998) (\u201c[T]he\n\nfact that [an injury] is widely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutional power to\n\nauthorize its vindication in the federal courts.\u201d). We conclude that Graham\u2019s alleged injury\n\nwas sufficiently particularized.1\n\n        Next, we determine whether Graham suffered an \u201cactual\u201d injury as opposed to a\n\nmerely \u201chypothetical\u201d one. See Inman, 252 S.W.3d at 304\u201305. Here, Graham\u2019s allegation\n\n\n\n        1 Because of this, we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s argument that \u00a7 253.131 is unconstitutional\n\nbecause it permits Graham to assert a \u201csovereign injury,\u201d rather than a private injury, is unfounded, and we\noverrule it.\n                                                    12\n\fthat Gonzalez accepted illegal campaign contributions means that Gonzalez\u2019s unlawful\n\nconduct tainted the electoral process. Simply because an injury may be difficult to\n\nmeasure does not render that injury \u201chypothetical.\u201d Cf. Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S.\n\n497, 521 (2007) (concluding that potential side effects of climate change qualified as an\n\nactual injury, sufficient to confer Massachusetts with standing to sue the EPA for failing\n\nto regulate greenhouse gas emissions); Tex. Propane Gas Ass\u2019ns v. City of Houston, 622\n\nS.W.3d 791, 800 (Tex. 2021) (\u201cTPGA has standing to challenge regulations it claims the\n\nCity had no authority to enact.\u201d). That Graham eventually won the election and that\n\nGonzalez returned the campaign contributions does not render the injury hypothetical. At\n\nbest, these are facts that relate to the merits of Graham\u2019s case, not whether she suffered\n\nany injury. We conclude that Graham suffered an injury-in-fact.\n\n        Additionally, Gonzalez\u2019s conduct is fairly traceable to Graham\u2019s injury. There is no\n\nneed to show the exact responsibility the defendant bears for the alleged injuries, so long\n\nas a plaintiff can trace these injuries to the defendant\u2019s conduct. Heckman, 369 S.W.3d\n\nat 157. Here, Gonzalez\u2019s unlawful campaign finance activities violated Graham\u2019s interest\n\nin ensuring the election was validly conducted. We therefore conclude Graham has\n\ndemonstrated this element of standing.\n\n        To summarize, we conclude that Graham has demonstrated an injury-in-fact and\n\ncausation. 2 Therefore, we further conclude that Graham has standing to bring the\n\n\n        2  Gonzalez does not challenge the redressability component of standing. Nonetheless, we\nconclude this requirement has also been adequately satisfied. See Dep\u2019t of Educ. v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551,\n561 (2023) (\u201c[W]hen a statute affords a litigant \u2018a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,\u2019 the\nlitigant may establish Article III jurisdiction without meeting the usual \u2018standards for redressability and\nimmediacy.\u2019\u201d (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992))); see also Uzuegbunam v.\nPreczewski, 141 S.Ct. 792, 802 (2021) (\u201c[W]e conclude that a request for nominal damages satisfies the\nredressability element of standing where a plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on a completed violation of a legal\n                                                    13\n\funderlying claims in this case.\n\n                                            III.

Analysis\n\n       Gonzalez and Graham dispute whether the TCPA applies to Graham\u2019s claim.\n\nNonetheless, for purposes of our analysis, we will assume without deciding that the TCPA\n\napplies.\n\n       The second step of the TCPA requires us to examine whether Graham has\n\nestablished through clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential\n\nelement of her claim. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.005(c); In re Lipsky,\n\n460 S.W.3d at 590. To succeed on a \u00a7 253.131 claim, a plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant knowingly made or accepted a campaign contribution or made a campaign\n\nexpenditure in violation of Chapter 253 of the election code. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 253.131(a). To be entitled to damages, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the\n\ncontribution or expenditure was made in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s candidacy or in\n\nsupport of the defendant\u2019s candidacy. Id. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c).\n\n       1.     Knowingly Made or Accepted a Campaign Contribution or Expenditure\n\n       A claimant is not required to show that the candidate knowingly violated Chapter\n\n253 of the election code. Osterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 38. Rather, \u201c\u2018knowingly\u2019 applies only to\n\nwhether a person is making a \u2018campaign contribution\u2019 or \u2018campaign expenditure.\u2019\u201d Id. at\n\n39. A \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d is \u201ca contribution to a candidate or political committee that\n\n\n                                            15\n\fis offered or given with the intent that it be used in connection with a campaign for elective\n\noffice or on a measure.\u201d TEX.

One of these reports covered the period of July 1,\n\n2021, through December 31, 2021. In this report, Gonzalez reported receiving\n\n\u201cPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\u201d in the amount of $700 and making \u201cPOLITICAL\n\nEXPENDITURES\u201d in the amount of $4,000. Gonzalez described the purpose of the\n\nexpenditures as \u201clegal representation to try to become a candidate after [his] application\n\nwas rejected.\u201d See id. Gonzalez swore, \u201cunder penalty of perjury, that the . . . report is\n\ntrue and correct and includes all information required to be reported by [Gonzalez] under\n\nTitle 15, Election Code.\u201d See In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d at 591 (holding that circumstantial\n\nevidence can be used to establish a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case under the TCPA). Based\n\non this, we conclude that Graham provided clear and specific evidence that Gonzalez\n\nknowingly made or accepted a campaign contribution or expenditure.\n\n       2.     Violated Chapter 253 of the Election Code\n\n       Graham specifically alleged that Gonzalez\u2019s expenditures and contributions\n\nviolated \u00a7 253.031 of the Texas Election Code. This statute prohibits candidates from\n\n\u201caccept[ing] a campaign contribution or mak[ing] or authoriz[ing] a campaign expenditure\n\nat a time when a campaign treasurer appointment for the candidate is not in effect.\u201d TEX.\n\nELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.031(a) (entitled \u201cContribution and Expenditure Without Campaign\n\n\n                                             16\n\fTreasurer Prohibited\u201d).\n\n       Attached to Graham\u2019s response was a copy of Gonzalez\u2019s campaign treasurer\n\nappointment. The document indicated that Gonzalez made the appointment on January\n\n28, 2022, it was received by the TEC on February 1, 2022, and it was processed by the\n\nTEC on February 7, 2022. However, as noted above, the record indicates that Gonzalez\n\nboth accepted campaign contributions and made campaign expenditures between July\n\n1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Thus, the record affirmatively indicates that Gonzalez\n\n\u201caccept[ed] a campaign contribution or ma[de] . . . a campaign expenditure at a time when\n\na campaign treasurer appointment for the candidate [was] not in effect.\u201d See id.\n\n       Gonzalez argues that he relied on advice promulgated on the Texas Ethics\n\nCommission\u2019s website \u201cand believed that filing a campaign treasurer\u2019s appointment was\n\nunnecessary.\u201d But, as already discussed above, to demonstrate a prima facie case,\n\nGraham was not required to show that Gonzalez knowingly violated the law, just that he\n\nknowingly accepted a campaign contribution or made a campaign expenditure. See\n\nOsterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 38. We conclude that Graham met her burden to demonstrate\n\nthis element by clear and specific evidence.\n\n       3.     Damages\n\n       A claimant\u2019s entitlement to damages is determined based on whether the\n\ncontribution or expenditure is \u201cin support of a candidate\u201d or \u201cin opposition to a candidate.\u201d\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c). Gonzalez argues that he was never a candidate\n\nbecause his ballot application was rejected, and \u00a7 253.131 therefore cannot support\n\nGraham\u2019s claims. We disagree. \u201cCandidate\u201d is defined in Title 15 of the election code as\n\n\n                                             17\n\f\u201ca person who knowingly and willingly takes affirmative action for the purpose of gaining\n\nnomination or election to public office or for the purpose of satisfying financial obligations\n\nincurred by the person in connection with the campaign for nomination or election.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 251.001(1). As examples of an \u201caffirmative action\u201d one might take to be a candidate,\n\nthe election code lists, inter alia, \u201cthe filing of an application for a place on a ballot\u201d and\n\n\u201cthe soliciting or accepting of a campaign contribution or the making of a campaign\n\nexpenditure.\u201d Id. \u00a7 251.001(1)(B), (G).\n\n       Here, it is undisputed that Gonzalez filed an application to run against Graham for\n\nthe position of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. We have also\n\ndetermined that the evidence is sufficient to show that he accepted campaign\n\ncontributions and made campaign expenditures. Therefore, we conclude that Gonzalez\n\nwas a candidate for purposes of \u00a7 253.131. See id. \u00a7 251.001(1)(B), (G).\n\n       Graham has made a prima facie showing that, because Gonzalez accepted\n\ncampaign contributions and made campaign expenditures, Graham, as the opposing\n\ncandidate whose name appeared on the ballot, is entitled to receive statutory damages\n\nin the amount of \u201ctwice the value of the unlawful contribution or expenditure\u201d and\n\n\u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the suit.\u201d See id. \u00a7 253.131(b), (d). Graham further\n\nprovided evidence, in the form of Gonzalez\u2019s campaign finance reports, to demonstrate\n\nthe specific value of the unlawful contributions and expenditures for which she seeks to\n\nrecover. We conclude that Graham has provided clear and specific evidence of this\n\nelement.3\n\n\n       3 Gonzalez argues that awarding Graham damages would constitute a windfall, as Graham has\n\nalready won the election, she spent no money on her campaign, and it is Gonzalez who has suffered by\n                                                18\n\fC.      Conclusion\n\n        In sum, Graham has demonstrated a prima facie case for her \u00a7 253.131 claim with\n\nclear and specific evidence, and we therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndenying Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 27.005(c).\n\n                              IV.     CONSTITUTIONALITY OF \u00a7 253.131\n\n        Finally, Gonzalez contends that, as applied to him, \u00a7 253.131 violates his First and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights. See U.S. CONST. amends. I, XIV. Gonzalez argued to the\n\ntrial court that the TCPA applied to Graham\u2019s cause of action because it was based on or\n\nbrought in response to his exercise of his First Amendment rights. However, he did not\n\nargue that \u00a7 253.131 was unconstitutional as it applied to him because it violated his First\n\nor Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n        The TCPA is not synonymous with the First Amendment. See Sanchez v. Striever,\n\n614 S.W.3d 233, 243 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.); Kawcak v. Antero\n\nRes. Corp., 582 S.W.3d 566, 575 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2019, pet. denied). Though we\n\nmay look to constitutional jurisprudence when analyzing the TCPA\u2019s applicability, see\n\nSanchez, 614 S.W.3d at 24, whether the TCPA protects certain speech and whether a\n\nseparate statute is unconstitutional because it chills speech are two different questions.\n\nTherefore, because the trial court has not had the opportunity to consider Graham\u2019s\n\nchallenge to \u00a7 253.131\u2019s constitutionality under the First Amendment, we must refrain\n\nfrom addressing the issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1; see also Perry v. Smyth, No. 13-19-\n\n\nnot being allowed to run for County Chair and having his reputation tarnished for making a simple mistake.\nThe appropriate audience for this argument is the ultimate factfinder in the case or the Legislature, not us.\n                                                    19\n\f00301-CV, 2020 WL 2776527, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg May 28, 2020,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.) (\u201cThe requirement for error preservation extends to constitutional\n\nchallenges, including challenges that a statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied\n\nto the appellant.\u201d).\n\n       Gonzalez\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment challenge fails for the same reason. Gonzalez\n\nargues that applying \u00a7 253.131 to him violates his substantive due process rights. See\n\nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV. But he did not seek a ruling on this claim below. See TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 33.1; see also Perry, 2020 WL 2776527, at *2.\n\n       Therefore, we overrule this issue.\n\n                                    V.

See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 27.003; TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131. By three issues that we have\n\nreorganized, Gonzalez argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss\n\fbecause: (1) Graham lacks standing to bring her claim; (2) the TCPA applies to his claim\n\nand Graham failed to demonstrate a prima facie case with clear and specific evidence;\n\nand (3) permitting Graham to bring her claim against Gonzalez violates the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. See U.S. CONST. amends. I,\n\nXIV. We affirm.\n\n                                   I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On December 13, 2021, Gonzalez filed an application to oppose Graham for the\n\noffice of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. Graham, as the\n\nincumbent County Chair, rejected Gonzalez\u2019s application for incompleteness. Gonzalez\n\nfiled a petition for writ of mandamus in this Court, seeking review of Graham\u2019s decision.\n\nIn re Gonzalez, No. 13-21-00452-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 WL 37769</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013\n\nEdinburg Jan. 4, 2022, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). We concluded that \u201cGonzalez\u2019s\n\napplication failed to comply with the express requirements of the election code,\u201d and\n\ntherefore, \u201cGraham had a ministerial duty to reject Gonzalez\u2019s application.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Gonzalez\n\nwas ultimately prevented from appearing on the March 2022 Republican primary ballot,\n\nand Graham won reelection.\n\n       On August 2, 2022, Graham filed her original petition in the underlying case.\n\nAccording to her petition, Gonzalez \u201cfailed to abide by the requirements of Title 15 of the\n\nTexas Election Code\u201d because he \u201cfailed to appoint a campaign treasurer with the Texas\n\nEthics Commission upon becoming a candidate.\u201d See TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 252.001\n\n(entitled \u201cAppointment of Campaign Treasurer Required\u201d). In addition, Graham alleged\n\nthat Gonzalez \u201caccepted political contributions and made and/or authorized campaign\n\n\n                                            2\n\fexpenditures at a time when he did not have a campaign treasurer appointment in effect.\u201d\n\nSee id. \u00a7 253.031 (entitled \u201cContribution and Expenditure Without Campaign Treasurer\n\nProhibited\u201d). Therefore, Graham sought to recover damages under \u00a7 253.131 of the\n\nTexas Election Code. See id. \u00a7 253.131 (\u201cA person who knowingly makes or accepts a\n\ncampaign contribution or makes a campaign expenditure in violation of this chapter is\n\nliable for damages as provided by this section.\u201d).\n\n       On November 21, 2022, Gonzalez filed his TCPA motion to dismiss, alleging that\n\nGraham\u2019s claim was based on or brought in response to his exercise of his First\n\nAmendment rights to free speech, to petition, and to freely associate. See U.S. CONST.\n\namend. I; TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.003(a). He also alleged that the suit\n\nwas brought in response to conduct protected by \u00a7 27.010(b)(1) of the civil practice and\n\nremedies code. Id. \u00a7 27.010(b)(1) (providing that the TCPA applies to a suit arising out of\n\nconduct relating to \u201cpromotion of a dramatic, literary, musical, political, journalistic, or\n\notherwise artistic work\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n       Additionally, Gonzalez argued that Graham lacked standing to bring her claim, as\n\nshe suffered no injury. Gonzalez specifically alleged that \u201cGraham ran for county chair[]\n\nuncontested and spent $0 to defeat her non-exist[ent] political opponent.\u201d He further\n\nasserted that, to the extent Graham did suffer an injury, it was a \u201csovereign injury\u201d rather\n\nthan a \u201cproprietary injury,\u201d \u201c[a]nd neither the Texas Election Code, nor the Texas\n\nConstitution, authorize private citizens to assert sovereign injuries.\u201d Lastly, Gonzalez\n\nargued that even if \u00a7 253.131 provided standing for politicians to sue their opponents,\n\n\u201cthen it should hold those sections unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Gonzalez,\u201d as \u201c[a]\n\n\n                                              3\n\fstatute purporting to vest individuals with the authority to recover civil damages for\n\nviolations of campaign finance law cannot override the basic constitutional principle[] of\n\nstanding.\u201d\n\n       Attached to Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss was his unsworn declaration in which he\n\ndetailed that he paid a law firm \u201c$6,217.50 to pursue the mandamus action,\u201d and\n\n\u201caccepted $700 from five friends to help pay [his] attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d during a time when no\n\ncampaign treasurer appointment was in effect. Gonzalez explained that he \u201crelied on the\n\nTexas Ethics Commission\u2019s [TEC] website, which states \u2018If you are on an upcoming\n\nballot . . . . , then Texas state law requires all candidates . . . to file a campaign treasurer\n\nappointment . . . .\u2019\u201d As he would not be on the upcoming ballot, Gonzalez did not believe\n\nhe was required to file a campaign treasurer appointment.\n\n       Gonzalez also represented that, after Graham filed a sworn complaint on January\n\n19, 2022, \u201cwith the [TEC] alleging that [he] had violated the [Texas] Election Code,\u201d he\n\nreturned the $700 he received from friends and filed a campaign treasurer appointment\n\n\u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d According to Gonzalez, Graham\u2019s sworn complaint with\n\nthe TEC was resolved on April 19, 2022, when he signed an \u201cAssurance of Voluntary\n\nCompliance.\u201d The TEC \u201camicably settled the issues complained of in this case, assessing\n\nno penalties against [Gonzalez] for [his] allegedly belated filings.\u201d\n\n       Gonzalez also attached to his motion to dismiss: (1) the campaign treasurer\n\nappointment filing that was received by the TEC on February 1, 2022; (2) campaign\n\nfinance reports which itemized the campaign funds accepted and expended by Gonzalez;\n\nand (3) campaign finance reports which demonstrated that Graham accepted and\n\n\n                                               4\n\fexpended no campaign funds in furtherance of her own candidacy.\n\n       On December 6, 2022, Graham amended her petition to specify that, in addition to\n\nthe statutory damages allowed by \u00a7 253.131, she also \u201csuffered damages for lost wages\n\nand additional unreimbursed fees for legal costs associated with the campaign activities\n\nfor the Cameron County Primary against Mr. Gonzalez.\u201d That same day, Graham filed\n\nher response to Gonzalez\u2019s TCPA motion to dismiss, in which she argued that the TCPA\n\ndid not apply to her claim, but even if it did, she had clear and specific evidence to support\n\na prima facie case. Graham further asserted that \u201cif potential candidates fail to follow state\n\n[election] law and any opponents are not allowed to seek redress from the judicial\n\nbranch[,] such prohibition would be chilling on\u201d the exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\nAttached to her response were: (1) Gonzalez\u2019s campaign finance reports; and\n\n(2) Graham\u2019s affidavit, in which she averred that Gonzalez\u2019s political campaign caused\n\nher to miss \u201c40 hours\u201d of work and be personally liable for an undetermined amount of\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees stemming from the mandamus litigation.\n\n       Gonzalez subsequently filed a reply to Graham\u2019s response, reiterating much of the\n\nsame arguments as were raised in his initial motion to dismiss. However, he also\n\naddressed Graham\u2019s assertion that she suffered injuries in the form of lost wages and\n\npotential attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that Graham did not provide clear and specific evidence\n\nof these injuries and that her injuries were neither concrete and particularized nor\n\ntraceable to his conduct.\n\n       The trial court denied Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                     II.    STANDING\n\n       Gonzalez challenges Graham\u2019s standing to bring a claim under the election code\n\n\u201cbecause she did not incur any damages.\u201d \u201cBecause standing is a threshold jurisdictional\n\nissue that \u2018is essential to a court\u2019s power to decide a case,\u2019 we address that issue before\n\nturning to the substance of the TCPA motion.\u201d McLane Champions, LLC v.

Analysis\n\n       First, we must resolve an ancillary issue. Gonzalez contends that \u201cGraham has no\n\nclear and specific evidence of an actual, concrete and particularized, non-conjectural,\n\nnon-hypothetical injury.\u201d See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.005 (\u201cThe court may\n\nnot dismiss a legal action under this section if the party bringing the legal action\n\nestablishes by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element\n\nof the claim in question.\u201d (emphasis added)). But Gonzalez does not explain why a\n\nheightened evidentiary burden should apply when the issue of standing is raised in a\n\nTCPA motion to dismiss. We have found no authority suggesting that a novel evidentiary\n\nburden is required in this context, and so we decline to adopt such a burden here. See\n\nBuzbee v. Clear Channel Outdoor, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">616 S.W.3d 14</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2020, no pet.) (\u201c[I]t does not follow that a court must analyze jurisdiction using the\n\nTCPA burden-shifting procedure, a mechanism ill-suited for resolving whether a court is\n\nauthorized to decide a controversy.\u201d).\n\n       Graham alleged in her live pleading that Gonzalez was liable to her for damages\n\nunder \u00a7 253.131 of the election code, citing both subsections (b) and (c) of the statute.\n\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c). Subsection (b) provides that \u201c[i]f the\n\n[unlawful] contribution or expenditure is in support of a candidate, each opposing\n\ncandidate whose name appears on the ballot is entitled to recover damages under this\n\nsection.\u201d Id. \u00a7 253.131(b). And subsection (c) provides that \u201c[i]f the [unlawful] contribution\n\nor expenditure is in opposition to a candidate, the candidate is entitled to recover\n\ndamages under this section.\u201d Id. \u00a7 253.131(c).\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       Gonzalez does not dispute that subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 253.131 apply to\n\nGraham\u2019s claim. Gonzalez relies on Spokeo and TransUnion, two recent United States\n\nSupreme Court cases, to argue that Graham lacks standing, despite statutory\n\nauthorization to sue, because she has not suffered an injury-in-fact. See TransUnion LLC\n\nv. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">141 S.Ct. 2190 (2021)</span><pre class=\"inline\">; Spokeo, Inc. v.

Specifically, the Spokeo Court\n\nexplained that\n\n       [b]ecause the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy\n       requirement, and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical\n       practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has\n       a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as\n       providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\n\n578 U.S. at 340\u201341. \u201cIn looking to whether a plaintiff\u2019s asserted harm has a \u2018close\n\nrelationship\u2019 to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in\n\n\n                                              9\n\fAmerican courts, we do not require an exact duplicate.\u201d TransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2209.\n\n\u201c[T]raditional harms may also include harms specified by the Constitution itself.\u201d Id. at\n\n2204. And \u201cbecause Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet\n\nminimum Article III requirements, its judgment is also instructive and important.\u201d Spokeo,\n\n578 U.S. at 341.\n\n       The supreme court has already recognized that private individuals can have a\n\nconcrete interest in ensuring that an election is \u201cvalidly conducted.\u201d Brown v.

Early on in this state\u2019s history, our highest\n\ncourt recognized that if \u201cthe preservation and enforcement of the purity of the conduct of\n\nelections. . . . cannot be done, then one of the very foundations of our system of\n\ngovernment may be seriously impaired.\u201d De Shazo v.

(\u201cThe Texas\n\nSupreme Court recognizes that the right to enforce the Texas Election Code . . . for\n\ndamages under Section 253.131 is a private right of action for the protection of private\n\nrights.\u201d (citing Osterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 49)).\n\n       In his reply to Graham\u2019s response, Gonzalez asserted that the subject matter of\n\nGraham\u2019s suit consists of \u201callegations that Mr. Gonzalez attempted to organize a\n\ncampaign for political office against her, including filing an application for a place on the\n\nballot, filing campaign-finance forms, and filing a mandamus lawsuit seeking a place on\n\nthe ballot.\u201d (Emphasis added). Because he categorized the act of filing a mandamus\n\nlawsuit as part of an \u201cattempt to organize a campaign for political office against [Graham],\u201d\n\nit seems apparent that when Gonzalez paid a law firm \u201c$6,217.50 to pursue the\n\nmandamus action\u201d and \u201caccepted $700 from five friends\u201d \u201c[i]n connection with the\n\nlitigation,\u201d he was also \u201cattempt[ing] to organize a campaign for political office against\n\nher.\u201d In other words, Gonzalez received and spent these campaign contributions and\n\n\n                                             11\n\fexpenditures to specifically oppose Graham. See TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(c).\n\n        Our sister court found such an injury sufficient to confer standing in Buzbee v.\n\nClear Channel Outdoor, LLC, 616 S.W.3d at 24. In that case, Buzbee, a mayoral\n\ncandidate, sued his political opponent\u2014the incumbent mayor\u2014and an advertiser that\n\nprovided billboards for the incumbent mayor. Id. at 20. The court of appeals agreed with\n\nBuzbee that the incumbent mayor and the advertiser acted \u201cin opposition\u201d to his\n\ncampaign, and it concluded that this resulted in \u201ca concrete, particularized harm that\n\ndistinguishes [Buzbee\u2019s] alleged injury from that of the general public.\u201d Id. at 24. It further\n\nconcluded that Buzbee had standing to assert a claim under \u00a7 253.131(c) of the election\n\ncode. Id.\n\n        The record demonstrates that Gonzalez accepted illegal campaign contributions\n\nwith the specific intent to oppose Graham\u2019s candidacy. Therefore, Graham\u2019s injury is\n\ndistinct from that of the public at large. See Buzbee, 616 S.W.3d at 24. The fact that the\n\nState might also have the option of enforcing election code violations does not deprive\n\nGraham of standing. See Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">524 U.S. 11</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1998) (\u201c[T]he\n\nfact that [an injury] is widely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutional power to\n\nauthorize its vindication in the federal courts.\u201d). We conclude that Graham\u2019s alleged injury\n\nwas sufficiently particularized.1\n\n        Next, we determine whether Graham suffered an \u201cactual\u201d injury as opposed to a\n\nmerely \u201chypothetical\u201d one. See Inman, 252 S.W.3d at 304\u201305. Here, Graham\u2019s allegation\n\n\n\n        1 Because of this, we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s argument that \u00a7 253.131 is unconstitutional\n\nbecause it permits Graham to assert a \u201csovereign injury,\u201d rather than a private injury, is unfounded, and we\noverrule it.\n                                                    12\n\fthat Gonzalez accepted illegal campaign contributions means that Gonzalez\u2019s unlawful\n\nconduct tainted the electoral process. Simply because an injury may be difficult to\n\nmeasure does not render that injury \u201chypothetical.\u201d Cf. Massachusetts v. E.P.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">549 U.S.\n\n497</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521 (2007) (concluding that potential side effects of climate change qualified as an\n\nactual injury, sufficient to confer Massachusetts with standing to sue the EPA for failing\n\nto regulate greenhouse gas emissions); Tex.

That Graham eventually won the election and that\n\nGonzalez returned the campaign contributions does not render the injury hypothetical. At\n\nbest, these are facts that relate to the merits of Graham\u2019s case, not whether she suffered\n\nany injury. We conclude that Graham suffered an injury-in-fact.\n\n        Additionally, Gonzalez\u2019s conduct is fairly traceable to Graham\u2019s injury. There is no\n\nneed to show the exact responsibility the defendant bears for the alleged injuries, so long\n\nas a plaintiff can trace these injuries to the defendant\u2019s conduct. Heckman, 369 S.W.3d\n\nat 157. Here, Gonzalez\u2019s unlawful campaign finance activities violated Graham\u2019s interest\n\nin ensuring the election was validly conducted. We therefore conclude Graham has\n\ndemonstrated this element of standing.\n\n        To summarize, we conclude that Graham has demonstrated an injury-in-fact and\n\ncausation. 2 Therefore, we further conclude that Graham has standing to bring the\n\n\n        2  Gonzalez does not challenge the redressability component of standing.

Analysis\n\n       Gonzalez and Graham dispute whether the TCPA applies to Graham\u2019s claim.\n\nNonetheless, for purposes of our analysis, we will assume without deciding that the TCPA\n\napplies.\n\n       The second step of the TCPA requires us to examine whether Graham has\n\nestablished through clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential\n\nelement of her claim. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.005(c); In re Lipsky,\n\n460 S.W.3d at 590. To succeed on a \u00a7 253.131 claim, a plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant knowingly made or accepted a campaign contribution or made a campaign\n\nexpenditure in violation of Chapter 253 of the election code. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 253.131(a). To be entitled to damages, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the\n\ncontribution or expenditure was made in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s candidacy or in\n\nsupport of the defendant\u2019s candidacy. Id. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c).\n\n       1.     Knowingly Made or Accepted a Campaign Contribution or Expenditure\n\n       A claimant is not required to show that the candidate knowingly violated Chapter\n\n253 of the election code. Osterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 38. Rather, \u201c\u2018knowingly\u2019 applies only to\n\nwhether a person is making a \u2018campaign contribution\u2019 or \u2018campaign expenditure.\u2019\u201d Id. at\n\n39.

One of these reports covered the period of July 1,\n\n2021, through December 31, 2021. In this report, Gonzalez reported receiving\n\n\u201cPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\u201d in the amount of $700 and making \u201cPOLITICAL\n\nEXPENDITURES\u201d in the amount of $4,000. Gonzalez described the purpose of the\n\nexpenditures as \u201clegal representation to try to become a candidate after [his] application\n\nwas rejected.\u201d See id. Gonzalez swore, \u201cunder penalty of perjury, that the . . . report is\n\ntrue and correct and includes all information required to be reported by [Gonzalez] under\n\nTitle 15, Election Code.\u201d See In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d at 591 (holding that circumstantial\n\nevidence can be used to establish a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case under the TCPA). Based\n\non this, we conclude that Graham provided clear and specific evidence that Gonzalez\n\nknowingly made or accepted a campaign contribution or expenditure.\n\n       2.     Violated Chapter 253 of the Election Code\n\n       Graham specifically alleged that Gonzalez\u2019s expenditures and contributions\n\nviolated \u00a7 253.031 of the Texas Election Code. This statute prohibits candidates from\n\n\u201caccept[ing] a campaign contribution or mak[ing] or authoriz[ing] a campaign expenditure\n\nat a time when a campaign treasurer appointment for the candidate is not in effect.\u201d TEX.\n\nELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.031(a) (entitled \u201cContribution and Expenditure Without Campaign\n\n\n                                             16\n\fTreasurer Prohibited\u201d).\n\n       Attached to Graham\u2019s response was a copy of Gonzalez\u2019s campaign treasurer\n\nappointment. The document indicated that Gonzalez made the appointment on January\n\n28, 2022, it was received by the TEC on February 1, 2022, and it was processed by the\n\nTEC on February 7, 2022. However, as noted above, the record indicates that Gonzalez\n\nboth accepted campaign contributions and made campaign expenditures between July\n\n1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Thus, the record affirmatively indicates that Gonzalez\n\n\u201caccept[ed] a campaign contribution or ma[de] . . . a campaign expenditure at a time when\n\na campaign treasurer appointment for the candidate [was] not in effect.\u201d See id.\n\n       Gonzalez argues that he relied on advice promulgated on the Texas Ethics\n\nCommission\u2019s website \u201cand believed that filing a campaign treasurer\u2019s appointment was\n\nunnecessary.\u201d But, as already discussed above, to demonstrate a prima facie case,\n\nGraham was not required to show that Gonzalez knowingly violated the law, just that he\n\nknowingly accepted a campaign contribution or made a campaign expenditure. See\n\nOsterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 38. We conclude that Graham met her burden to demonstrate\n\nthis element by clear and specific evidence.\n\n       3.     Damages\n\n       A claimant\u2019s entitlement to damages is determined based on whether the\n\ncontribution or expenditure is \u201cin support of a candidate\u201d or \u201cin opposition to a candidate.\u201d\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. \u00a7 253.131(b), (c). Gonzalez argues that he was never a candidate\n\nbecause his ballot application was rejected, and \u00a7 253.131 therefore cannot support\n\nGraham\u2019s claims. We disagree. \u201cCandidate\u201d is defined in Title 15 of the election code as\n\n\n                                             17\n\f\u201ca person who knowingly and willingly takes affirmative action for the purpose of gaining\n\nnomination or election to public office or for the purpose of satisfying financial obligations\n\nincurred by the person in connection with the campaign for nomination or election.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 251.001(1). As examples of an \u201caffirmative action\u201d one might take to be a candidate,\n\nthe election code lists, inter alia, \u201cthe filing of an application for a place on a ballot\u201d and\n\n\u201cthe soliciting or accepting of a campaign contribution or the making of a campaign\n\nexpenditure.\u201d Id. \u00a7 251.001(1)(B), (G).\n\n       Here, it is undisputed that Gonzalez filed an application to run against Graham for\n\nthe position of County Chair for the Cameron County Republican Party. We have also\n\ndetermined that the evidence is sufficient to show that he accepted campaign\n\ncontributions and made campaign expenditures. Therefore, we conclude that Gonzalez\n\nwas a candidate for purposes of \u00a7 253.131. See id. \u00a7 251.001(1)(B), (G).\n\n       Graham has made a prima facie showing that, because Gonzalez accepted\n\ncampaign contributions and made campaign expenditures, Graham, as the opposing\n\ncandidate whose name appeared on the ballot, is entitled to receive statutory damages\n\nin the amount of \u201ctwice the value of the unlawful contribution or expenditure\u201d and\n\n\u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the suit.\u201d See id. \u00a7 253.131(b), (d). Graham further\n\nprovided evidence, in the form of Gonzalez\u2019s campaign finance reports, to demonstrate\n\nthe specific value of the unlawful contributions and expenditures for which she seeks to\n\nrecover. We conclude that Graham has provided clear and specific evidence of this\n\nelement.3\n\n\n       3 Gonzalez argues that awarding Graham damages would constitute a windfall, as Graham has\n\nalready won the election, she spent no money on her campaign, and it is Gonzalez who has suffered by\n                                                18\n\fC.      Conclusion\n\n        In sum, Graham has demonstrated a prima facie case for her \u00a7 253.131 claim with\n\nclear and specific evidence, and we therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndenying Gonzalez\u2019s motion to dismiss. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 27.005(c).\n\n                              IV.     CONSTITUTIONALITY OF \u00a7 253.131\n\n        Finally, Gonzalez contends that, as applied to him, \u00a7 253.131 violates his First and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights. See U.S. CONST. amends. I, XIV. Gonzalez argued to the\n\ntrial court that the TCPA applied to Graham\u2019s cause of action because it was based on or\n\nbrought in response to his exercise of his First Amendment rights. However, he did not\n\nargue that \u00a7 253.131 was unconstitutional as it applied to him because it violated his First\n\nor Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n        The TCPA is not synonymous with the First Amendment.

Hernandez brings his civil action under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. For the\n\nreasons below, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and\n\nDENIES Hernandez\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38. 1\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         Hernandez was prosecuted in the Western District of Texas for possession with the intent\n\nto distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. W.D. Tex. 4:11-\n\ncr-442 (Tex.) ECF 16. He was found guilty and is incarcerated at the Fort Worth Federal\n\nCorrectional Institution. Tex. ECF 94 at 1; see ECF 52 at 3. On February 5, 2014, Hernandez sent\n\n\n\n1\n  Unless otherwise indicated, the formatting of quoted materials has been modified throughout this opinion, for\nexample, by omitting internal quotation marks and citations, and by incorporating emphases, changes to capitalization,\nand other bracketed alterations therein. All pincites to documents filed on the docket are to the automatically generated\nECF Page ID number that appears at the top of each page.\n\n                                                           1\n\fa letter to the EOUSA \u201crequesting access to any records about me\u201d maintained by the EOUSA,\n\nciting FOIA and the Privacy Act. ECF 13-3 at 10. The Office passed Hernandez\u2019s letter on to the\n\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas (USAO/TXW). Id. at 3.\n\n       A paralegal with the USAO/TXW was responsible for locating records potentially\n\nresponsive to Hernandez\u2019s request. In a form attached to a letter sent from the EOUSA to\n\nHernandez, the paralegal indicated that she had located 459 pages of potentially responsive\n\ndocuments: 400 pages of public records, 21 pages of grand jury transcripts, 17 pages of\n\ncorrespondence, 13 pages of attorney work product, and 8 pages originating from the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (DEA). ECF 15 at 18\u201321. She determined that the public records and grand\n\njury transcripts were non-releasable, but she sent the remaining pages of correspondence, attorney\n\nwork product, and DEA documents to the EOUSA. ECF 15 at 21; ECF 19-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20136. By her count,\n\nshe sent 38 pages. ECF 19-1 \u00b6 5. The EOUSA then transferred the 8 pages of DEA documents\n\nback to the DEA, id., leaving 30 pages consisting of correspondence and attorney work-product,\n\nECF 19 at 3\u20134. The EOUSA determined that only 12 of those pages were responsive. Id.\n\n       As to the 12 pages deemed responsive to his request, the EOUSA notified Hernandez that\n\nthe office was fully releasing 4 pages, partially releasing 1 page, and fully withholding 7 pages\n\nbased on FOIA exemptions. ECF 15 at 14\u201315. Hernandez administratively appealed the EOUSA\u2019s\n\ndetermination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). Id. at 24. Citing the USAO/TXW\u2019s\n\nform, Hernandez sought production of the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work\n\nproduct that the USAO/TXW had located. Id. Although OIP received Hernandez\u2019s filing, ECF 13-\n\n3 at 20, the office never notified him of any decision on his timely appeal, ECF 1 \u00b6 16.\n\n       Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, alleging that Defendants violated FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act by failing to produce all records to which he is entitled. ECF 1 \u00b6 11. The Parties\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fthereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF 13; ECF 15. In partially resolving these\n\nmotions, this Court held that the grand jury transcripts were properly withheld, but the Court could\n\nnot determine whether the 18 pages of purportedly nonresponsive correspondence and attorney\n\nwork product were appropriately withheld by the EOUSA. ECF 25 at 13, 15. So, Defendants were\n\nordered to submit those 18 pages for in camera review. Id. at 17. Rather than submit the 18 pages\n\nto the Court for in camera review, however, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and\n\nopted to release the 18 pages to Hernandez. ECF 26 at 1.\n\n       The EOUSA immediately faced a problem when releasing these previously withheld\n\ndocuments. In searching for the key \u201c18 pages,\u201d the EOUSA could find \u201conly 15 pages that were\n\nwithheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\u201d and was \u201cunable to determine why it previously\n\nbelieved that it had withheld 18 pages.\u201d ECF 26 at 1. But \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the EOUSA released\n\nthose 15 pages in full. Id. Hernandez took issue with this supplemental production. He argued that\n\nthe EOUSA provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201c18 pages\u201d initially withheld\n\nand the 15 pages eventually produced, and further protested that these documents \u201cfeatured no\n\ncorrespondence or attorney work product\u201d as the EOUSA claimed. ECF 27 at 2\u20133. To\n\n\u201cinvestigat[e] the alleged discrepancy,\u201d the EOUSA indicated that it would reprocess the\n\nresponsive documents, ECF 28 at 1; ECF 29 at 1, and the Parties moved for summary judgment\n\nshortly thereafter, ECF 35; ECF 38.\n\n       After the EOUSA reprocessed the records, there was still one page unaccounted for.\n\nDefendants assert that when the EOUSA initially requested responsive documents from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, it had received only 37 pages\u2014not 38 pages, as listed on the initial form. ECF 35-\n\n2 at 2. Defendants dismiss this discrepancy as a \u201ctypographical error\u201d or a potentially \u201clost\u201d page.\n\nId. Defendants further represent that, when the EOUSA requested responsive records a second\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftime for the purpose of reprocessing, the USAO/TXW once again transferred 37 pages. ECF 35-1\n\nat 4\u20135. Excepting the 8 pages transferred to the DEA, the entire set of 29 pages were released to\n\nHernandez (16 pages in full, 13 pages in part). ECF 35-1 at 5; ECF 35-2 at 7\u20138. With this\n\nreprocessing and release completed, Defendants assert that they have adequately searched for\n\nrecords responsive to Hernandez\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he is\n\nentitled. ECF 35-1 at 3.\n\n        In his cross motion, Hernandez does not contest the adequacy of the search that the EOUSA\n\nconducted during reprocessing, nor does he dispute the bases for the office\u2019s partial withholding\n\nof 13 pages under FOIA exemptions. He only takes issue with the gap between the number of\n\ndocuments that the EOUSA initially deemed to be unresponsive (18) and the number that the\n\nOffice later released to him (15) before it decided to reprocess the entire batch of documents.\n\nECF 38 at 4\u20136. Hernandez asks this Court to \u201center summary judgment in [his] favor and order\n\nthat the Defendant surrender the original 18-pages or provide a cogent sworn explanation of their\n\nfailure to do so.\u201d Id. at 12.\n\n        The Court had questions about the \u201cclear inconsistency (regarding both number and nature)\n\nbetween the 15 documents that EOUSA produced to Hernandez in response to this Court\u2019s first in\n\ncamera review order and the 18 documents that EOUSA originally deemed non-responsive to\n\nHernandez\u2019s request.\u201d ECF 45 at 4. As such, this Court ordered the EOUSA to submit for in camera\n\nreview (1) the full set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the USAO/TXW when\n\nthe office first referred Hernandez\u2019s request to that jurisdiction; and (2) the full set of documents\n\nthat the EOUSA obtained from the USAO/TXW for reprocessing. Id. at 5. These two sets of\n\ndocuments were submitted, received, and reviewed in camera. The Court now resolves the cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The sole issue at the center of these cross motions is a narrow one. Hernandez only asks\n\nthis Court to determine whether Defendants have \u201csurrend[ered] the original 18-pages or\n\nprovide[d] a cogent sworn explanation of their failure to do so.\u201d ECF 38 at 12. The Court now\n\nconcludes that they have.\n\n       The Court has reviewed the set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, the set of documents that were later reprocessed, and the sworn declaration\n\naccompanying Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion that explains the USAO/TXW\u2019s initial\n\nerror. See ECF 35-2 at 2\u20133. Based on this record, the Court finds that the EOUSA obtained 37\n\npages from the USAO/TXW when it first referred Hernandez\u2019s records request (not 38 pages, as\n\nindicated on the office\u2019s initial form). Those 37 pages received from the USAO/TXW match the\n\n37 pages that were later reprocessed. Excluding the 8 pages transferred to the DEA during both\n\ninitial processing and reprocessing leaves two sets of the same 29 pages. Thus, whatever set of \u201c18\n\npages\u201d the EOUSA deemed nonresponsive during its initial processing of 29 pages must be part\n\nof the second set of 29 pages that were reprocessed because the two sets are identical. And because\n\nthese 29 pages have now been produced to Plaintiff in full or in part, the contested \u201c18 pages\u201d\n\nmust have been surrendered\u2014there are simply no other documents to find, review, or turn over.\n\nTo the extent that, given the partial redactions, some information may have been withheld from\n\nthese documents, Hernandez does not contest the scope of the EOUSA\u2019s search during\n\nreprocessing or its bases for redaction. See generally ECF 38. Thus, with the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nnow indisputably surrendered or cogently accounted for via sworn testimony, see ECF 35-2 at 2,\n\nthe Court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The record establishes that the EOUSA made a mistake. The first set of 37 pages is identical\n\nto the second, which means the EOUSA mischaracterized or miscounted the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nwhen it received the first set of documents from the USAO/TXW. The Court understands\n\nHernandez\u2019s frustration that the EOUSA \u201ccannot explain th[is] discrepancy.\u201d ECF 26-1 at 1. But\n\nthe EOUSA\u2019s error does not change the fact that Hernandez has now received all materials\n\nresponsive to his request, with some documents subject to only partial redactions (which\n\nHernandez does not challenge). The Court is satisfied that Defendants have adequately searched\n\nfor records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he\n\nis entitled.\n\n        Because Defendants have shouldered their burden under FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and DENIES Hernandez\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38.

Hernandez administratively appealed the EOUSA\u2019s\n\ndetermination to the DOJ Office of Information Policy (OIP). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 24</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Citing the USAO/TXW\u2019s\n\nform, Hernandez sought production of the full 30 pages of correspondence and attorney work\n\nproduct that the USAO/TXW had located. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Although OIP received Hernandez\u2019s filing, ECF 13-\n\n3 at 20, the office never notified him of any decision on his timely appeal, ECF 1 \u00b6 16.\n\n       Hernandez sued the DOJ and the EOUSA, alleging that Defendants violated FOIA and the\n\nPrivacy Act by failing to produce all records to which he is entitled. ECF 1 \u00b6 11. The Parties\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fthereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF 13; ECF 15. In partially resolving these\n\nmotions, this Court held that the grand jury transcripts were properly withheld, but the Court could\n\nnot determine whether the 18 pages of purportedly nonresponsive correspondence and attorney\n\nwork product were appropriately withheld by the EOUSA. ECF 25 at 13, 15. So, Defendants were\n\nordered to submit those 18 pages for in camera review. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 17</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rather than submit the 18 pages\n\nto the Court for in camera review, however, the EOUSA reconsidered its withholding decision and\n\nopted to release the 18 pages to Hernandez. ECF 26 at 1.\n\n       The EOUSA immediately faced a problem when releasing these previously withheld\n\ndocuments. In searching for the key \u201c18 pages,\u201d the EOUSA could find \u201conly 15 pages that were\n\nwithheld on grounds of non-responsiveness\u201d and was \u201cunable to determine why it previously\n\nbelieved that it had withheld 18 pages.\u201d ECF 26 at 1. But \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d the EOUSA released\n\nthose 15 pages in full. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Hernandez took issue with this supplemental production. He argued that\n\nthe EOUSA provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201c18 pages\u201d initially withheld\n\nand the 15 pages eventually produced, and further protested that these documents \u201cfeatured no\n\ncorrespondence or attorney work product\u201d as the EOUSA claimed. ECF 27 at 2\u20133. To\n\n\u201cinvestigat[e] the alleged discrepancy,\u201d the EOUSA indicated that it would reprocess the\n\nresponsive documents, ECF 28 at 1; ECF 29 at 1, and the Parties moved for summary judgment\n\nshortly thereafter, ECF 35; ECF 38.\n\n       After the EOUSA reprocessed the records, there was still one page unaccounted for.\n\nDefendants assert that when the EOUSA initially requested responsive documents from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, it had received only 37 pages\u2014not 38 pages, as listed on the initial form. ECF 35-\n\n2 at 2. Defendants dismiss this discrepancy as a \u201ctypographical error\u201d or a potentially \u201clost\u201d page.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Defendants further represent that, when the EOUSA requested responsive records a second\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ftime for the purpose of reprocessing, the USAO/TXW once again transferred 37 pages. ECF 35-1\n\nat 4\u20135. Excepting the 8 pages transferred to the DEA, the entire set of 29 pages were released to\n\nHernandez (16 pages in full, 13 pages in part). ECF 35-1 at 5; ECF 35-2 at 7\u20138. With this\n\nreprocessing and release completed, Defendants assert that they have adequately searched for\n\nrecords responsive to Hernandez\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he is\n\nentitled. ECF 35-1 at 3.\n\n        In his cross motion, Hernandez does not contest the adequacy of the search that the EOUSA\n\nconducted during reprocessing, nor does he dispute the bases for the office\u2019s partial withholding\n\nof 13 pages under FOIA exemptions. He only takes issue with the gap between the number of\n\ndocuments that the EOUSA initially deemed to be unresponsive (18) and the number that the\n\nOffice later released to him (15) before it decided to reprocess the entire batch of documents.\n\nECF 38 at 4\u20136. Hernandez asks this Court to \u201center summary judgment in [his] favor and order\n\nthat the Defendant surrender the original 18-pages or provide a cogent sworn explanation of their\n\nfailure to do so.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 12</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n        The Court had questions about the \u201cclear inconsistency (regarding both number and nature)\n\nbetween the 15 documents that EOUSA produced to Hernandez in response to this Court\u2019s first in\n\ncamera review order and the 18 documents that EOUSA originally deemed non-responsive to\n\nHernandez\u2019s request.\u201d ECF 45 at 4. As such, this Court ordered the EOUSA to submit for in camera\n\nreview (1) the full set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the USAO/TXW when\n\nthe office first referred Hernandez\u2019s request to that jurisdiction; and (2) the full set of documents\n\nthat the EOUSA obtained from the USAO/TXW for reprocessing. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 5</span><pre class=\"inline\">. These two sets of\n\ndocuments were submitted, received, and reviewed in camera. The Court now resolves the cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       The sole issue at the center of these cross motions is a narrow one. Hernandez only asks\n\nthis Court to determine whether Defendants have \u201csurrend[ered] the original 18-pages or\n\nprovide[d] a cogent sworn explanation of their failure to do so.\u201d ECF 38 at 12. The Court now\n\nconcludes that they have.\n\n       The Court has reviewed the set of documents that the EOUSA initially obtained from the\n\nUSAO/TXW, the set of documents that were later reprocessed, and the sworn declaration\n\naccompanying Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion that explains the USAO/TXW\u2019s initial\n\nerror. See ECF 35-2 at 2\u20133. Based on this record, the Court finds that the EOUSA obtained 37\n\npages from the USAO/TXW when it first referred Hernandez\u2019s records request (not 38 pages, as\n\nindicated on the office\u2019s initial form). Those 37 pages received from the USAO/TXW match the\n\n37 pages that were later reprocessed. Excluding the 8 pages transferred to the DEA during both\n\ninitial processing and reprocessing leaves two sets of the same 29 pages. Thus, whatever set of \u201c18\n\npages\u201d the EOUSA deemed nonresponsive during its initial processing of 29 pages must be part\n\nof the second set of 29 pages that were reprocessed because the two sets are identical. And because\n\nthese 29 pages have now been produced to Plaintiff in full or in part, the contested \u201c18 pages\u201d\n\nmust have been surrendered\u2014there are simply no other documents to find, review, or turn over.\n\nTo the extent that, given the partial redactions, some information may have been withheld from\n\nthese documents, Hernandez does not contest the scope of the EOUSA\u2019s search during\n\nreprocessing or its bases for redaction. See generally ECF 38. Thus, with the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nnow indisputably surrendered or cogently accounted for via sworn testimony, see ECF 35-2 at 2,\n\nthe Court\u2019s inquiry is at an end.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f        The record establishes that the EOUSA made a mistake. The first set of 37 pages is identical\n\nto the second, which means the EOUSA mischaracterized or miscounted the \u201c18 pages\u201d at issue\n\nwhen it received the first set of documents from the USAO/TXW. The Court understands\n\nHernandez\u2019s frustration that the EOUSA \u201ccannot explain th[is] discrepancy.\u201d ECF 26-1 at 1. But\n\nthe EOUSA\u2019s error does not change the fact that Hernandez has now received all materials\n\nresponsive to his request, with some documents subject to only partial redactions (which\n\nHernandez does not challenge). The Court is satisfied that Defendants have adequately searched\n\nfor records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request and have produced all the records to which he\n\nis entitled.\n\n        Because Defendants have shouldered their burden under FOIA and the Privacy Act, the\n\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ECF 35, and DENIES Hernandez\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, ECF 38.

For the reasons below, both\n\nmotions are granted.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       Summarized below are the factual allegations and procedural history in this case.\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       As alleged in his amended complaint, plaintiff traveled with a friend to Washington,\n\nD.C., to attend the Stop the Steal rally, on January 6, 2021, but left the rally more than halfway\n\nthrough former President Trump\u2019s speech to return to his car. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25\u201327. While sitting in a\n\nparking garage in his car, plaintiff received a call from his brother informing him that \u201cpeople\n\nwere just waking [sic] into the capitol building and the police are not doing anything.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27.\n\nPlaintiff then made his way to the Capitol Building to \u201cnews gather\u201d and \u201carrived on the\n\noutskirts of the building close to Peace Monument around 2:48.\u201d Id. \u00b6 28. One minute later, at\n\n2:49 PM, plaintiff received an alert on his cell phone regarding Mayor Bowser\u2019s curfew order to\n\nbe inside by 6 PM. Id. Plaintiff claims that \u201c[e]veryone lost cell service\u201d because this \u201cmass text\n\n[was] sent to everyone at the same time.\u201d Id. \u00b6 33.\n\n       Plaintiff admits that he went up the stairs to the West Terrace, \u201cto find his friend and to\n\nnews gather,\u201d and also that he entered the Capitol Building at 3:00 PM. Id. \u00b6 29. By plaintiff\u2019s\n\ndescription, \u201c[t]here were plenty of Police already there . . . quietly watching hordes of protesters\n\ncome through.\u201d Id. Plaintiff further admits that he \u201cwent in a side room to see if he could get\n\nout through there, he could not and proceeded to video as thousands of more people kept coming\n                                                  2\n\ftowards the building.\u201d Id. Plaintiff claims that he \u201cavoid[ed] any altercations with officers\u201d and\n\n\u201cwas in the building for a total of less than 3 minutes and only filmed in the building.\u201d Id. \u00b6 30.\n\nAs he left, plaintiff \u201cwas scared to go down the stairs, cops were spraying the top of the\n\nstairs . . . . He attempted to make it to the stairs to exit and had to avoid being sprayed by\n\nPolice.\u201d Id. He eventually left the building and walked back to George Washington University.\n\nId. \u00b6 31.\n\n        Plaintiff admits that he posted videos from January 6, 2021 on Instagram and\n\nacknowledges the seriousness of the criminal conduct occurring that day at the Capitol, stating\n\nhe \u201c[t]hen was worried for 8 months that one day the government would come after him like a\n\nterrorist.\u201d Id. \u00b6 32. On some date not disclosed in his pleadings, plaintiff was arrested at a\n\nlocation also not disclosed in his pleadings, which arrest he describes as being \u201cswatted and hit\n\nvary [sic] hard with the door in the face. His health has not been the same, he should have never\n\nbeen arrested[,] [l]et alone pre-dawn raided by a 35-member swat force.\u201d Id. Plaintiff claims\n\nthat he \u201cwas told by his arresting officer Timothy Donovan that he was arrested on that particular\n\nday because it was the day after the J6 Committee hearing,\u201d and that the government \u201cchose to\n\nblow Daniel [Christmann] in the media, and timed it specifically, to end his political career.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 33.\n\n        Review of the public docket of this Court reveals that plaintiff was charged, in July 2021,\n\nwith violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1752(a)(1)\u2013(2) and 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5104(e)(2)(D) and (G), due to his\n\ncriminal conduct on January 6, 2021, and pleaded guilty in November 2022 to violating 40\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 5104(e)(2)(G) (Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building). See\n\nUnited States v. Christmann, 21-cr-502 (CKK), Statement of Facts at 18, ECF No. 1-1; id, Plea\n\nAgreement, ECF No. 45. He is awaiting sentencing.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f         B.       Procedural Background\n\n         Plaintiff Daniel Christmann initiated this action in February 2022 against District of\n\nColumbia Mayor Muriel Bowser by filing a complaint in Superior Court. Superior Court\n\nDocuments at 1. In an amended complaint, filed in Superior Court in July 2022, plaintiff\n\ndropped the Mayor as a defendant, naming as a defendant only the Office of the Attorney\n\nGeneral for the District of Columbia (\u201cOAG\u201d), and asserting federal claims. Id. at 36\u201359. OAG\n\nremoved the case to this Court and moved to dismiss the amended complaint originally filed in\n\nSuperior Court. See generally Not. of Removal; OAG\u2019s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 4. In response,\n\nplaintiff requested to amend the complaint and case caption to name the District of Columbia and\n\nthe USCP as defendants, rather than OAG. See Pl.\u2019s Response to OAG\u2019s Mot. Dismiss and\n\nApplication to Amend Complaint and Caption, ECF No. 6. Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the case\n\ncaption was granted, over defendant\u2019s opposition. Minute Order (Sept. 7, 2022). Consequently,\n\nthe OAG was terminated as a defendant in this case, and the District and USCP were added as\n\nnamed defendants. Id.\n\n         After entering a guilty plea in his criminal case pending in this Court, plaintiff filed, in\n\nJanuary 2023, a second amended complaint against the District and USCP, asserting claims of\n\n\u201cmalice interference,\u201d slander, negligence under the FAAA, and violations of his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 35\u201343. 1 As the factual basis for these\n\nclaims, plaintiff alleges that the District issued no dispersal order to protestors during the events\n\n\n\n\n1\n          Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint was docketed without written consent from the opposing party or\nleave to file an amendment granted by this Court, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), but no\nobjection has been lodged to consideration of plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint on that procedural basis and,\ngiven plaintiff\u2019s pro se status, the pending motions to dismiss will be considered rather than striking the second\namended complaint for improper filing.\n\n                                                          4\n\fon January 6, 2021, id. \u00b6 30, and that \u201c[i]f he knew it was illegal or that deadly force was being\n\nused he would have never entered Capitol Grounds,\u201d id. \u00b6 34.\n\n         As relief, plaintiff first \u201cdemands the Mayor or District Representative to take into\n\naccount that the timing of his arrival (2:48pm) to the Capitol Complex and leaving the building,\n\nand city. . . . [was] in total Compliance with the Mayors [sic] orders. There were no other laws\n\nthat were knowingly broken.\u201d 2 Id. \u00b6 44. Plaintiff further requests that the \u201cAttorney General for\n\nthe District of Columbia demand Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and the Department of Justice\n\ndismiss [his criminal] case. They must notify the Judge and Prosecution that they failed to issue\n\ndispersal orders[,] . . . state that my arrest was an unlawful arrest as no dispersal orders were\n\ngiven[,] . . . [a]nd [provide] a $450,000 settlement to deal with the stigma of being labeled a\n\nCapitol Storming White Terrorist and having a litany of articles on the internet they can never\n\nget rid of[,] [p]lus the cost of curing my new sleep issues from the 6a.m. head trauma.\u201d Id. \u00b6 46.\n\nPlaintiff then cautions that if the District fails to settle this action he \u201cwill continue to seek relief\n\nof $5 million.\u201d Id. \u00b6 45.\n\n         In March 2023, the District moved to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6), see DC\u2019s MTD at 1, and, in April 2023, the USCP moved to dismiss\n\nplaintiff\u2019s claims, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), or, in the\n\nalternative, for summary judgment under Rule 56, see USCP\u2019s Mem. Supp. MTD (\u201cUSCP\u2019s\n\nMem.\u201d) at 7\u201314, ECF No. 23-1. 3 The defendants\u2019 motions are ripe for resolution.\n\n\n\n2\n          Plaintiff\u2019s assertion in his second amended complaint that he did not knowingly violate any laws on\nJanuary 6, 2021 runs completely counter to his guilty plea entered in his criminal case, and the Statement of Offense\nentered with his Plea Agreement, which states that he \u201cwillfully and knowingly entered the U.S. Capitol Building,\u201d\nthat \u201c[a]t the time that he entered, he knew that he did not have permission to do so,\u201d and that he \u201cwillfully and\nknowingly paraded, demonstrated, or picketed\u201d while inside the Capitol Building. See United States v. Christmann,\n21-cr-502 (CKK), Statement of Offense at 4, ECF No. 44.\n3\n          The USCP also moved to dismiss under 12(b)(4) for failure to properly effectuate service, USCP\u2019s Mem. at\n4\u20135, but this ground for dismissal need not be considered since dismissal is based on other grounds.\n\n                                                         5\n\fII.     LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        A. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 12(b)(6)\n\n        A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief,\u201d and \u201c[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2), (d)(1). The \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d requirement is not stringent. See Skinner\n\nv. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 529\u201330 (2011); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\n\nIts purpose is \u201cto \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which\n\nit rests.\u2019\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (alteration in original accepted and citation omitted).\n\n        At the same time, to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the \u201ccomplaint must\n\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n\nface.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted). A claim is facially\n\nplausible when the plaintiff pleads facts that are more than \u201cmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s\n\nliability\u201d and that \u201callow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\n\nfor the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. (citation omitted); see also Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham,\n\n798 F.3d 1119, 1129 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\u201cPlausibility requires more than a sheer possibility that a\n\ndefendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted)). \u201c[A] complaint\n\nsurvives a motion to dismiss even if there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by the\n\ndefendant and the other advanced by the plaintiff, both of which are plausible.\u201d VoteVets Action\n\nFund v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affs., 992 F.3d 1097, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (alterations in\n\noriginal accepted and citation omitted).\n\n        In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must consider the whole complaint,\n\naccepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, \u201ceven if doubtful in fact,\u201d and\n\nconstruing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fAtchley v. AstraZeneca UK Ltd., 22 F.4th 204, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2022). A court, however, does not\n\n\u201caccept inferences drawn by a plaintiff if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in\n\nthe complaint.\u201d Nurriddin v. Bolden, 818 F.3d 751, 756 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (alterations in original\n\naccepted and citation omitted); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (\u201cWhile legal conclusions can\n\nprovide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.\u201d). In\n\ndetermining whether a complaint fails to state a claim, a court may consider only the facts\n\nalleged in the complaint and \u201cany documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint\n\nand matters of which the court may take judicial notice.\u201d N. Am. Butterfly Ass\u2019n v. Wolf, 977\n\nF.3d 1244, 1249 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (alterations in original accepted and citation omitted).\n\n       B. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n\n       \u201cArticle III of the Constitution prescribes that \u2018[f]ederal courts are courts of limited subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction\u2019 and \u2018ha[ve] the power to decide only those cases over which Congress grants\n\njurisdiction.\u2019\u201d Bronner ex rel. Am. Stud. Ass\u2019n v. Duggan, 962 F.3d 596, 602 (D.C. Cir. 2020)\n\n(alterations in original) (quoting Al-Zahrani v. Rodriguez, 669 F.3d 315, 317 (D.C. Cir. 2012));\n\nsee also Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 256 (2013) (\u201c\u2018Federal courts are courts of limited\n\njurisdiction,\u2019 possessing \u2018only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\u2019\u201d (quoting\n\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994))). Absent subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over a case, the court must dismiss it. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500,\n\n506\u201307 (2006) (citing Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n\n       To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the plaintiff\n\nbears the burden of demonstrating the court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim at issue.\n\nArpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\n\nU.S. 555, 561 (1992)). When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), the court must\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fdetermine jurisdictional questions by accepting as true all uncontroverted material factual\n\nallegations contained in the complaint and \u201cconstru[ing] the complaint liberally, granting\n\nplaintiff[s] the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u201d Hemp Indus.\n\nAss\u2019n v. DEA, 36 F.4th 278, 281 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (second alteration in original) (quoting Am. Nat\u2019l\n\nIns. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). The court may also, \u201c[a]s necessary, []\n\ncull additional facts from other parts of the record.\u201d West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 1228, 1231 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2017) (citing Settles v.

Cir. 2005) (in\n\ndeciding subject matter jurisdiction, courts may \u201cconsider[] facts developed in the record beyond\n\nthe complaint\u201d)).\n\n       C. Pro Se Pleadings\n\n       In applying these standards to pleadings filed by pro se litigants, the complaint must be\n\nconsidered \u201cin light of all filings, including filings responsive to a motion to dismiss.\u201d Johnson\n\nv. District of Columbia, 927 F.3d 539, 541 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Brown v. Whole Foods Mkt.\n\nGrp., Inc., 789 F.3d 146, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nIn addition, a pro se complaint \u201c\u2018is to be liberally construed\u2019 and must be \u2018held to less stringent\n\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u2019\u201d Bowman v.

Nonetheless, a pro se plaintiff is not excused from complying with\n\napplicable procedural rules and \u201cmust plead \u2018factual matter\u2019 that permits the court to infer \u2018more\n\nthan the mere possibility of misconduct.\u2019\u201d Atherton v.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Plaintiff\u2019s claims against each defendant are fatally flawed for multiple reasons, requiring\n\ndismissal under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\n       A.      Plaintiff\u2019s Claims are Inherently Frivolous\n\n       As an initial matter, before addressing the arguments for dismissal made by the\n\ndefendants, plaintiff\u2019s claims are subject to dismissal, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(1), on the grounds that they are fundamentally fanciful. See Roum v. Bush, 461\n\nF. Supp. 2d 40, 46\u201347 (D.D.C. 2006); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) (providing that\n\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any filing fee . . . that may have been paid\u201d a \u201ccourt shall dismiss\u201d a pro se\n\ncomplaint \u201cat any time if the court determines that the action . . . is frivolous or malicious\u201d or\n\n\u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted\u201d). \u201c[F]ederal courts are without power to\n\nentertain claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are so attenuated and unsubstantial as\n\nto be absolutely devoid of merit.\u201d Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 536 (1974) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Complaints lack merit and are generally subject to\n\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) when they transcend characterization as \u201cdoubtful or\n\nquestionable\u201d and are \u201cessentially fictitious.\u201d Best v. Kelly, 39 F.3d 328, 330 (D.C. Cir. 1994)\n\n(citations omitted). Such complaints often allege \u201cbizarre conspiracy theories\u201d or \u201cfantastic\n\ngovernment manipulations.\u201d Id. at 330\u201331; see Gbedemah v. CIA, No. 21-cv-438 (DLF), 2022\n\nWL 855020, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 17, 2022) (\u201c[A] court can invoke Rule 12(b)(1) to dismiss a\n\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint that is \u2018patently insubstantial, presenting no federal question suitable for\n\ndecision.\u2019\u201d (quoting Walsh v. Comey, 118 F. Supp. 3d 22, 25 (D.D.C. 2015)). That is the\n\napparent nature of plaintiff\u2019s allegations here.\n\n       After taking multiple attempts to find the \u201cright\u201d defendants, plaintiff makes sweeping\n\nallegations in his second amended complaint that can only be described as frivolous or fanciful.\n                                                   9\n\fPlaintiff claims that the actions taken by Mayor Bowser to protect the District and government\n\nemployees at the Capitol Building were \u201cdeceitful, and possibly abusive of process.\u201d SAC \u00b6 39.\n\nHe asserts that the \u201cfact that the Mayor hasn\u2019t come forward defending the trespass only type\n\nJanuary 6-er\u2019s[] shows their Curfew Order was deceitful and continues to be negligent by not\n\ncoming forward.\u201d Id. Plaintiff further alleges that the Mayor\u2019s conduct is made more egregious\n\nby unidentified \u201c8 figure settlements for not providing dispersal orders\u201d supposedly entered into\n\nby the District. Id.\n\n       Plaintiff\u2019s complaint then spirals into wholly unsupported allegations and conclusions\n\nabout the catastrophic consequences of defendants\u2019 conduct. He claims that he \u201cwas denied\n\ncollege entry due to the negative covderage [sic], and will eventually be prevented from running\n\nfor office in [New York State], and he intends to be compensated.\u201d Id. \u00b6 45. He asserts that a\n\n$450,000 settlement is warranted to \u201cdeal with the stigma of being labeled a Capitol Storming\n\nWhite Terrorist and having a litany of articles on the internet they can never get rid of.\u201d Id. \u00b6 46.\n\nPlaintiff fails properly to allege, however, how defendants may be found liable for these\n\nhypothetical harms that he claims he has faced or will face.\n\n       This lawsuit is merely an attempt by plaintiff to absolve himself of responsibility for his\n\ncriminal actions on January 6, 2021, and to blame the District and USCP for the consequences of\n\nhis own criminal actions. Plaintiff aims to hold the District liable for not setting an earlier time\n\nthan 6 PM in its curfew order, when an earlier time would supposedly have encouraged him to\n\nleave, rather than unlawfully enter, the Capitol Building. He also seeks to blame the USCP for\n\nnot physically preventing him from entering the Capitol Building, at a time when officers were\n\noverwhelmed by the thousands of rioters forcing entry into the building, and were focused on the\n\nsecurity of government officials and employees being evacuated as rioters made their way\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fthrough the building. Nonetheless, plaintiff makes the absurd assertion that either the District or\n\nUSCP infringed upon any right of plaintiff\u2019s or broke any duty to him when responding to the\n\nemergency situation created by the Capitol Building attack on January 6, 2021. Notwithstanding\n\nthat pro se complaints, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\u201d are held to less stringent standards than\n\nthose applied to lawyer-drafted pleadings, Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94, plaintiff\u2019s complaint\n\ncontains allegations of liability on behalf of the defendants that are so unrealistic that they\n\ndeprive this Court of subject matter jurisdiction and thus may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1).\n\n       B.      USCP\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Must Be Granted\n\n       Set against the absurdity of plaintiff\u2019s claims, defendants also provide a number of\n\ntechnical reasons why each claim must be dismissed. First, plaintiff has failed to state a viable\n\nclaim entitling him to relief against the USCP. See generally SAC; see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6). A complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n\nface\u201d and to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it\n\nrests.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555\u201356. In reviewing a complaint, \u201c[i]t is not the Court\u2019s job to\n\nwade through pages of incoherent gobbledy-gook in search of a single claim that may have\n\nmerit.\u201d Shallal v. Gates, 254 F.R.D. 140, 143 n.6 (D.D.C. 2008).\n\n       Plaintiff fails to provide \u201csimple, concise, and direct\u201d allegations of his claim against the\n\nUSCP. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d). Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s \u201conly factual allegations that name the\n\nCapitol Police are that Capitol Police officers watched him enter the Capitol Building and \u2018said\n\nnothing,\u2019\u201d and \u201cin many parts of the complaint, it is impossible to distinguish the allegations\n\nagainst District officials from the allegations against the Capitol Police.\u201d USCP\u2019s Mem. at 9.\n\nPlaintiff alleges that law enforcement did not issue dispersal orders, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201320, and that\n\npolice were \u201cspraying the stairs of those coming and going and not making any announcements,\u201d\n\nid. \u00b6 30; see also id. \u00b6 42. While these allegations could conceivably be against the USCP, as\n                                                  11\n\fone of the law enforcement agencies responding to the attack on the Capitol, plaintiff has failed\n\nto make clear in his complaint the direct tie between these allegations and the USCP. This\n\nfailure supports the granting of the USCP\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Harris v.\n\nHolder, 885 F. Supp. 2d 390, 398 (D.D.C. 2012) (dismissing a complaint that \u201cutter[ly] fail[s] to\n\nsupport its broad assertions of constitutional violations with factual allegations).\n\n       Plaintiff also fails to identify how his conclusory allegations against the USCP would\n\namount to any violations of his rights alleged in his complaint. As noted by the USCP, plaintiff\n\ndoes not explain which factual allegations in his complaint support his various claims, and,\n\nalthough challenging his arrest for his conduct on January 6 as unconstitutional, \u201cdoes not plead\n\nfacts to demonstrate why the arrest was unconstitutional, or which of his constitutional rights the\n\narrest violated. . . . [or] even identify the law enforcement agency that he alleges arrested him.\u201d\n\nUSCP\u2019s Mem. at 9\u201310.\n\n       Rather than clarify his claims or refute the USCP\u2019s grounds for dismissal, plaintiff makes\n\nthe confusing assertion that his claims are \u201cso absolute the defense is left to disputing this claim\n\nwith technicalities as they cannot lean on facts.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to USCP\u2019s MTD (\u201cPl.\u2019s USCP\n\nOpp\u2019n\u201d) at 2, ECF No. 26. He then adds factual allegations that the USCP and other law\n\nenforcement officers \u201cengaged in a massive deviation from the normal First Amendment\n\nprocedures for which they are so well trained, that a blatant indifference towards first\n\namendment protocol was on full display.\u201d Id. Further, according to plaintiff, \u201c[t]he Capitol\n\nPolice took absolutely no measure to alert the crowd, anywhere near the Plaintiff that this event\n\nreached riot status and illegality of the crowds\u2019 presence, or even alert protestors to go through\n\nmetal detectors,\u201d failures which he claims resulted in deliberate indifference towards his First\n\nAmendment rights. Id. at 4. He then shifts his criticism to the US Attorney\u2019s Office\u2014which is\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fnot named as a defendant in this case\u2014complaining that \u201c[i]t is baffling that a US Attorney\n\nwould question how not issuing a dispersal order could fall under a Monell claim for deliberate\n\nindifference,\u201d id. at 10, and that \u201c[t]he US Attorney\u2019s office continues to be deliberately\n\nindifferent towards first amendment protocol by issuing warrants, and coercing people into\n\ntaking pleas with non-pertaining and possibly fake photographs of signs they allege protestors\n\ntook photos of while entering grounds,\u201d id. at 3.\n\n         \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must make factual allegations that are\n\nneither vague nor conclusory and that cover all the elements that comprise the theory for relief.\u201d\n\nASA Accugrade, Inc. v. Am. Numismatic Ass\u2019n, 370 F. Supp. 2d 213, 215 (D.D.C. 2005) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Plaintiff\u2019s conclusory allegations fail meaningfully to\n\nestablish the elements that would entitle him to relief under any of his purported theories of\n\nliability, including violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights, negligence, \u201cmalice\n\ninterference,\u201d and slander. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not provide the USCP with notice of the\n\nclaims asserted and the grounds on which they rest, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555\u201356, even\n\ntaking into account plaintiff\u2019s opposition, which fails to clarify any of his claims or make any\n\ncognizable legal defense to dismissal, see generally Pl.\u2019s USCP Opp\u2019n. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncomplaint must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim.\n\n         Even if the factual allegations were teased intelligibly together and broadly stretched to\n\nconstrue cognizable legal claims against the USCP that would not warrant dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) or under Rule 12(b)(1) as being fanciful or frivolous, those claims would still fail to\n\nestablish this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction as a legal matter. Plaintiff\u2019s conclusory\n\nassertion that he \u201chas already established more than enough subject matter,\u201d Pl.\u2019s USCP Opp\u2019n\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fat 6, is insufficient to counter the arguments made by the USCP. Dismissal is thus warranted\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) for several additional reasons.\n\n       First, plaintiff\u2019s claims for monetary damages for alleged violations of his First and\n\nFourth Amendment rights are construed as constitutional tort claims against a federal agency\n\nand, as such, are barred by sovereign immunity. See USCP\u2019s Mem. at 10\u201311. \u201cThe United\n\nStates, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued, . . . and the terms of its\n\nconsent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941) (citations omitted); United States v. Mitchell, 463\n\nU.S. 206, 212 (1983) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent,\n\nand that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\u201d). \u201cA waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity \u2018cannot be implied, but must be unequivocally expressed,\u2019\u201d United States v. Mitchell,\n\n445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980) (quoting United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)), and absent an\n\nexpress waiver, \u201csovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from\n\nsuit,\u201d Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994).\n\n       Insofar as plaintiff\u2019s tort claims arise from the violation of his civil rights, sovereign\n\nimmunity bars them. The \u201cUnited States simply has not rendered itself liable . . . for\n\nconstitutional tort claims.\u201d Meyer, 510 U.S. at 478; see Mullen v. Bureau of Prisons, 843 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 112, 116 (D.D.C. 2012) (\u201c[T]he United States has not consented to be sued for\n\nmonetary damages based on a constitutional violation[.]\u201d); Boling v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, 290\n\nF. Supp. 3d 37, 46 (D.D.C. 2017) (\u201cFirst, the law is well established that Congress has not\n\nwaived the United States\u2019 immunity with respect to tort claims arising under the Constitution.\u201d),\n\naff\u2019d, No. 17-5285, 2018 WL 6721354 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 19, 2018). \u201c[A] party bringing suit\n\nagainst the United States bears the burden of proving that the government has unequivocally\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fwaived its immunity.\u201d Tri-state Hosp. Supply Corp. v. United States, 341 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n         Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate in any of his filings that the USCP has waived its\n\nsovereign immunity. He asserts instead that the USCP \u201cdouble[s] down on the obvious\n\nindifferences of that tragic day as they hide behind the protection of sovereign immunity,\u201d which\n\nhe describes as an \u201cunintended vulnerabilit[y] of our justice system.\u201d Pl.\u2019s USCP Opp\u2019n at 2\u20133. 4\n\nYet, plaintiff fails to cite any legal authority indicating that the USCP should be denied sovereign\n\nimmunity. His accusation that the USCP is \u201chiding\u201d behind sovereign immunity simply avoids\n\nthe fact that this federal government entity has not waived immunity, and thus plaintiff\u2019s\n\nconstitutional tort claims must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n\nSchindler Elevator Corp. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 16 F.4th 294, 296 (D.C. Cir. 2021)\n\n(affirming dismissal of complaint against DC Metro Authority for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction based on sovereign immunity not excepted or waived).\n\n         Second, plaintiff\u2019s request for relief is improper in that he seeks a declaratory judgment\n\nvacating his criminal conviction. See SAC \u00b6 46 (\u201cDaniel Christmann seeks relief by, having the\n\nAttorney General for the District of Columbia demand Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and the\n\nDepartment of Justice dismiss Daniel\u2019s case.\u201d). Such a judgment announcing the invalidity of\n\nhis criminal conviction is barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S 477, 486 (1993). Plaintiff\n\naccuses the USCP of \u201cus[ing] tactics to run out the clock just to corrupt justice by hiding behind\n\nvery questionable rulings like Heck v. Humphries,\u201d Pl.\u2019s USCP Opp\u2019n at 3; see also id. at 20\u201323,\n\n\n\n\n4\n         Plaintiff claims that \u201c[t]here is no way the Capitol Police can seek the comforts of Sovereign Immunity\nwhile they are absolutely not protected and can be held liable.\u201d Id. at 19 (citing Tongol v. Usury, 575 F. Supp 409\n(N.D. Cal. 1983)). As the USCP correctly points out, however, the Tongol case cited by plaintiff is \u201cabout\nattorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act, which is not even\nremotely related to constitutional tort claims.\u201d USCP\u2019s Reply at 3, ECF No. 27.\n\n                                                         15\n\fbut Heck is binding and dispositive here. Under Heck, a claimant may not bring a constitutional\n\ntort claim for \u201c\u2018harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render [his] conviction or\n\nsentence invalid\u2019 unless \u2018the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged\n\nby executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or\n\ncalled into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Hill,\n\n74 F.3d 1339, 1340 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting Heck, 512 U.S. at 487) (alteration in original).\n\nNone of the circumstances that would avoid application of Heck apply here, and thus plaintiff\u2019s\n\neffort to challenge his criminal conviction must fail.\n\n       Finally, to the extent plaintiff brings common law tort claims under the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, those claims may not be entertained because he has\n\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The FTCA permits a civil suit for \u201cpersonal injury\n\n. . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government\n\nwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). The FTCA\n\nwaives sovereign immunity \u201c\u2018under circumstances where the United States, if a private person,\n\nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission\n\noccurred.\u2019\u201d Hornbeck Offshore Transp., LLC v. United States, 569 F.3d 506, 508 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1)). Thus, the FTCA renders the United States subject to\n\nsuit for certain\u2014but not all\u2014tort claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 2674, 2679; see, e.g.,\n\nMillbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 52 (2013); Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 6\n\n(1962); Harbury v. Hayden, 522 F.3d 413, 416 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n       The FTCA requires that a plaintiff \u201chave first presented the claim to the appropriate\n\nFederal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by\n\ncertified or registered mail.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). Accordingly, claimants may not sue the\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fUnited States \u201cin federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies,\u201d and\n\nclaimants\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to heed that clear statutory command\u201d warrants dismissal of their claims.\n\nMcNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993); see Henderson v. Ratner, No. 10-5035, 2010\n\nWL 2574175, at *1 (D.C. Cir. June 7, 2010) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of FTCA claim\n\nwhere \u201c[a]ppellant failed to demonstrate that he exhausted his administrative remedies before\n\nfiling suit in the district court\u201d); Abdurrahman v. Engstrom, 168 F. App\u2019x 445, 445 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005) (per curiam) (affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of unexhausted FTCA claim \u201cfor lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction\u201d). As the USCP correctly argues, plaintiff did not file an\n\nadministrative tort claim against the USCP before bringing his suit in federal court. USCP\u2019s\n\nMem. at 14. Plaintiff\u2019s common law tort claims thus may not be pursued through the FTCA, a\n\nfact that further supports dismissal of his suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n\n         C.       DC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Must Also Be Granted\n\n         The District seeks dismissal, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), on grounds\n\nthat plaintiff \u201ccannot maintain this action against the District because he raised no viable\n\nmunicipal liability claim against the District under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 nor under the First\n\nAmendment Assemblies Act (FAAA),\u201d and that his \u201cfailure to plead viable common law claims\n\nand failure to comply with the requirements of D.C. Code \u00a7 12-309 precludes him from pursuing\n\nany common law claims against the District.\u201d DC\u2019s MTD at 1. Instead of engaging with the\n\nDistrict\u2019s legal arguments, plaintiff responds simply by reasserting the facts in his second\n\namended complaint and accusing the District of violating his rights by failing to issue dispersal\n\norders on January 6, 2021, among other conclusory accusations. See generally Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to\n\nDC\u2019s MTD (\u201cPl.\u2019s DC Opp\u2019n\u201d), ECF No. 21; Pl.\u2019s DC Sur-reply, ECF No. 24. 5 For the reasons\n\n\n5\n         Plaintiff filed two separate oppositions to the District\u2019s motion to dismiss, at ECF Nos. 18 and 20, along\nwith an amended Errata, at ECF No. 21, that appears to contain all plaintiff\u2019s arguments against dismissal.\n\n                                                         17\n\fbelow, the District\u2019s motion to dismiss must also be granted for the reasons identified by the\n\nDistrict under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n       First, the District argues that plaintiff has failed to plead any facts that show he suffered a\n\nconstitutional violation at the hands of a District agent or employee for the purposes of 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1983. DC\u2019s Mem. Supp. MTD (\u201cDC\u2019s Mem.\u201d) at 4\u20136, ECF No. 16-1. Although alleging that\n\nhe was sprayed with an unknown substance inside the Capitol Building, plaintiff makes no\n\nallegation indicating \u201cthat any MPD officer sprayed him\u201d or \u201cthat he was seized by any District\n\nemployee.\u201d Id. at 5. Rather than clarify any asserted violation of his rights traceable to the\n\nactions of a District agent or employee, plaintiff makes unfounded and unsupported accusations,\n\nsuch as his assertion that \u201cMetropolitan Police Officers were undercover . . . .\u201d Pl.\u2019s DC Opp\u2019n\n\nat 7. Although plaintiff attempts to pursue a claim under Monell v. New York City Department of\n\nSocial Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), alleging that the violations of his rights were caused by a\n\npolicy, practice, or custom of the District of Columbia, his conclusory allegations are insufficient\n\nto state a claim, since \u201ca plaintiff must identify a municipal policy, custom, or practice that\n\ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s alleged constitutional injury.\u201d DC\u2019s Mem. at 5 (citing Bd. of the County\n\nComm\u2019rs of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403 (1997), and Bush v. District of\n\nColumbia, 595 F.3d 384, 386 (D.C. Cir. 2010)). Indeed, it is only \u201cwhen execution of a\n\ngovernment\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is\n\nresponsible under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.\n\n       To pursue a Monell claim such as this, the plaintiff must allege an \u201caffirmative link\u201d\n\nestablishing that a municipal policy caused the constitutional violation, such as (1) \u201cthe explicit\n\nsetting of a policy by the government that violates the Constitution,\u201d (2) \u201c[t]he action of a policy\n\nmaker within the government,\u201d (3) \u201cthe adoption through a knowing failure to act by a policy\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fmaker of actions by his subordinates that are so consistent that they have become \u2018custom,\u2019\u201d or\n\n(4) \u201cthe failure of the government to respond to a need (for example, training of employees) in\n\nsuch a manner as to show deliberate indifference to the risk that not addressing the need will\n\nresult in constitutional violations.\u201d Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, plaintiff\u2019s allegations that he was\n\nsprayed by police and that he was led astray by Mayor Bowser\u2019s curfew alert do not come\n\nanywhere close to establishing the link required to survive a motion to dismiss his claim.\n\nPlaintiff asserts that he \u201cwas in compliance with the only orders provided by leaving two plus\n\nhours before curfew,\u201d seemingly implying that his rights have been violated because he was\n\nprosecuted for his conduct at the Capitol Building even though he complied with the curfew\n\norder. See Pl.\u2019s DC Sur-reply at 8. What plaintiff fails to acknowledge, however, is that he was\n\nprosecuted not for failure to comply with any order from the DC government, but for violating\n\nfederal laws in his criminal conduct at the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. These violations\n\nof federal law are wholly unrelated to any supposed compliance with Mayor Bowser\u2019s curfew\n\norder issued that day, and compliance with the curfew order does not immunize plaintiff from\n\nliability for his unrelated criminal acts committed that day. Plaintiff has thus failed to\n\ndemonstrate that his claims should not be dismissed for failure to plead allegations that would\n\nplausibly state a claim against the District.\n\n       Second, the District next argues that plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence, in violation of the\n\nFAAA, D.C. Code \u00a7 5-331.07(e)(1), fails because this statute only applies to District, not federal,\n\nproperty. DC\u2019s Mem. at 6\u20138. Section 5-331.07(e)(1) provides that upon determination that a\n\nFirst Amendment assembly should be dispersed, the MPD \u201cshall issue at least one clearly\n\naudible and understandable order to disperse using an amplification system or device,\u201d and that\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fMPD \u201cshall provide the participants a reasonable and adequate time to disperse and a clear and\n\nsafe route for dispersal.\u201d D.C. Code \u00a7 5-331.07(e)(1). This provision applies on the \u201cstreets,\n\nsidewalks, and other public ways, and in the parks of the District of Columbia.\u201d D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-\n\n331.03; 5-331.07. As the District points out, the events at issue in plaintiff\u2019s complaint happened\n\non the U.S. Capitol grounds, which is federal property secured by the USCP, see 40 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 5101-5102; D.C. Code \u00a7 10-503.19, and not on \u201cstreets, sidewalks, and other public ways,\n\nand in the parks of the District of Columbia,\u201d see D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-331.03; 5-331.07. 6\n\n        Lastly, the District argues that plaintiff has failed sufficiently to allege facts supporting\n\nany common law claims of \u201cmalice interference\u201d and slander. DC\u2019s Mem. at 8. Again,\n\nplaintiff\u2019s claims are conclusory and fail to satisfy the standards required to survive dismissal\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Plaintiff makes conclusory allegations of torts\n\npurportedly committed against him, such as that \u201c[t]he Mayor has not come forward clearing the\n\nnames, and stopping the prosecution of those who only trespassed,\u201d SAC at \u00b6 36, but fails to\n\nprovide \u201cfactual content to tie them to any District employees\u2019 actions for which the District\n\ncould be held liable,\u201d DC\u2019s Reply at 4, ECF No. 22. \u201cIndeed, there is no showing in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint that Christmann seeks relief for slander made by a District employee on\n\nJanuary 6, 2021 or any other identified date, nor any claims that a District employee raided his\n\nhouse in Brooklyn, NY on January 6, 2021 or any other date.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nPlaintiff does not allege with detail the acts taken by District that would constitute slander and\n\n\n\n\n6\n         Plaintiff argues that a statement purportedly made by Mayor Bowser during a congressional select\ncommittee hearing on January 12, 2022 that \u201cit became clear to me it was now our\u2014the [Capitol] building was our\nresponsibility\u201d subjects the District to liability under the FAAA for actions taken in the course of protecting the\nCapitol Building from the attack on January 6, 2021. See Pl.\u2019s DC Sur-reply at 2. Such a statement, describing the\nMayor\u2019s understanding of a crisis situation during a violent attack on federal government property, does not\noverwrite statutes that designate the Capitol Building as federal property.\n\n\n                                                        20\n\fsubject the municipality to tortious liability. Thus, his common law tort claims against defendant\n\nDC must also be dismissed. 7\n\nIV.      CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, taking the alleged facts in plaintiff\u2019s second amended\n\ncomplaint as true, plaintiff\u2019s claims must be dismissed, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\n         An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered contemporaneously.\n\n         Date: January 20, 2024\n\n\n                                                                __________________________\n                                                                BERYL A. HOWELL\n                                                                United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n7\n          The District correctly notes that plaintiff\u2019s claims of slander are barred by the one-year statute of\nlimitations, see DC\u2019s Mem. at 9, and that his claim for unliquidated damages fails because he did not satisfy the\nrequirements of D.C. Code \u00a7 12-309, which provides that \u201cwithin six months after the injury or damage was\nsustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney [must] give[] notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of\nColumbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury of damage.\u201d Although plaintiff\nattached to his opposition an acknowledgment letter noting that he notified the Office of Risk Management (\u201cOAR\u201d)\nof his claims against the District, that letter is dated August 25, 2022, and thus falls short of establishing that his\nreporting to the OAR was within the requisite six months of his purported injury, as required by statute. DC\u2019s Reply\nat 5. Plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 12-309 is further reason that his common law tort claims against the\nDistrict must be dismissed.\n\n                                                          21\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n DANIEL CHRISTMANN,\n\n                        Plaintiff,\n                                                           Civil Action No. 22-2189\n                        v.\n                                                           Judge Beryl A.

Plaintiff aims to hold the District liable for not setting an earlier time\n\nthan 6 PM in its curfew order, when an earlier time would supposedly have encouraged him to\n\nleave, rather than unlawfully enter, the Capitol Building. He also seeks to blame the USCP for\n\nnot physically preventing him from entering the Capitol Building, at a time when officers were\n\noverwhelmed by the thousands of rioters forcing entry into the building, and were focused on the\n\nsecurity of government officials and employees being evacuated as rioters made their way\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fthrough the building.

Notwithstanding\n\nthat pro se complaints, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\u201d are held to less stringent standards than\n\nthose applied to lawyer-drafted pleadings, Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94, plaintiff\u2019s complaint\n\ncontains allegations of liability on behalf of the defendants that are so unrealistic that they\n\ndeprive this Court of subject matter jurisdiction and thus may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1).\n\n       B.      USCP\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Must Be Granted\n\n       Set against the absurdity of plaintiff\u2019s claims, defendants also provide a number of\n\ntechnical reasons why each claim must be dismissed. First, plaintiff has failed to state a viable\n\nclaim entitling him to relief against the USCP. See generally SAC; see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6). A complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n\nface\u201d and to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it\n\nrests.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555\u201356.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d). Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s \u201conly factual allegations that name the\n\nCapitol Police are that Capitol Police officers watched him enter the Capitol Building and \u2018said\n\nnothing,\u2019\u201d and \u201cin many parts of the complaint, it is impossible to distinguish the allegations\n\nagainst District officials from the allegations against the Capitol Police.\u201d USCP\u2019s Mem. at 9.\n\nPlaintiff alleges that law enforcement did not issue dispersal orders, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201320, and that\n\npolice were \u201cspraying the stairs of those coming and going and not making any announcements,\u201d\n\nid. \u00b6 30; see also id. \u00b6 42. While these allegations could conceivably be against the USCP, as\n                                                  11\n\fone of the law enforcement agencies responding to the attack on the Capitol, plaintiff has failed\n\nto make clear in his complaint the direct tie between these allegations and the USCP. This\n\nfailure supports the granting of the USCP\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Harris v.\n\nHolder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2661976\"><a href=\"/opinion/2661976/harris-v-holder/\">885 F.

As noted by the USCP, plaintiff\n\ndoes not explain which factual allegations in his complaint support his various claims, and,\n\nalthough challenging his arrest for his conduct on January 6 as unconstitutional, \u201cdoes not plead\n\nfacts to demonstrate why the arrest was unconstitutional, or which of his constitutional rights the\n\narrest violated. . . .

Plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not provide the USCP with notice of the\n\nclaims asserted and the grounds on which they rest, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555\u201356, even\n\ntaking into account plaintiff\u2019s opposition, which fails to clarify any of his claims or make any\n\ncognizable legal defense to dismissal, see generally Pl.\u2019s USCP Opp\u2019n. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncomplaint must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim.\n\n         Even if the factual allegations were teased intelligibly together and broadly stretched to\n\nconstrue cognizable legal claims against the USCP that would not warrant dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) or under Rule 12(b)(1) as being fanciful or frivolous, those claims would still fail to\n\nestablish this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction as a legal matter.

Dismissal is thus warranted\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) for several additional reasons.\n\n       First, plaintiff\u2019s claims for monetary damages for alleged violations of his First and\n\nFourth Amendment rights are construed as constitutional tort claims against a federal agency\n\nand, as such, are barred by sovereign immunity.

Although plaintiff attempts to pursue a claim under Monell v.

Here, plaintiff\u2019s allegations that he was\n\nsprayed by police and that he was led astray by Mayor Bowser\u2019s curfew alert do not come\n\nanywhere close to establishing the link required to survive a motion to dismiss his claim.\n\nPlaintiff asserts that he \u201cwas in compliance with the only orders provided by leaving two plus\n\nhours before curfew,\u201d seemingly implying that his rights have been violated because he was\n\nprosecuted for his conduct at the Capitol Building even though he complied with the curfew\n\norder. See Pl.\u2019s DC Sur-reply at 8. What plaintiff fails to acknowledge, however, is that he was\n\nprosecuted not for failure to comply with any order from the DC government, but for violating\n\nfederal laws in his criminal conduct at the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. These violations\n\nof federal law are wholly unrelated to any supposed compliance with Mayor Bowser\u2019s curfew\n\norder issued that day, and compliance with the curfew order does not immunize plaintiff from\n\nliability for his unrelated criminal acts committed that day. Plaintiff has thus failed to\n\ndemonstrate that his claims should not be dismissed for failure to plead allegations that would\n\nplausibly state a claim against the District.\n\n       Second, the District next argues that plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence, in violation of the\n\nFAAA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">D.C. Code \u00a7 5-331.07</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e)(1), fails because this statute only applies to District, not federal,\n\nproperty. DC\u2019s Mem. at 6\u20138.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-331.03</span><pre class=\"inline\">; 5-331.07. 6\n\n        Lastly, the District argues that plaintiff has failed sufficiently to allege facts supporting\n\nany common law claims of \u201cmalice interference\u201d and slander. DC\u2019s Mem. at 8. Again,\n\nplaintiff\u2019s claims are conclusory and fail to satisfy the standards required to survive dismissal\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Plaintiff makes conclusory allegations of torts\n\npurportedly committed against him, such as that \u201c[t]he Mayor has not come forward clearing the\n\nnames, and stopping the prosecution of those who only trespassed,\u201d SAC at \u00b6 36, but fails to\n\nprovide \u201cfactual content to tie them to any District employees\u2019 actions for which the District\n\ncould be held liable,\u201d DC\u2019s Reply at 4, ECF No. 22. \u201cIndeed, there is no showing in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint that Christmann seeks relief for slander made by a District employee on\n\nJanuary 6, 2021 or any other identified date, nor any claims that a District employee raided his\n\nhouse in Brooklyn, NY on January 6, 2021 or any other date.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis in original).\n\nPlaintiff does not allege with detail the acts taken by District that would constitute slander and\n\n\n\n\n6\n         Plaintiff argues that a statement purportedly made by Mayor Bowser during a congressional select\ncommittee hearing on January 12, 2022 that \u201cit became clear to me it was now our\u2014the [Capitol] building was our\nresponsibility\u201d subjects the District to liability under the FAAA for actions taken in the course of protecting the\nCapitol Building from the attack on January 6, 2021. See Pl.\u2019s DC Sur-reply at 2. Such a statement, describing the\nMayor\u2019s understanding of a crisis situation during a violent attack on federal government property, does not\noverwrite statutes that designate the Capitol Building as federal property.\n\n\n                                                        20\n\fsubject the municipality to tortious liability. Thus, his common law tort claims against defendant\n\nDC must also be dismissed. 7\n\nIV.      CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, taking the alleged facts in plaintiff\u2019s second amended\n\ncomplaint as true, plaintiff\u2019s claims must be dismissed, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n\n         An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered contemporaneously.\n\n         Date: January 20, 2024\n\n\n                                                                __________________________\n                                                                BERYL A.

Code \u00a7 12-309</span><pre class=\"inline\">, which provides that \u201cwithin six months after the injury or damage was\nsustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney [must] give[] notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of\nColumbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury of damage.\u201d Although plaintiff\nattached to his opposition an acknowledgment letter noting that he notified the Office of Risk Management (\u201cOAR\u201d)\nof his claims against the District, that letter is dated August 25, 2022, and thus falls short of establishing that his\nreporting to the OAR was within the requisite six months of his purported injury, as required by statute. DC\u2019s Reply\nat 5. Plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 12-309 is further reason that his common law tort claims against the\nDistrict must be dismissed.\n\n                                                          21\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/103492/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/106345/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107933/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112858/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112931/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/117845/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/131156/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145677/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/185950/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186549/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/187141/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/187408/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/204553/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/623139/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/681587/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/712061/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/820904/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/856345/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1462298/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2349166/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2528812/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2661976/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2662887/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2807857/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2816588/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2827981/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4116445/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4409831/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8444074/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/8753931/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/9925505/", "id": 9925505, "absolute_url": "/opinion/9467667/in-re-steve-gerdes-v-the-state-of-texas/", "cluster_id": 9467667, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/9467667/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2024-01-19T23:11:11.318799-08:00", "date_modified": "2024-01-19T23:11:23.206981-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "df946245f23d9f76c6eb23cecae3c1392de43a6f", "page_count": 1, "download_url": "https://search.txcourts.gov/RetrieveDocument.aspx?DocId=13922&Index=%5c%5c10%2e20%2e4%2e7%5cTamesIndexes%5ccoa11%5cOpinion", "local_path": "pdf/2024/01/18/in_re_steve_gerdes_v._the_state_of_texas_1.pdf", "plain_text": "                             11TH COURT OF APPEALS\n                                EASTLAND, TEXAS\n                                    JUDGMENT\n\nIn re Steve Gerdes,                          * Original Mandamus Proceeding\n\nNo. 11-23-00283-CV                           * January 18, 2024\n\n                                             * Memorandum Opinion by Bailey, C.J.\n                                               (Panel consists of: Bailey, C.J.,\n                                               Trotter, J., and Williams, J.)\n\n     This court has inspected the record in this cause and concludes that Relator\u2019s\npetition for writ of mandamus should be granted in part.

However, by determining that Moize and\nMcGinnis are not and (by implication) cannot be subject to recall, the commissioners\nhave misconstrued their role and responsibilities in the process.\n       Our sister courts of appeals have consistently held that, absent charter\nprovisions that expressly state otherwise, city commissioners and other city officials\nhave no right or authority to refuse a recall petition based on their own findings that\nthe petition is defective.

II, \u00a7 24 (emphasis added). It does\nnot vest in the commissioners the duty, right, or authority to conduct a review of the\npetition to determine whether it is sufficient to satisfy the terms of the charter. Id.\n      Like our sister courts, we are reluctant to imply any degree of discretion on\nthe part of the commissioners under the terms of the charter. Otherwise, the fox\nguards the henhouse. As the Dallas Court of Appeals observed in Howard:\n      [T]o imply authority on the part of the council to make the ultimate\n      determination of sufficiency of the petition would commit the decision\n      to a body that could not be considered impartial. Every recall petition\n                                           4\n\f        affects at least one of the council members directly, and\n        contemporaneous petitions with respect to other members might well\n        affect a majority, or, indeed, all members of the council. In that\n        situation, each member of the council would be called on to vote on the\n        sufficiency of petitions calling for recall of other members.\n589 S.W.2d at 752.\n        The commissioners argue that they are merely engaged in the act of counting\ncertifications in the petitions, an act that does not involve the use of \u201cunauthorized\ndiscretion.\u201d However, in this instance, neither Moize nor McGinnis were elected to\nthe seats that they currently hold, and it is therefore impossible for the petitions to\ncontain the certifications described in the charter. 3                            Implied within the\ncommissioners\u2019 decision to \u201ccount\u201d certifications is a much more central (and\ncritical) determination: that, by virtue of occupying seats to which they were never\nelected, Moize and McGinnis are effectively immune to recall under the terms of the\ncharter. In reaching this conclusion, the commissioners are not merely \u201ccounting,\u201d\nthey also engaged in an act of construction. 4 We have examined the recall provisions\nin the charter and conclude that the commissioners are given no discretion to\nconstrue or interpret the charter prior to ordering the recall.\n\n\n\n        3\n          The petitions each contained a column in which a signatory could certify that they voted for either\nMoize or McGinnis, respectively, in the last election. Of the ninety-two people who signed the petition to\nrecall Moize, only one appears to have certified that they voted for Moize in the last regular election.\nAnother seven attempts at certification appear to be crossed out, although it is not clear when and why those\ncertifications were removed. Of the ninety-one people who signed the petition to recall McGinnis, eight\nappear to have certified that they voted for her in the last general election, although several attempts at\ncertification are again crossed out.\n\n        4\n          Although it is not necessary for us to reach the issue, we find the commissioners\u2019 self-serving\nconstruction of the charter to be questionable. The charter provides that any \u201celective officer\u201d (defined as\nincluding the mayor and commissioners) \u201cshall be subject to recall.\u201d RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II,\n\u00a7 24, art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5. Like all other recall provisions, this clause \u201cshould be liberally construed in favor of\nthe power reserved.\u201d In re Woodfill, 470 S.W.3d 473, 480 (Tex. 2015) (quoting Taxpayers\u2019 Ass\u2019n of Harris\nCnty. v. City of Houston, 105 S.W.2d 655, 657 (1937)). As such, it is likely that the one-fifth certification\nrequirement is inapplicable when, as here, commissioners occupy seats to which they were not elected.\n                                                       5\n\f      If the commissioners were concerned that the petitions were defective under\nthe terms of the charter, they could have scheduled the recall election within the\ntimeframe required by the charter while simultaneously seeking declaratory relief in\nthe district court. See Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 622 (\u201cIn the absence of any such\ncharter provision giving the discretionary right to determine the sufficiency of the\npetitions, we believe due process gives the respondents the right to file a suit in the\nDistrict Court naming and citing interested parties and thereby obtaining a judicial\ndetermination of sufficiency of the petitions in an adversary proceeding after proper\nnotice of hearing.\u201d); see also Duffy, 828 S.W.2d at 214. However, they cannot\nchoose to do nothing based on their own unilateral construction of the charter.\n                                  The Election Code\n      As a second justification for failing to act on the petitions, the commissioners\nassert that they are unable to schedule a recall election as a result of restrictions that\nare imposed on them by state law.\n      In support of this justification, the commissioners assert that the charter\u2019s\nprovisions regarding the timing of the election are preempted by the Texas Election\nCode, which requires all general and special elections to take place on one of two\nannual uniform election dates. See ELEC. \u00a7 41.001(a). \u201cGeneral elections\u201d are\nelections, other than primary elections, that occur on fixed dates. ELEC. \u00a7 1.005(6).\n\u201cSpecial elections\u201d are any elections that are not general or primary elections. Id.\n\u00a7 1.005(18). Recall elections qualify as special elections and are therefore subject\nto the uniform election date requirements. Burns, 658 S.W.2d at 734.\n      The commissioners argue that the seats that are occupied by Moize and\nMcGinnis are already up for reelection at the time of the next general election, which\nwill take place in May 2024. As such, they reason, there would be no point in\nholding a recall election at that time.\n\n                                            6\n\f        The commissioners acknowledge that the uniform election requirements in\nsection 41.001(a) do not apply to court-ordered elections, and that we therefore have\nthe authority to order a recall election outside of a uniform date.                                   ELEC.\n\u00a7 41.001(b)(3). However, they argue that Gerdes must still present a compelling\ncase for the court to ignore the requirements of the Election Code, and that he has\nfailed to do so. We disagree.\n        The next general election date following the submission of the petitions was\nNovember 7, 2023. See ELEC. \u00a7 41.001(a)(3) (establishing a uniform election date\non \u201cthe first Tuesday after the first Monday in November\u201d).                              In that regard,\nthe commissioners could have ordered a November 7 recall election as late as\nAugust 21, 2023. See ELEC. \u00a7 3.005(c) (elections should be ordered not later than\nthe seventy-eighth day before election day). Had the commissioners promptly acted\non the petitions that were submitted by Gerdes, the recall election could have been\nheld on November 7, 2023, if not sooner.5                        As such, we conclude that the\ncommissioners have unnecessarily delayed the election, and that Gerdes has laid out\na clear and compelling argument for the court to order a recall election prior to the\nnext uniform election date.               See In re Johnson, No. 10-14-00341-CV, 2015\nWL 505220, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco Feb. 2, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.) (orig.\nproceeding) (because election not scheduled on uniform election date as a result of\ndelay by city council, \u201cthe recall election should not be further delayed\u201d by holding\nit on the next uniform election date); Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 625 (following delay\nby city council based on alleged insufficiency of recall petition, election ordered to\ntake place \u201cnot less than twenty-five days nor more than thirty-five days from the\n\n        5\n         We do not pass on the question of whether the election date should have been determined by the\nterms of the charter or the terms of the Election Code. Likewise, although we believe there is a compelling\nreason for us to act in this instance, we do not comment on the commissioners\u2019 assertion that Gerdes is\nrequired to offer an \u201canalysis or rationale for ignoring [the] mandatory sections of the Election Code\u201d before\nwe can order an election outside of a uniform date.\n                                                        7\n\fdate the judgment of this court became final,\u201d consistent with requirements in city\ncharter).\n            Eastland County Judge David Hullum is Not a Necessary Party\n      The charter provides that, where the city fails to receive the recall petition,\norder the election, or discharge other related duties, \u201cthe County Judge of Eastland\nCounty, Texas, shall discharge any such duties.\u201d RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II,\n\u00a7 24. As a result of this provision, Gerdes has named Eastland County Judge\nDavid Hullum as a respondent.\n      Provisions such as this, which require a county judge to compel a recall\nelection in the event the city government fails to act, appear in several charters\nthroughout the state. See Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 624 (Angleton charter requiring\ncounty judge to compel recall election if city government fails or refuses to act);\nDuffy, 828 S.W.2d at 213 (Addision charter required county judge to order a recall\nelection); Burns, 658 S.W.2d at 733 (county judge asked to call a recall election \u201cin\ncompliance with\u201d the Colleyville charter). And like the courts in Blanchard and\nDuffy, we question whether there is any constitutional or statutory authority that\npermits the City of Ranger to impose a duty on the Eastland County Judge to order\nan election. Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 624; Duffy, 828 S.W.2d at 213; see also\nTex. Att\u2019y Gen. Op. No. GA-0870 (2011) (\u201cTexas law does not authorize a county\njudge to order a special municipal recall election.\u201d). Nevertheless, because we can\nafford full relief to Gerdes by ordering the commissioners to proceed with the recall\nelection, we find it unnecessary to reach the question of whether Judge Hullum is\ncompelled to act in this situation.\n                                 This Court\u2019s Ruling\n      We grant the petition for writ of mandamus as to the Ranger city\ncommissioners and deny the petition with respect to Judge Hullum.

II, \u00a7 24 (emphasis added). It does\nnot vest in the commissioners the duty, right, or authority to conduct a review of the\npetition to determine whether it is sufficient to satisfy the terms of the charter. Id.\n      Like our sister courts, we are reluctant to imply any degree of discretion on\nthe part of the commissioners under the terms of the charter. Otherwise, the fox\nguards the henhouse. As the Dallas Court of Appeals observed in Howard:\n      [T]o imply authority on the part of the council to make the ultimate\n      determination of sufficiency of the petition would commit the decision\n      to a body that could not be considered impartial. Every recall petition\n                                           4\n\f        affects at least one of the council members directly, and\n        contemporaneous petitions with respect to other members might well\n        affect a majority, or, indeed, all members of the council. In that\n        situation, each member of the council would be called on to vote on the\n        sufficiency of petitions calling for recall of other members.\n589 S.W.2d at 752.\n        The commissioners argue that they are merely engaged in the act of counting\ncertifications in the petitions, an act that does not involve the use of \u201cunauthorized\ndiscretion.\u201d However, in this instance, neither Moize nor McGinnis were elected to\nthe seats that they currently hold, and it is therefore impossible for the petitions to\ncontain the certifications described in the charter. 3                            Implied within the\ncommissioners\u2019 decision to \u201ccount\u201d certifications is a much more central (and\ncritical) determination: that, by virtue of occupying seats to which they were never\nelected, Moize and McGinnis are effectively immune to recall under the terms of the\ncharter. In reaching this conclusion, the commissioners are not merely \u201ccounting,\u201d\nthey also engaged in an act of construction. 4 We have examined the recall provisions\nin the charter and conclude that the commissioners are given no discretion to\nconstrue or interpret the charter prior to ordering the recall.\n\n\n\n        3\n          The petitions each contained a column in which a signatory could certify that they voted for either\nMoize or McGinnis, respectively, in the last election. Of the ninety-two people who signed the petition to\nrecall Moize, only one appears to have certified that they voted for Moize in the last regular election.\nAnother seven attempts at certification appear to be crossed out, although it is not clear when and why those\ncertifications were removed. Of the ninety-one people who signed the petition to recall McGinnis, eight\nappear to have certified that they voted for her in the last general election, although several attempts at\ncertification are again crossed out.\n\n        4\n          Although it is not necessary for us to reach the issue, we find the commissioners\u2019 self-serving\nconstruction of the charter to be questionable. The charter provides that any \u201celective officer\u201d (defined as\nincluding the mayor and commissioners) \u201cshall be subject to recall.\u201d RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II,\n\u00a7 24, art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5. Like all other recall provisions, this clause \u201cshould be liberally construed in favor of\nthe power reserved.\u201d In re Woodfill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">470 S.W.3d 473</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (Tex. 2015) (quoting Taxpayers\u2019 Ass\u2019n of Harris\nCnty. v.

As such, it is likely that the one-fifth certification\nrequirement is inapplicable when, as here, commissioners occupy seats to which they were not elected.\n                                                       5\n\f      If the commissioners were concerned that the petitions were defective under\nthe terms of the charter, they could have scheduled the recall election within the\ntimeframe required by the charter while simultaneously seeking declaratory relief in\nthe district court. See Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 622 (\u201cIn the absence of any such\ncharter provision giving the discretionary right to determine the sufficiency of the\npetitions, we believe due process gives the respondents the right to file a suit in the\nDistrict Court naming and citing interested parties and thereby obtaining a judicial\ndetermination of sufficiency of the petitions in an adversary proceeding after proper\nnotice of hearing.\u201d); see also Duffy, 828 S.W.2d at 214. However, they cannot\nchoose to do nothing based on their own unilateral construction of the charter.\n                                  The Election Code\n      As a second justification for failing to act on the petitions, the commissioners\nassert that they are unable to schedule a recall election as a result of restrictions that\nare imposed on them by state law.\n      In support of this justification, the commissioners assert that the charter\u2019s\nprovisions regarding the timing of the election are preempted by the Texas Election\nCode, which requires all general and special elections to take place on one of two\nannual uniform election dates. See ELEC. \u00a7 41.001(a). \u201cGeneral elections\u201d are\nelections, other than primary elections, that occur on fixed dates. ELEC. \u00a7 1.005(6).\n\u201cSpecial elections\u201d are any elections that are not general or primary elections. Id.\n\u00a7 1.005(18). Recall elections qualify as special elections and are therefore subject\nto the uniform election date requirements. Burns, 658 S.W.2d at 734.\n      The commissioners argue that the seats that are occupied by Moize and\nMcGinnis are already up for reelection at the time of the next general election, which\nwill take place in May 2024. As such, they reason, there would be no point in\nholding a recall election at that time.\n\n                                            6\n\f        The commissioners acknowledge that the uniform election requirements in\nsection 41.001(a) do not apply to court-ordered elections, and that we therefore have\nthe authority to order a recall election outside of a uniform date.                                   ELEC.\n\u00a7 41.001(b)(3). However, they argue that Gerdes must still present a compelling\ncase for the court to ignore the requirements of the Election Code, and that he has\nfailed to do so. We disagree.\n        The next general election date following the submission of the petitions was\nNovember 7, 2023. See ELEC. \u00a7 41.001(a)(3) (establishing a uniform election date\non \u201cthe first Tuesday after the first Monday in November\u201d).                              In that regard,\nthe commissioners could have ordered a November 7 recall election as late as\nAugust 21, 2023. See ELEC. \u00a7 3.005(c) (elections should be ordered not later than\nthe seventy-eighth day before election day). Had the commissioners promptly acted\non the petitions that were submitted by Gerdes, the recall election could have been\nheld on November 7, 2023, if not sooner.5                        As such, we conclude that the\ncommissioners have unnecessarily delayed the election, and that Gerdes has laid out\na clear and compelling argument for the court to order a recall election prior to the\nnext uniform election date.               See In re Johnson, No. 10-14-00341-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2015\nWL 505220</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco Feb. 2, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.)

Likewise, although we believe there is a compelling\nreason for us to act in this instance, we do not comment on the commissioners\u2019 assertion that Gerdes is\nrequired to offer an \u201canalysis or rationale for ignoring [the] mandatory sections of the Election Code\u201d before\nwe can order an election outside of a uniform date.\n                                                        7\n\fdate the judgment of this court became final,\u201d consistent with requirements in city\ncharter).\n            Eastland County Judge David Hullum is Not a Necessary Party\n      The charter provides that, where the city fails to receive the recall petition,\norder the election, or discharge other related duties, \u201cthe County Judge of Eastland\nCounty, Texas, shall discharge any such duties.\u201d RANGER, TEX., CHARTER, art. II,\n\u00a7 24. As a result of this provision, Gerdes has named Eastland County Judge\nDavid Hullum as a respondent.\n      Provisions such as this, which require a county judge to compel a recall\nelection in the event the city government fails to act, appear in several charters\nthroughout the state. See Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 624 (Angleton charter requiring\ncounty judge to compel recall election if city government fails or refuses to act);\nDuffy, 828 S.W.2d at 213 (Addision charter required county judge to order a recall\nelection); Burns, 658 S.W.2d at 733 (county judge asked to call a recall election \u201cin\ncompliance with\u201d the Colleyville charter). And like the courts in Blanchard and\nDuffy, we question whether there is any constitutional or statutory authority that\npermits the City of Ranger to impose a duty on the Eastland County Judge to order\nan election. Blanchard, 633 S.W.2d at 624; Duffy, 828 S.W.2d at 213; see also\nTex. Att\u2019y Gen. Op. No. GA-0870 (2011) (\u201cTexas law does not authorize a county\njudge to order a special municipal recall election.\u201d). Nevertheless, because we can\nafford full relief to Gerdes by ordering the commissioners to proceed with the recall\nelection, we find it unnecessary to reach the question of whether Judge Hullum is\ncompelled to act in this situation.\n                                 This Court\u2019s Ruling\n      We grant the petition for writ of mandamus as to the Ranger city\ncommissioners and deny the petition with respect to Judge Hullum.
