Department of Agriculture, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Docket Number DC-0752-18-0143-I-1 (February 1, 2024).\\n\\nThe narrow scope of the review process for an initial decision\\u2019s dismissal was highlighted in the case of Francesca Perla Yabraian against the Department of Agriculture. The appellant filed a petition against the initial decision, arguing that her file for appeal was not late. The board would only consider accepting such petitions if they met specific criteria as outlined in 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115. These criteria included erroneous findings of material fact, erroneous interpretation or application of statutes or regulation, inconsistencies in the administrative judge\\u2019s rulings that were not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, resulting in an error that affected the case outcome, and new material evidence or legal argument that was not available when the record closed despite the petitioner\\u2019s due diligence.\\n\\nHowever, after careful examination of the appeal, the board found that the petitioner did not provide any basis within these criteria, leading to the dismissal of their petition for review. Their initial decision has since been made final by the board in accordance with 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.113(b).\\n\\nIn her review petition, Yabraian argued that she possesses additional evidence proving that her appeal was submitted on time. She also claimed that she attempted to file this evidence before the record was closed but was unable to do so because of a 'technological error.' Yet, according to 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115, the board generally does not consider evidence submitted for the first time along with the petition for review unless it can be proven that the evidence was not available before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. Yabraian's additional evidence was available to her before the closure of the record, and she did not sufficiently explain the supposed \\\"technical error\\\" that prevented her from filing the evidence before the closure. Neither did she show any attempts to bring this mistake to the attention of the administrative judge before the record was closed. The board, therefore, found no grounds to consider the evidence. \\n\\nFollowing the final decision, Yabraian has the right to seek a review as per 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(a)(1). The nature of her claims will determine the time limit for seeking such a review and the ideal forum to file it according to 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(b). She is advised to immediately review the law applicable to her claims and follow all filing time limits and requirements to avoid her case's dismissal by her chosen forum. It\\u2019s crucial to note that the MSPB doesn't provide legal advice on which option is the most appropriate for individual situations. Consequently, Yabraian should carefully evaluate each of the three primary choices for review that apply to her particular case.\",\n          \"The case was heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on 2nd February 2024. The case, no. 23-1327 (D.C. No 1:23-CV-00944-LTB), was reviewed by Judges Matheson, Briscoe, and Eid. The case bears reference to (D.C. districts in Colorado).\\n\\nThe plaintiff in the case was Jeremiah Casper, who filed a pro se case from his state prison in Colorado. Casper, in his capacity as a state prisoner, lodged a civil rights complaint against several people associated with the Garfield County Jail, located in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.\\n\\nCasper outlined about 26 separate claims against the defendants, which included Lou Vallaria, Jim Meyer, James Brassfield, James Roe, Nick Nelson, Deputies Hammond, Casselman, Blackwell, and Mayor Jonathon Godes. The mentioned defendants were all either employees or related parties to the Garfield County Jail. The charges filed by Casper detail alleged civil rights violations that occurred at the prison.\\n\\nDespite the specific instructions on the court-approved complaint form, Casper did not fill out much of the document. Instead, he included many pieces of loose-leaf paper that underpinned his claims. He also attached various exhibits in support of his claims.\\n\\nThe Magistrate Judge and the District Court both directed Casper to refile his suit on a proper prisoner complaint form, and complete all sections accordingly, making additional attachments only when necessary. Casper rejected these instructions and claimed that his choice of the original format was strategic.\\n\\nAccording to Casper, the original lawsuit's format was best suited to his strategy. Consequently, he requested that the District court allow the case to proceed with the complaint served on the defending parties. The District Court, however, denied his request on the grounds that it was improperly formatted. Instead, the District Court ruled in favor of dismissing the case without prejudice due to Casper's failure to comply with the court's request to refile on a court-approved prisoner complaint form.\\n\\nCasper took his claims to this Appeals Court under the purview of the U.S. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1291 statutory law. After considering the circumstances, the court decided to affirm the ruling of the District Court, denying Casper's insistence on proceeding in forma pauperis on the appeal. \\n\\nBack on 14th April 2023, Casper launched the suit, filing a pro se prisoner complaint setting forth claims as per the 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 rule of the United States Code. His complaint revealed that he was a convicted and sentenced state prisoner staying in a correctional facility based in Sterling, Colorado. \\n\\nCasper's initial complaint was mostly incomplete despite being issued by the court. He failed to properly fill out the sections, explicitly referring the court to the attached 'Claims Suffered' 1-26 in his 'STATEMENT OF CLAIM(S)' section. Several handwritten pages and supportive documents made up the remaining content of the 149-page complaint. The added documents claimed that all actions he was disputing took place within the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, between August 2020 and June 2021.\",\n          \"conditions are present.\\u201d The policy also instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. The policy does not specify how often employees should check for water accumulation, but it does state that \\u201cevery associate is responsible for customer safety.\\u201d\\n\\nDeakins filed a negligence lawsuit against Walmart in state court, alleging that Walmart breached its duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition by failing to keep the floor dry. He stated that Walmart knew or should have known that the floor was wet and posed a danger. Walmart removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.\\n\\nAfter discovery, Walmart filed a motion for summary judgment. It argued that Deakins could not establish that Walmart had actual or constructive knowledge of the water on the floor before Deakins slipped. In response, Deakins argued that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy created a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water.\\n\\nThe district court granted Walmart\\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that the surveillance video did not show that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have constructive knowledge of it. The court also found that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy was not evidence of negligence because the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining.\\n\\nThis appeal followed.\\n\\nII. Standard of Review\\n\\nWe review a district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards that bound the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate when \\u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d A dispute about a material fact is \\u201cgenuine\\u201d only if \\u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\\u201d We view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\\n\\nIII. Discussion\\n\\nUnder Florida law, to succeed on a negligence claim based on a slip and fall on a transitory foreign substance in a business establishment, a plaintiff must prove that the business had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and should have taken action to remedy it. Actual knowledge requires proof that the business was aware of the dangerous condition at the time of the slip and fall. Constructive knowledge can be proven by circumstantial evidence showing that (1) the dangerous condition existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of ordinary care, the business establishment should have known of the condition, or (2) the condition occurred with regularity and was therefore foreseeable.\\n\\nDeakins argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Walmart because a reasonable jury could find that Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. He contends that the surveillance video shows that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it and that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence.\\n\\nWe agree with Deakins that the surveillance video creates a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water. The video shows wet spots on the floor of the vestibule as shoppers enter the store, even before Deakins arrives. It also shows Deakins slipping on water that is not visible in the seconds before the slip, but is clearly visible afterward. While it is not completely clear from the video whether Deakins himself tracked the water in from outside the store or whether it was already present, a reasonable jury could infer from the video that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it.\\n\\nWe also agree with Deakins that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence. Although the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining, the policy instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. This implies that Walmart recognizes the risk of water accumulation in its stores, even when it is not raining. A reasonable jury could infer from Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own policy that it was negligent.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we find that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy create a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Walmart and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nIV. Conclusion\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nSO ORDERED.\\n\\nPER CURIAM:\\n\\nLAGOA, BRASHER, and ED CARNES, Circuit Judges, concur.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 400,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Department of Agriculture, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Docket Number DC-0752-18-0143-I-1 (February 1, 2024).\\n\\nThe narrow scope of the review process for an initial decision\\u2019s dismissal was highlighted in the case of Francesca Perla Yabraian against the Department of Agriculture. The appellant filed a petition against the initial decision, arguing that her file for appeal was not late. The board would only consider accepting such petitions if they met specific criteria as outlined in 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115. These criteria included erroneous findings of material fact, erroneous interpretation or application of statutes or regulation, inconsistencies in the administrative judge\\u2019s rulings that were not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, resulting in an error that affected the case outcome, and new material evidence or legal argument that was not available when the record closed despite the petitioner\\u2019s due diligence.\\n\\nHowever, after careful examination of the appeal, the board found that the petitioner did not provide any basis within these criteria, leading to the dismissal of their petition for review. Their initial decision has since been made final by the board in accordance with 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.113(b).\\n\\nIn her review petition, Yabraian argued that she possesses additional evidence proving that her appeal was submitted on time. She also claimed that she attempted to file this evidence before the record was closed but was unable to do so because of a 'technological error.' Yet, according to 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115, the board generally does not consider evidence submitted for the first time along with the petition for review unless it can be proven that the evidence was not available before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. Yabraian's additional evidence was available to her before the closure of the record, and she did not sufficiently explain the supposed \\\"technical error\\\" that prevented her from filing the evidence before the closure. Neither did she show any attempts to bring this mistake to the attention of the administrative judge before the record was closed. The board, therefore, found no grounds to consider the evidence. \\n\\nFollowing the final decision, Yabraian has the right to seek a review as per 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(a)(1). The nature of her claims will determine the time limit for seeking such a review and the ideal forum to file it according to 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(b). She is advised to immediately review the law applicable to her claims and follow all filing time limits and requirements to avoid her case's dismissal by her chosen forum. It\\u2019s crucial to note that the MSPB doesn't provide legal advice on which option is the most appropriate for individual situations. Consequently, Yabraian should carefully evaluate each of the three primary choices for review that apply to her particular case.\",\n          \"The case was heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on 2nd February 2024. The case, no. 23-1327 (D.C. No 1:23-CV-00944-LTB), was reviewed by Judges Matheson, Briscoe, and Eid. The case bears reference to (D.C. districts in Colorado).\\n\\nThe plaintiff in the case was Jeremiah Casper, who filed a pro se case from his state prison in Colorado. Casper, in his capacity as a state prisoner, lodged a civil rights complaint against several people associated with the Garfield County Jail, located in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.\\n\\nCasper outlined about 26 separate claims against the defendants, which included Lou Vallaria, Jim Meyer, James Brassfield, James Roe, Nick Nelson, Deputies Hammond, Casselman, Blackwell, and Mayor Jonathon Godes. The mentioned defendants were all either employees or related parties to the Garfield County Jail. The charges filed by Casper detail alleged civil rights violations that occurred at the prison.\\n\\nDespite the specific instructions on the court-approved complaint form, Casper did not fill out much of the document. Instead, he included many pieces of loose-leaf paper that underpinned his claims. He also attached various exhibits in support of his claims.\\n\\nThe Magistrate Judge and the District Court both directed Casper to refile his suit on a proper prisoner complaint form, and complete all sections accordingly, making additional attachments only when necessary. Casper rejected these instructions and claimed that his choice of the original format was strategic.\\n\\nAccording to Casper, the original lawsuit's format was best suited to his strategy. Consequently, he requested that the District court allow the case to proceed with the complaint served on the defending parties. The District Court, however, denied his request on the grounds that it was improperly formatted. Instead, the District Court ruled in favor of dismissing the case without prejudice due to Casper's failure to comply with the court's request to refile on a court-approved prisoner complaint form.\\n\\nCasper took his claims to this Appeals Court under the purview of the U.S. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1291 statutory law. After considering the circumstances, the court decided to affirm the ruling of the District Court, denying Casper's insistence on proceeding in forma pauperis on the appeal. \\n\\nBack on 14th April 2023, Casper launched the suit, filing a pro se prisoner complaint setting forth claims as per the 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 rule of the United States Code. His complaint revealed that he was a convicted and sentenced state prisoner staying in a correctional facility based in Sterling, Colorado. \\n\\nCasper's initial complaint was mostly incomplete despite being issued by the court. He failed to properly fill out the sections, explicitly referring the court to the attached 'Claims Suffered' 1-26 in his 'STATEMENT OF CLAIM(S)' section. Several handwritten pages and supportive documents made up the remaining content of the 149-page complaint. The added documents claimed that all actions he was disputing took place within the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, between August 2020 and June 2021.\",\n          \"conditions are present.\\u201d The policy also instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. The policy does not specify how often employees should check for water accumulation, but it does state that \\u201cevery associate is responsible for customer safety.\\u201d\\n\\nDeakins filed a negligence lawsuit against Walmart in state court, alleging that Walmart breached its duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition by failing to keep the floor dry. He stated that Walmart knew or should have known that the floor was wet and posed a danger. Walmart removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.\\n\\nAfter discovery, Walmart filed a motion for summary judgment. It argued that Deakins could not establish that Walmart had actual or constructive knowledge of the water on the floor before Deakins slipped. In response, Deakins argued that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy created a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water.\\n\\nThe district court granted Walmart\\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that the surveillance video did not show that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have constructive knowledge of it. The court also found that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy was not evidence of negligence because the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining.\\n\\nThis appeal followed.\\n\\nII. Standard of Review\\n\\nWe review a district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards that bound the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate when \\u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d A dispute about a material fact is \\u201cgenuine\\u201d only if \\u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\\u201d We view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\\n\\nIII. Discussion\\n\\nUnder Florida law, to succeed on a negligence claim based on a slip and fall on a transitory foreign substance in a business establishment, a plaintiff must prove that the business had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and should have taken action to remedy it. Actual knowledge requires proof that the business was aware of the dangerous condition at the time of the slip and fall. Constructive knowledge can be proven by circumstantial evidence showing that (1) the dangerous condition existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of ordinary care, the business establishment should have known of the condition, or (2) the condition occurred with regularity and was therefore foreseeable.\\n\\nDeakins argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Walmart because a reasonable jury could find that Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. He contends that the surveillance video shows that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it and that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence.\\n\\nWe agree with Deakins that the surveillance video creates a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water. The video shows wet spots on the floor of the vestibule as shoppers enter the store, even before Deakins arrives. It also shows Deakins slipping on water that is not visible in the seconds before the slip, but is clearly visible afterward. While it is not completely clear from the video whether Deakins himself tracked the water in from outside the store or whether it was already present, a reasonable jury could infer from the video that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it.\\n\\nWe also agree with Deakins that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence. Although the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining, the policy instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. This implies that Walmart recognizes the risk of water accumulation in its stores, even when it is not raining. A reasonable jury could infer from Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own policy that it was negligent.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we find that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy create a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Walmart and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nIV. Conclusion\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nSO ORDERED.\\n\\nPER CURIAM:\\n\\nLAGOA, BRASHER, and ED CARNES, Circuit Judges, concur.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 400,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Department of Agriculture, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Docket Number DC-0752-18-0143-I-1 (February 1, 2024).\\n\\nThe narrow scope of the review process for an initial decision\\u2019s dismissal was highlighted in the case of Francesca Perla Yabraian against the Department of Agriculture. The appellant filed a petition against the initial decision, arguing that her file for appeal was not late. The board would only consider accepting such petitions if they met specific criteria as outlined in 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115. These criteria included erroneous findings of material fact, erroneous interpretation or application of statutes or regulation, inconsistencies in the administrative judge\\u2019s rulings that were not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, resulting in an error that affected the case outcome, and new material evidence or legal argument that was not available when the record closed despite the petitioner\\u2019s due diligence.\\n\\nHowever, after careful examination of the appeal, the board found that the petitioner did not provide any basis within these criteria, leading to the dismissal of their petition for review. Their initial decision has since been made final by the board in accordance with 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.113(b).\\n\\nIn her review petition, Yabraian argued that she possesses additional evidence proving that her appeal was submitted on time. She also claimed that she attempted to file this evidence before the record was closed but was unable to do so because of a 'technological error.' Yet, according to 5 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1201.115, the board generally does not consider evidence submitted for the first time along with the petition for review unless it can be proven that the evidence was not available before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. Yabraian's additional evidence was available to her before the closure of the record, and she did not sufficiently explain the supposed \\\"technical error\\\" that prevented her from filing the evidence before the closure. Neither did she show any attempts to bring this mistake to the attention of the administrative judge before the record was closed. The board, therefore, found no grounds to consider the evidence. \\n\\nFollowing the final decision, Yabraian has the right to seek a review as per 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(a)(1). The nature of her claims will determine the time limit for seeking such a review and the ideal forum to file it according to 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 7703(b). She is advised to immediately review the law applicable to her claims and follow all filing time limits and requirements to avoid her case's dismissal by her chosen forum. It\\u2019s crucial to note that the MSPB doesn't provide legal advice on which option is the most appropriate for individual situations. Consequently, Yabraian should carefully evaluate each of the three primary choices for review that apply to her particular case.\",\n          \"The case was heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on 2nd February 2024. The case, no. 23-1327 (D.C. No 1:23-CV-00944-LTB), was reviewed by Judges Matheson, Briscoe, and Eid. The case bears reference to (D.C. districts in Colorado).\\n\\nThe plaintiff in the case was Jeremiah Casper, who filed a pro se case from his state prison in Colorado. Casper, in his capacity as a state prisoner, lodged a civil rights complaint against several people associated with the Garfield County Jail, located in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.\\n\\nCasper outlined about 26 separate claims against the defendants, which included Lou Vallaria, Jim Meyer, James Brassfield, James Roe, Nick Nelson, Deputies Hammond, Casselman, Blackwell, and Mayor Jonathon Godes. The mentioned defendants were all either employees or related parties to the Garfield County Jail. The charges filed by Casper detail alleged civil rights violations that occurred at the prison.\\n\\nDespite the specific instructions on the court-approved complaint form, Casper did not fill out much of the document. Instead, he included many pieces of loose-leaf paper that underpinned his claims. He also attached various exhibits in support of his claims.\\n\\nThe Magistrate Judge and the District Court both directed Casper to refile his suit on a proper prisoner complaint form, and complete all sections accordingly, making additional attachments only when necessary. Casper rejected these instructions and claimed that his choice of the original format was strategic.\\n\\nAccording to Casper, the original lawsuit's format was best suited to his strategy. Consequently, he requested that the District court allow the case to proceed with the complaint served on the defending parties. The District Court, however, denied his request on the grounds that it was improperly formatted. Instead, the District Court ruled in favor of dismissing the case without prejudice due to Casper's failure to comply with the court's request to refile on a court-approved prisoner complaint form.\\n\\nCasper took his claims to this Appeals Court under the purview of the U.S. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1291 statutory law. After considering the circumstances, the court decided to affirm the ruling of the District Court, denying Casper's insistence on proceeding in forma pauperis on the appeal. \\n\\nBack on 14th April 2023, Casper launched the suit, filing a pro se prisoner complaint setting forth claims as per the 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 rule of the United States Code. His complaint revealed that he was a convicted and sentenced state prisoner staying in a correctional facility based in Sterling, Colorado. \\n\\nCasper's initial complaint was mostly incomplete despite being issued by the court. He failed to properly fill out the sections, explicitly referring the court to the attached 'Claims Suffered' 1-26 in his 'STATEMENT OF CLAIM(S)' section. Several handwritten pages and supportive documents made up the remaining content of the 149-page complaint. The added documents claimed that all actions he was disputing took place within the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, between August 2020 and June 2021.\",\n          \"conditions are present.\\u201d The policy also instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. The policy does not specify how often employees should check for water accumulation, but it does state that \\u201cevery associate is responsible for customer safety.\\u201d\\n\\nDeakins filed a negligence lawsuit against Walmart in state court, alleging that Walmart breached its duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition by failing to keep the floor dry. He stated that Walmart knew or should have known that the floor was wet and posed a danger. Walmart removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.\\n\\nAfter discovery, Walmart filed a motion for summary judgment. It argued that Deakins could not establish that Walmart had actual or constructive knowledge of the water on the floor before Deakins slipped. In response, Deakins argued that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy created a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water.\\n\\nThe district court granted Walmart\\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that the surveillance video did not show that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have constructive knowledge of it. The court also found that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy was not evidence of negligence because the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining.\\n\\nThis appeal followed.\\n\\nII. Standard of Review\\n\\nWe review a district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards that bound the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate when \\u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d A dispute about a material fact is \\u201cgenuine\\u201d only if \\u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\\u201d We view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\\n\\nIII. Discussion\\n\\nUnder Florida law, to succeed on a negligence claim based on a slip and fall on a transitory foreign substance in a business establishment, a plaintiff must prove that the business had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and should have taken action to remedy it. Actual knowledge requires proof that the business was aware of the dangerous condition at the time of the slip and fall. Constructive knowledge can be proven by circumstantial evidence showing that (1) the dangerous condition existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of ordinary care, the business establishment should have known of the condition, or (2) the condition occurred with regularity and was therefore foreseeable.\\n\\nDeakins argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Walmart because a reasonable jury could find that Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. He contends that the surveillance video shows that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it and that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence.\\n\\nWe agree with Deakins that the surveillance video creates a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water. The video shows wet spots on the floor of the vestibule as shoppers enter the store, even before Deakins arrives. It also shows Deakins slipping on water that is not visible in the seconds before the slip, but is clearly visible afterward. While it is not completely clear from the video whether Deakins himself tracked the water in from outside the store or whether it was already present, a reasonable jury could infer from the video that the water was on the floor long enough for Walmart to have known about it.\\n\\nWe also agree with Deakins that Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy is evidence of negligence. Although the policy was not in effect at the time of Deakins\\u2019 slip since it was not raining, the policy instructs employees to \\u201cmonitor all entrances and vestibules for water accumulation\\u201d and to \\u201cimmediately dry\\u201d any areas that get wet. This implies that Walmart recognizes the risk of water accumulation in its stores, even when it is not raining. A reasonable jury could infer from Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own policy that it was negligent.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we find that the surveillance video and Walmart\\u2019s failure to follow its own wet weather policy create a genuine question of fact about whether Walmart had constructive knowledge of the water on the floor. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Walmart and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nIV. Conclusion\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\nSO ORDERED.\\n\\nPER CURIAM:\\n\\nLAGOA, BRASHER, and ED CARNES, Circuit Judges, concur.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 400,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
